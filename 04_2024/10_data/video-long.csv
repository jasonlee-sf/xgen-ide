video_19785_167_6qr3y000000odthAAA,"Agent: I know that some, some couldn't make it, so we'll record so we can share this.
Agent: [PERSON-1], Noble, [PERSON-2], anyone else from [ORG-1]'s side joining [DATE-1] or no?
Agent: Are we good to jump in and get started?
Agent: I think we're good.
Agent: Awesome. Great. So again, guys, really appreciate all of your time. I know that I've got a chance to meet and have discussions with each one of you guys here throughout [DATE-2].
Agent: I know it's [DATE-3] for you. Wanted to make a couple of introductions just to, I'm not sure if everyone has met [PERSON-3] before. I think you guys are familiar with [PERSON-4].
Agent: But from a high level [DATE-1], what we wanted to do is align with you guys here. We're approaching the end of obviously the calendar and [ORG-2]'s [DATE-4].
Agent: Wanted to just talk through, you know, what's top of mind for you guys. We had talked about a couple of different projects on the marketing front.
Agent: Also wanted to, in previous conversations, was speaking with [PERSON-1] and Noble, potentially about how other auto dealer customers are leveraging the personalization aspect of marketing cloud.
Agent: And so, [PERSON-5], I wanted to walk you through some of the use cases and related to what help you guys strengthen and power some of your current investment that you have in [LOC-1] [DATE-1] with regards to conversions.
Agent: But starting off, I really just wanted to get an idea and understanding for where you guys are, what's top of mind. We want to make sure we're being the partners and supporting you guys with value.
Agent: And then we can take it from there as far as next steps go. So, again, this is a relatively loose agenda. I think [DATE-1] will be a combination of both.
Agent: Discussion, a little bit of discovery at RM, and then some Enablement to walk you guys through some of the use cases, you know, particularly with it, personalization can open up for you guys.
Agent: [PERSON-1], Noble, does this sound okay to you guys?
Agent: Anything else you were hoping to cover or get out of [DATE-1]'s call?
EndUser: No, it sounds perfect, thanks.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: All right, awesome. So smaller team from the salesforce side of things, as you know, we normally like to bring the full bus. [DATE-5] we wanted to keep it to a cleaner team.
Agent: I'm [PERSON-6], obviously your [LOC-1] account executive based in [GPE-1]. I'm up in your neck of the woods quite often.
Agent: I always wind up seeming to miss you guys, but I'm a sales force [DATE-6] and our entire team specifically focused on the automotive and Manufacturing industry.
Agent: [PERSON-3], I will let you make your own intro. Yeah, thanks [PERSON-7]. [PERSON-1] and [WORK_OF_ART-1], great to see you again.
Agent: You guys obviously know who I am, but [PERSON-8], I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting at I am the account director aligned to [ORG-3] for [ORG-2] overall.
Agent: And so, [PERSON-7] partners with me on the marketing side, but then I can help with any other side of the business as well.
Agent: So, I've talked to [PERSON-1] and Noble a lot of times, but it's great to get to meet you [DATE-1], [PERSON-8], and I'll probably stay quiet, my statistic.
Agent: This call since this is [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-5] show [DATE-1] But if you ever need anything, I'm always her e
EndUser: As a point of contact to reach out to .
Agent: Perfect. Thank you. I believe you guys have met [PERSON-5].
Agent: It might have been a bit, but [PERSON-5], let you go and introduce yourselves. Hey everyone, [PERSON-1], I don't think you and I have probably [DATE-7].
EndUser: Chatted for a couple
Agent: And that was back when I mean. Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah, and you're probably helping me with some point of view framing just for automotive industry specific use cases. So I hope you're doing well.
Agent: Great to see you again. No, [PERSON-9], you and I have been on a couple calls [DATE-8]. Right, tells me you're a [ORG-4] fan. I'm a [ORG-5] fan, but also a [ORG-6] fan. So congratulations on the.
Agent: The [GPE-2]'s internment
Agent: Went against my Pacers. And then, when they... Oh, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, of course, of course. And then, when they... I'm not sure that we've been on calls before, but great to meet you.
Agent: I'm solution engineer here at [ORG-2], support [PERSON-7], all his accounts from a technical perspective. I've been at [ORG-2] for [DATE-9] now, so I appreciate everyone taking the time during a busy time of year.
Agent: Awesome. Thanks, [PERSON-5].
Agent: Yeah, there was something weird about seeing [PERSON-10] and company pop champagne bottles and goggles here in [DATE-10], but hey, I do like what the [ORG-7] was doing in the... into the [GPE-2]'s tournament at some additional levels of excitement.
Agent: So awesome. So with that, I know obviously you guys doing no-able.
Agent: [PERSON-1], [PERSON-13], do you want to just make a quick intro for yourself as well and just a quick overview on your role since I know you hadn't had a chance to align with [PERSON-3]?
EndUser: Sure, I'm the marketing manager for [ORG-3]. So I oversee all the marketing initiatives for all of the locations.
Agent: Awesome. Great, thanks. So I wanted to just start [DATE-1] and just try to keep this a little bit initially conversational for the time being right now.
Agent: Before we jump into slides and some of what we prepared on the personalization front.
Agent: [PERSON-15], we had talked about some additional side projects [DATE-8], potentially even utilizing SMS and mobile notifications for product recalls, things of that nature.
Agent: I've wanted to just pause because I know that obviously given some of the [GPE-3] locations have now been sold off from what I understand, I just wanted to sort of re-center our conversation and our understanding of where you guys are [DATE-1], what the landscape is from a growth perspective and then any additional projects or marketing initiative s that maybe we hadn't [ORG-8] d before we kind of dive i n specific to virtualization stuff .
EndUser: Yeah, let me kind of take that on first.
EndUser: So, um, with regard to the SMS shortcode that was approved by the aggregators and we are working on actually integrating that into [LOC-1] now and it will be available in [DATE-13] for guests to start enrolling in so we're actually doing.
EndUser: We will be doing the actual enrollment email and the strategy for that coming up in [DATE-15] with myself [PERSON-14] to get the team enrolled in that as I said before with the team here and as obviously that team knows At 68 is extremely easy.
EndUser: That's ourselves worst platform And we have a lot of things going on so we're absolutely interested in seeing the personalization items [DATE-1] And what you know potential it has for the future But as of right now the program is very over-subscribed, so we definitely wanted to take a look at it But yeah, we have a lot of ongoing initiatives in general.
EndUser: Noble and I don't know if you want to add any additional items or contacts up, but just as a general update.
Agent: No, I think that's fair. We're pretty close on all the SMS stuff. But yeah, our art to-do list for [GPE-4] is huge. And things that we're supposed to launch last
Agent: [DATE-10] haven't launched yet. For certain smaller areas. So yeah, we're just trying to get through it. Okay, got it. What would you say are some of the bigger like key priorities,
Agent: You know, for you guys, even if it's not necessarily marketing related, just so that we were aware of. You know, not necessarily competing priorities, but just kind of where things fall and you're in what you're working on.
Agent: Just also
Agent: The thing about a cardial issue is it's really depending on the store, you know, for five different businesses in one essentially because you've got the different departments.
Agent: Yeah, and they all have their different needs and different ways they interact with customers.
Agent: And so, you know, we're trying to get like our amenities operations integrated in for to do all that can be tracked and then that kind of thing.
Agent: We've service has been up and running for a while, and then [DATE-8] is going to be getting the rest of the stores, or [DATE-14] is going to be getting the rest of the stores live on the sales side.
Agent: Except, five pilot stores on it right now.
EndUser: We have
Agent: Is it four [PERSON-1]?
Agent: Four?
Agent: Yeah. Wait, no, it's five. No, it's five.
Agent: Yeah, I had it right.
Agent: You know, just getting things wrapped up, getting things rolled out. So, okay. Awesome. Well, that's great. Great just remind me, as far as how many location rooftops are to hear.
Agent: And now,
Agent: We at now with kind of, was there two in [GPE-3] that we're sold off?
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Yeah. Two. Okay.
Agent: And so how many we have total now under [ORG-1]?
Agent: So we've got 13 like, maybe other ships, and then there's some other smaller satellite locations like, Depending on the store, there might be a separate smaller rooftop for [ORG-9] For you know the vans and has a [ORG-10] used car lot so we don't always count those as separate dealerships But just 20 sort of proper rooftops and then probably like five or so smaller ones then like [ORG-13].
Agent: Okay, great. That's helpful info. And then just lastly on the SMS piece, great to hear that that's kind of moving forward.
Agent: I know I'd referred you guys, and I forget if it was List Engage or Off-Prem regards to the mobile partner to help
EndUser: You do the short code provisioning setup. Did you guys start
Agent: List Engage?
Agent: List Engage and it was [PERSON-14], and he's exceptional. I really love him. Awesome, great. I'm glad that's working out.
Agent: And so I just wanted to make sure from a timing standpoint, as we talked about, I know initially you know what you were like, hey, I think we finally found a use case for this and we were looking to maybe start this over [DATE-14], but knowing that, you know, obviously the mobile provisioning takes a little bit longer, things move a little slower.
Agent: I just want to make sure that you guys are
EndUser: On a good track with the M-Or if there's any help you need [DATE-15] in regards to that. No, we're in a really good place with them. Like I said, we're almost towards the tail end of it.
EndUser: I can't The thing that could slow down a little bit was some of the internal stuff on the policy side getting that approved.
Agent: Say enough good things about [PERSON-14].
Agent: Of things and otherwise we're in a really good place and he did an exceptional job with everything.
EndUser: But
Agent: I think we're good there. I'm glad to hear it. Give me a post that if we can help. I think right now and I'll send a follow up with this.
Agent: You guys have access to I think it's about 2,410 [ORG-15] messages for mobile SMS, but those get used up, you know relatively quickly I know initially you were planning to do sort of a small test kind of use case with that So we'll monitor that and as you guys get ready to sort of you know start launching campaigns Those can be added at any time so nothing that needs to take action immediately right now unless you guys are looking to launch something here in [DATE-13] I just want to make sure that you don't get dinged with over just on so So we can always take that offline or discuss whatever that's ready.
Agent: Cool. With that being said, I wanted to shift gears a little bit. We had talked a little bit about some personalization.
Agent: I've had some kind of siloed conversations initially with [PERSON-1] just a little bit, [WORK_OF_ART-1], saying there was interest.
Agent: I believe you guys had mentioned also that you had started to Maybe not necessarily experiment, but try to work with some additional vendors with regards to whether it was personalization or I couldn't remember who that was with if it was like an initial trial or proof of concepts.
Agent: And I was just kind of curious to see maybe [PERSON-1], you could fill us on where [ORG-1] is with regards to just any tools that you guys have explored to this point.
Agent: And the initial use cases that you guys were looking at with personalization. Thank you, I might be talking about it in a [ORG-14], [PERSON-1].
EndUser: Yes, so we're basically we're going to kind of keep that high level generalized for now.
EndUser: Yeah, we are looking at a potential data source provider and we're going to be doing a send actually in [DATE-20] based on some initial data with them.
EndUser: We actually had a discussion with their CEO [PERSON-15] and I [DATE-20] back and they did some updates based upon my feedback to them. And so we're going to be looking at potentially doing
Agent: Another pilot with them, but that's kind of where we're going to. I think we'll keep it for now at that level,
EndUser: Just until we know more
Agent: About what we're going to do with them. OK, got it.
Agent: And you said, what was the name of the vendor?
Agent: Was it Intercept?
Agent: Intercept. Correct. Intercept. Yeah, because initially we had reached out to our sales so
Agent: [PERSON-20] at the time for [LOC-1] that maybe [DATE-20] trying to find a vendor like this. So I think that's why it kind of ended up in their notes.
Agent: And [PERSON-1], what was the kind of initial use case that you landed on with them?
Agent: And what kind of data just for my own understanding?
EndUser: What sort of third-party additional data are they providing you all with?
Agent: Just would love to understand
EndUser: Some of the initial use cases that you all were thinking about with them?
EndUser: Yeah, it's about website tracking. So basically, it's a pixel on the website's track who is coming to the website. And then it provides, in theory, a lot of personalized data based on that person.
EndUser: The feedback that I gave them again, I'm just gonna keep high level for now and I'll have respect for them based on where we're at with them.
EndUser: The data that came back was somewhat questionable in some of the people that we ran through the system as actual use cases for all of their data. And so I provided that feedback to their team.
EndUser: So again, we had [PERSON-15] and I have that discussion with their CEO [DATE-31] and their technical team. And they are actually making updates to their software based on the feedback, which was great. [LOC-2] was great.
EndUser: And so we're going to again be doing another test with them to see if actually the feedback You know produces any tangible results that would be helpful for us But the use cases effectively to just have great more granular tracking and the website level
Agent: To be able to understand what that's are doing and then be able to put them in appropriate journeys And more specialized journeys based upon what they are doing at any given time. Okay, perfect.
Agent: That's that's all great to you That's great clarity for me.
Agent: And I think what we'll be talking about [DATE-1] will be some of those similar areas that you're maybe exploring with [FAC-1] now so we can just kind of have a conversation around maybe some of the tracking that they're doing and how does that compare to some of the tracking that's being done by personalization.
Agent: So I think some of the [ORG-14] we prepared [DATE-1] will be will be beneficial for that.
Agent: Really quickly, for [WORK_OF_ART-1], Tom, Lene, how much of an understanding, have you had any conversations around personalization in the past?
Agent: I don't believe you have, any sort of familiarity with the product.
EndUser: But just would love to understand if there's
Agent: Directly from marketing cloud, do you mean?
EndUser: Personalization within marketing known as [PRODUCT-1]: Cloud, the product Personalization. No, I haven't. I've done a very high-level generalization. Okay, Noble for [ORG-15].
Agent: Perfect. LaNae, similar
Agent: Similar, yeah. OK, not too familiar.
Agent: Yeah, OK, so I think if you all are OK with it, what I was thinking where we could spend the time [DATE-1] is we put together some slides around one, like helping you all understand some of the tracking that the solution does, but also trying to frame it in from the perspective of some of the different use cases that we could start to think about specific to your industry.
Agent: I think that'll be a good way to get some conversation going around some of the cases. capabilities.
Agent: And if it's something that you all are interested in exploring further based on what we cover off on [DATE-1], I think what would be great is, you know, on a futur e call, we come back to you and present really a personalized demonstration on a specifi c use case that we can kind of discuss [DATE-1] that would be most S o it's only a good use of time for [DATE-1] .
Agent: Relevant for you all.
Agent: Sure. Perfect. Cool.
Agent: Do you want to cover off on some of those initial slides and we'll get into some use cases?
Agent: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. All right. So real quick, before we jump into the use cases here, this is a little bit of a nice breaker. So bear with me. I'm going a little bit off the cuff here.
Agent: And [PERSON-5] always cringes a little bit when I decide to put this in. This is a slide and an exercise that I do depending on the audience. But I love working with [ORG-1]. I like [PERSON-20].
Agent: So real quick, you know, bear with me, we talked about marketing objectives.
Agent: Take a step back, right?
Agent: These two folks, you guys know who they are, right?
Agent: Just an exercise in personalization. Feel free to shout out [PERSON-1], [PERSON-13], Noble.
EndUser: Who are these guys and what do they have in common?
EndUser: [PERSON-20] and the Prince, or I'm sorry, the King now.
Agent: Aren't they both from [GPE-5]?
Agent: They are, correct.
Agent: Yes, so very good, right?
Agent: So at a high level glance, right, when we talk about basic level segmentation, when you're sending out segments, right, a lot of times you have a lookalike audiences, right?
Agent: You look at both of these two individuals, right?
Agent: On paper, both born in [DATE-20], right?
Agent: Both grew up in [GPE-5]. Both up two kids. Both been married twice, believe it or not. Obviously, they're both wealthy. Both spend [DATE-31] holidays in the [LOC-3]. They're both dog lovers.
Agent: And then to your point, they're both princes, right?
Agent: Prince of [GPE-5], Prince of darkness. So on paper, the whole point of this is other than it being a little cheeky, understanding that.
Agent: A lot of times on paper, when you're doing segmentation, a basic level one two many audiences, the way that you would interact with an individual might be very different if you had [PERSON-20] step into the dealer or interact with you guys than you would [PERSON-31]
Agent: It's kind of more of just a fun little exercise that sort of tees up as getting into the conversation and the value of one-to-one personalization, and that personas are fundamentally different.
Agent: But the approach [DATE-1] and what industry best dealers are doing right now is being able to know and track and understand, affinities, behaviors, you know, that goes beyond just you know, a rock and roll star versus, you know, a royal family.
Agent: But in regards to jus t model, make, you know, is it a soccer mom?
Agent: Is it an EV enthusiast?
Agent: Right?
Agent: Is it an executive Right?
Agent: So, just really being able to understand and relate to them on a personalized way . Alright, thanks for bearing with me on that. I just want to make sure sometimes people are paying attention. So.
Agent: When we talk about personalization, I'm going to get through this pretty quick, because you guys already start to see some of the value in this, given that you've already started to work with some other folks like [FAC-1] on this.
Agent: But bottom line is the experience of carbine [DATE-19] has become a key differentiator. And it's almost as important to the customer right now as the actual purchase themselves.
Agent: The customers want to be able to match the quality of the vehicle, especially with you guys and some of the name luxury brands. in terms of the car buying experience.
Agent: Of marketers say that customers, they expect [DATE-19] in this new generation of the [ORG-20], the generation why they expect companies to know and brands to understand them.
Agent: Two, it's highly competitive, right?
Agent: They all start their process online now before they even set foot in the dealer.
Agent: And so the question becomes, how can we then marry their digital experience with the onset experience that they receive when they set foot on the dealership?
Agent: And then lastly and most importantly, I'm sure you guys are not attuned to it, but every dollar is now held accountable in terms of cost per lead, in terms of, you know, add budgets, in terms of being able to prove conversions, you know, ROI and lifetime value for customers.
Agent: Right. So some of the just high level, you know, main themes that we see in terms of the dealership experience is being able to have a full connected relationship with your customer rather than just basic level segmentation.
Agent: That starts with collecting first party audience data. We all know that the third party cookie is crumbling.
Agent: And so having that data and being able to know and understand and be able to segment and enrich that data, and then be able to then leverage and activate that data becomes paramount, both in top of funnel acquisition, but also in terms of nurturing.
Agent: Things like, automated service reminders, product recall notifications like we talked about. You know, the list goes on and on, you know, throughout those touch points in the customer journey.
Agent: And so the value of being able to personalize at scale is really, you know, now almost become a necessity, you know, for when you're competing for these customers. I'm going to pause here.
Agent: Does this make sense in terms of just kind of like what we're trying to achieve and some of the value drivers that it produces in terms of, you know, return on ad spend.
Agent: Higher quality leads,
Agent: Um, the first party data.
Agent: Any questions on this?
Agent: Now seems pretty straightforward. Perfect. All right.
Agent: I'm going to get through this pretty quick because I think that it would probably be better spent, you know, getting into use cases here since you guys all seem, you know, pretty savvy to understand the value of personalization.
Agent: But really, it just comes throughout the customer lifecycle, like I mentioned, from top of funnel, unknown, you know, web browsing customers, to being able to start to engage them, to then be able to then get them into the funnel and pass them over to sales, ultimately, to get them to, you know, the point of a test drive, a purchase consideration, whether it be additional accessories, whether it be additional vehicles within them.
Agent: In the household and then ultimately becom e in a [ORG-1]'s brand fan that [ORG-20] y when they're in a buying cycle or decisioning process their question doesn't become what dealer should I go to Who am I gonna shop the best price with But it's the experience that I have in [ORG-1] They know me, they take care of m e and I'm immediately gonna go back to the m for all my automotive needs All right .
Agent: The tool that and the solution that we're talking about formally was branded interaction studio. As you guys know, [ORG-2] love to change Marketing Cloud product names. It feels like [DATE-31].
Agent: So interaction studio was rebranded to Marketing Cloud personalization [DATE-19], [DATE-19].
Agent: And really what this is, is this is a tool and a solution that sits within the Marketing Cloud platform that really bolts on to Marketing Cloud engagement and journey builder, which you guys have [DATE-1], which allows us to basically place that pixel on the website, like you mentioned, and start to track browsing behavior, intense for both anonymous and unknown web visitors, as well as being able to recognize.
Agent: Nice . and stitch together profiles and unified customer profiles for customers based on both purchase history as well as their behavioral insights as well. So we can then leverage that to be able to display dynamic content.
Agent: The exact eClass vehicle that [PERSON-7] was searching for online.
Agent: We can retarget him with an email, a [ORG-20] ad, or even when I come back to the website with dynamic [ORG-14] to show the particular vehicle rather than a static homepage to drive engagement and conversion.
Agent: From a high level, you know, we're seeing, you know, for you guys, this seems like a natural progression because you're seeing value out of marketing cloud, but even just being able to take it that step further of personalizing these for your customers, especially when you're dealing with, you know, a purchase that's a vehicle, right?
EndUser: That's more than maybe a cup of coffee or $[MONEY-1] widget. You know, the cost per lead and the value of a client becomes much, much more significant.
EndUser: What do you do when you actually when it gets to the website or anonymous gets
Agent: To the website and they have what we would call bebacks so in other words we're tracking how many times they come to the website over a period of time how does this software handle that It handles it.
Agent: There's a variety of different things that we can start to do with it.
Agent: So we'll track that individual as long as they don't clear their cookies, right?
Agent: We'll track that individual every session they have on the website. We'll talk about some of the levels of tracking that we do. So time spent.
Agent: Developing what we call an affinity profile that essentially helps us understand make model trim new versus used.
Agent: Where's that interest fly?
Agent: And then you can use those folks when they're anonymous in a variety of different ways so you can target them with different campaigns that we have out of the box, whether that's specific calls to action for them.
Agent: [PERSON-20] tank campaigns is another example.
Agent: So if they start to leave the website, but they're still anonymous We want to try to capture some piece of information about them before they leave We can start to essentially just provide a specified experience for anonymous folks, but it's got a lot of stability [PERSON-31]: What data can you provide to us about like the actual person themselves?
EndUser: So as an example, They provide like hobbies and political facilities since not that we're going to use all of that stuff.
Agent: It's like intersect.
EndUser: But like let's hone in on hobbies for a second. So like let's say, you know, this person's been visiting the website 19 times or whatever.
EndUser: And do you have a database that you tap into or that is available that would show like a profile for what this who this person is potentially?
Agent: So for that piece, no, like we won't provide that information in terms of data that we do provide back. It's generally like a locational information based on IP address to understand where they're located, things of that nature.
Agent: We're not going to be that third party data provider.
EndUser: What about opt-in?
EndUser: So like do you know if they're on the do not call list, like the national do not call list based upon their IP address or who you potentially think that you're resolving them to be?
Agent: We would not know that. We don't know who they specifically are until they provide us with a name or an email address. So think about a form completion, something like that.
Agent: Yeah, these are all good questions that I wanted to delineate between personalization. And because I'm not as familiar with [FAC-1], the personalization aspect, [PERSON-1], is going to help us to be able to track the behavioral characteristics.
Agent: So as [PERSON-5] mentioned.
Agent: If [PERSON-7] comes to [ORG-3] and as an anonymous web visitor based on my IP address, until I actually raise my hand by filling out a form with my email, I'm really just essentially kind of just an anonymous almost think of it like a unique anonymous identifier, like a number that's a social security number that gets assigned based on my IP address.
Agent: Anonymously though, you do have the ability to be able to track my browsing history, my time on site, you know, number of page views, which vehicles I'm looking at, and then ultimately the goal is to be able to take all that behavioral data to then lean in to provide a personalized experience to say, hey, here, go ahead, raise your hand, fill out this form.
Agent: And then the magic kind of happens where we can then turn the unknown browser into a known user and stitch together we have.
Agent: Any additional information
Agent: Now that can be information coming that's logged already in [ORG-2] or information that you have from other third parties.
Agent: However, being able to introduce third party data, while [ORG-2] is not a data provider, we have a lot of customers that utilize data from third party data providers like [ORG-31], like [ORG-20] and [GPE-6], like you know, several others that are even in the luxury auto space in [GPE-7] that have other independent lists, you know, regarding, you know, net worth individuals.
Agent: So we can certainly ingest that and we can talk about that as well because that is a use case that a lot of folks provide. But personalization is not a data provider.
Agent: It really just builds and rich profiles with the information, both the
Agent: Behavioral info that as well as purchase and influencing data that you have within [ORG-2].
EndUser: They have on the website
Agent: So show you
EndUser: Like some piece of the bank, [ORG-31]. tied into sales, of course. Yeah, OK. Right, so another, yeah, exactly. And it was like, another word you're just tracking kind of, not that it's not important.
EndUser: And obviously that would be very valuable. But it's tracking. [PERSON-1]'s come to the website. You don't know that it's [PERSON-1]. But I've come to the website multiple times and I've clicked on this vehicle and this vehicle and service.
EndUser: And I've done all these different things. So it's tracking like a composite of whatever that whoever this person is. We don't know who
Agent: They are. But it's tracking a composite to try to guess what their intent potentially is. Yeah, that's a good way to think about it. We've got some visuals to showcase.
Agent: Essentially, like the exact data points that we start to track
Agent: And what that profile starts to look like both in the anonymous and the known state. [PERSON-5], I think it might help, but if we maybe jump right into some of these use cases, a visual standpoint
Agent: I think that would help from to showcase what we're describing a little bit, to get a better understanding.
Agent: Is that where it will go?
Agent: Some good. Do you want me to drive slides or
Agent: Do you want to?
Agent: Yeah, go ahead. That's fine.
Agent: So we start with a fictitious customer, [PERSON-19], who comes to [ORG-3] for the first time. We can start to understand that [PERSON-19], based on his browsing behavior, is his first time here, based on his IP address.
Agent: This happens through a pixel in personalization that gets placed on [ORG-3] website. So as he continues to browse, we can start to build up this anonymous profile that we just talked about of [PERSON-19].
Agent: We don't know that he's [PERSON-31] just yet. He hasn't provided us any information.
Agent: But all we do know is kind of where he's navigating, where his intent lies, how much time he's spending on the website, which vehicles he's looking at, potentially articles that he's reviewing as well.
Agent: So [PERSON-7], just go ahead and click through, right?
Agent: So essentially what we're doing is any individual that comes to the site, whether they are anonymous or known, what we start to do is build out what we call an affinity profile.
Agent: So [PERSON-7], go ahead and click through here. I don't know why it's not showing up, but this is an example of that anonymous profile that we build up. This all sits within marketing clouds.
Agent: So if you think about your different studios that you have within marketing cloud, it's essentially just another studio that gets added onto your Marketing Cloud instance.
Agent: So we see some of those data points that we'll start to capture based on location and IP address So this individual is anonymous We don't know who they are . but they're from the [GPE-8], [GPE-9] area.
Agent: Now, over time, once that individual becomes known, and in our book, they become known once they fill out some sort of form, apply for financing, fill out a contact us form, things of that nature, we just continue to build on this profile.
Agent: Now, let's look at a zoomed in view of this, just to take a look at kind of the understanding that we start to build up of every individual. So, [PERSON-19], go ahead and click through.
Agent: And if we zoom in on specifically what we call our affinity profile, this is what gets built up about every individual that comes to the site.
Agent: And we break this down based on vehicles that they're viewing, how long they spend viewing specific vehicles. So we're keeping that time tracking element of it.
Agent: And then ultimately, right, like once they actually purchase or lease a vehicle, we break it down from that perspective as well. So it's all based on your inventory, the catalog that you have of the vehicles that you sell.
Agent: And we're breaking it down by based on different dimensions around those vehicles. So make, model.
Agent: New versus used, what type of vehicle is it?
Agent: Is it a specific trim that this individual is most interested in, whether it's more premium versus more entry-level options when it comes to trim level?
Agent: You could also think about just budgetary numbers, what price range is this individual starting to look at?
Agent: All of that can be captured. The way that we do that is one, the pixel itself tracks the views, the time spent, etc.
Agent: But what it also does is that it essentially just builds up a catalog of all the different vehicles that you have on your website.
Agent: And with that catalog, it builds up that understanding around the different dimensions of that vehicle.
Agent: So then when a visitor comes to the site and views different vehicles, we can trace that back to things like we're taking a look at here to help us understand what we call affinities and ultimately individual.
EndUser: [PERSON-19] or an anonymous What is he or she most interested in?
EndUser: We can you go as [ORG-19] [PRODUCT-2] [PRODUCT-3]. Is that just an, is
Agent: That like an example of like, you're not tracking it across all different websites. It's just that you're just showing that they can do whatever make it is. Is like, you know, you obviously sell like new and used cars.
EndUser: That correct?
EndUser: Yeah, right.
Agent: So They might not all be [ORG-19], right?
Agent: So if, if someone's like [PERSON-19] is on [ORG-31] and is also looking at used vehicles that aren't [ORG-19], right?
Agent: Like we can still pick up on that. Granted, you're right. Tell them like most of the vehicles probably are going to be [ORG-19]. We would see that reflected in someone's profile. file
EndUser: . We can have this set up across multiple sites if we'd like to. I was cross pixelization.
Agent: Just going to ask that is our
EndUser: So like for instance, like let's say in [GPE-10], we have [ORG-19] and [ORG-19] literally across two from each other. Let's say they shop at [ORG-19] over to [ORG-19].
Agent: Or they were shopping at [ORG-19] say, and then they go
EndUser: Would we be able to pick that up on this IP address?
EndUser: So they say that if they're shopping at multiple sites?
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: Based on based on What about service?
Agent: Service.
EndUser: I would have
Agent: A service profile. So like let's say they come in and they're not shopping for a car at all. They're doing service. And kind of tracking that.
Agent: Is that something that can be done as well?
Agent: Right. Yeah. So all of that will be tracked. And that part might not be, I mean, it can be built into this profile as well. We would just have another section of it that is.
Agent: Is this person more interested in buying a new vehicle, leasing a vehicle, or service?
Agent: For example, might be like the way
Agent: That we start to break it down.
Agent: But sort of at the end of this when you get a tracking ID turned into a person, right?
Agent: It happens based on someone filling out a web form. Filling out a web form or like, right, suppose that we stand this up [DATE-1] on your website.
Agent: Like, we can't go back, right?
Agent: And like retroactively capture all the data.
Agent: So it can be if someone, if someone fills out a form, if you send like an email and we pick up on that referral source of them coming to the website from something like, for example, a [LOC-1] email, we then know who that individual is that way.
Agent: So there's, there's other ways that it can be done outside of just filling out
Agent: A form, but that's the most clear one, if you will.
Agent: So it's mainly form or if they click from an email.
EndUser: Yeah, those are going to be those are two main ways that we'd start to
Agent: Pick up on it. Well, if
Agent: They click from an email, we already know who they are, right?
EndUser: Yeah, we stitch it together, right?
EndUser: Okay, one other quick question if I could so with regard to the anonymous person, so like as we said about the bebacks. So I just want to clarify something you said, [PERSON-5].
EndUser: So if they don't play their cookies or whatever, and they come back and then they tend days later, they come back again and then the [ORG-14] they fill out the form, but those proceeding days, they were there like three or four times.
EndUser: Is all that history track then till now that it's
Agent: Robbed that we know it's robbed?
Agent: Is that tracked or no?
Agent: Yes, because you should go back. Go back. Go back one slide. Look at that. Look at that larger profile. So this isn't a great example, but below that affinity profile, should have been a larger picture by that.
Agent: There's a timeline, right?
Agent: So that orange component there, that orange component at the very end of that timeline, it's colored. That indicates that there was like, it typically indicates like a conversion. So we'll track those all over time.
Agent: And then the larger the bubble, that essentially just indicates a longer session. So like a longer amount of time on the site. So we'll track that again, even when they're anonymous, up into the point that they do convert.
Agent: And when they do convert, we'll take any anonymous data that we've captured from an affinity perspective, and then it'll become part of that known profile. Okay. Yep. Great. So this profile can be used in a lot of ways.
Agent: For example, you know, [PERSON-7] and I, we were on the phone with a customer [DATE-19]. One of their use cases is.
Agent: They want to do communications to folks that are showing strong interest in [ORG-19], high-end talent was what they called it. So for them, that primarily is based off of time spent browsing specifically electric vehicles.
Agent: So we can utilize that data within that profile to start to utilize it for segmentation.
Agent: So just as an example, give me folks that have viewed been browsing electric vehicles for [TIME-1] in [DATE-31].
Agent: Or give me individuals that favorit e vehicle category is electric vehicle, just as an example in favor, that refers back to that affinity profile. That's going to be someone's top specific area of engagement based on those different affinities.
Agent: You could also use it for a variety of different what we call triggers that come out of the box with the platform. So, for example, like an abandoned event.
Agent: So, if we know who they are, individuals that partially completed a form for financing, for example, but didn't get all the way through the process.
Agent: Could be an example of one use case that we could deploy through the out of the box triggering mechanisms that come with the tool. Next slide, [PERSON-7]. This is kind of an anonymous user example.
Agent: So suppose someone comes to the website, we don't know who they are. They start browsing [ORG-19] used vehicles. They see that the make or the trim level that they're looking for isn't currently in stock.
Agent: So as an example, suppose that they start to leave the website. The tool comes with a variety of out-of-the-box, we call campaigns. One of them is an exit intent camera. campaign.
Agent: So it could be as they start to leave the website is the mouse starts to move toward s the corner. We trigger an alert targeted at those segments .
Agent: To try to capture some piece of information about them before they leave. It could be start the financing process.
Agent: Or another use case is if we see that someone's browsing a specific based on their filtering, vehicle or make model, et cetera, that's low in inventory, maybe it's just not the they don't have the trim level.
Agent: We don't have the trim level that they're looking for. So one other example of a call to action might be as they start to leave and as they start to leave, a provider email address or your phone.
Agent: Number will send you automated updates as new inventory comes into our location . So that plays into one of the triggers that comes out of the box is inventory based triggers.
Agent: So we can set up a rule that says if based on the website inventory and what's on the website, as vehicles come back into inventory based on someone's affinities and the vehicles they're interested in, we can send out automated SMS messages or automated [LOC-1] emails as that comes on kind of what's on the website.
EndUser: Back into inventory based If we know that. if we know them. Yep. I had another question on this.
EndUser: So as you're doing the exit thing and you know doing all this other stuff when Is this tool, can this tool be used to basically aggregate all the data that we're seeing sort of like [ORG-31] does?
EndUser: And the sense of like, okay, we see this behavior, you know, from 10 different individuals, when they go to this webpage, you know, they always exit, you know, stage left or whatever, because whatever they're doing beforehand.
EndUser: Because that would be powerful data in terms of knowing, like, is there something wrong with the website or like, you know, what is causing them to maybe exit or whatever?
EndUser: And then, as you said, like, triggering this behavior, does this tool do any of that based on all the data?
Agent: That it has, particularly for the anonymous people . I guess in general. All of the, it's a good question, [PERSON-1].
Agent: Let me go back and try to revisit like different reports that we have that come out of the box as it pertains to like anonymous users and some of the data that we provide back.
Agent: A lot of the reporting that does come out of the box that I'm a little bit more familiar with is like when you deploy one of these campaigns is a lot of what we end up doing is tracking we track like number of impressions, number of conversions, number of non-conversions, things of that nature.
Agent: But let me go back and see what reports come out of the box that are, if we have any that are in line with what you're asking about.
Agent: So, but most of the reports that I'm familiar with, they kind of lean into what I was just saying. But also another component of this is any campaigns that you do build out can be [ORG-31] tested.
Agent: So a lot of the reports also focus on that is if we want to try out multiple different experiences for trying to capture an anonymous user base,
EndUser: Which experience is the most performant in the world. in terms of, in this case, what we'd be most interested in which is form fills . lead acquisition. And that means inter-preservation, but certainly before we end.
Agent: If we could focus on this,
EndUser: I would like to see, and [PERSON-19] correct me if you know, if you want something different, but I would actually like to see four existing guests, because we've talked a lot about the anonymous piece.
EndUser: I would like to see for existing guests, what can we do on the journey build out?
EndUser: Because what we're trying to do is use our existing [ORG-2] database, now with data.
Agent: Because it's very rich
EndUser: Our Marketing Cloud instance obviously has all of our marketing that we've done to these people. And then if we put something like this on top of it, or as an overlay, It's giving us a rich set of analytics.
EndUser: So as a use case, as an example, entity.
Agent: [PERSON-1] is a known I start shopping
EndUser: I come in, on the website, I come back, I have a B-back. And [ORG-2] knows that we have an open lease retention campaign or lease retention opportunity as an example.
EndUser: I guess the first question is, how do these two, interact with these data sets?
Agent: How does marketing client [ORG-2]
EndUser: In other words, can we connect them together?
EndUser: Obviously, they're connected.
EndUser: But can we connect them together specifically?
EndUser: So then in real time, I know that [PERSON-1] just came into the website [PERSON-1] also has a least retention opportunity.
EndUser: And based on that behavior of what [PERSON-1]'s doing, I know, okay, he's about to apply for financing or he's doing something because that could either trigger an email campaign, an SMS, or it could actually trigger a personalization journey, meaning that we actually send an alert out to the salesperson or the sales manager at the store that says this person's actually ready to potentially convert to the sale, so they reach out to them right away.
EndUser: So those would be like the specific use cases.
EndUser: So how does this tool handle that in terms of being able to do the connection and be able to recognize?
EndUser: And also what parameters can we put in to say like if they apply for financing or if they do
Agent: This or they do that ?
Agent: Do these steps based upon the journeys like how that how does that work?
Agent: Yep, all right Well, we've got some [ORG-14] pertaining to that and we can kind of showcase what that might start to look like Skip past this one [PERSON-7] So you mentioned one use case, and I'll get into the sales force, like sales experience here in a moment.
Agent: But suppose you have a known user, right?
Agent: And somewhere within [PRODUCT-4], you've got data pertaining to vehicles that they currently have on lease with you all.
Agent: Um, in addition, also related to that, you might have like a lease end date that's stored as part of that vehicle that an individual owns. Suppose that's stored within [PRODUCT-4]. Let me know if it's not. But.
Agent: What we could utilize that data for is we could also utilize that for presenting a targeted web experience to a known user So for example, [PERSON-19], he's got a least [ORG-19] vehicle with us That expiration for that lease is up in [DATE-19] He comes back to the website We know who he is We might present him with a different call to action around explore lease and options, for example So it can update the experience in real-time that I receive when I come back to the website So all kinds of.. of strong capabilities here, whether it 's lease-end, service reminders,
EndUser: All kinds of different u se cases that we can start to think [PERSON-19] from a web experience [ORG-19] e. Brad, next slide. I really have a question. You know, you know, my question is everyone that works.
EndUser: One other question on that technically though, do we, because we have manufacturer requirements to use certain websites and stuff and vendors, does this interact with the website?
Agent: Or do we have to build our websites in this tool?
Agent: Like, because it seems like this tool is doing a lot of like website manipulation in the sense of like what it's serving up and pages and stuff.
Agent: How does that work?
Agent: It all just sits on And the tools primarily just going to interact with existing divs to replace [ORG-14] that exists on the website currently.
EndUser: Top of it.
Agent: Okay. Yep. But it can all have the same, like, look and feel branding, like CSS, etc. And all of them just kind of inherits that.
Agent: So it's not like a, it's not going to be like a drastically different look and feel for any campaigns that you end up deploying.
Agent: There's an element of this that sits in with like, there's a recommendation engine to this that can be plugged into [LOC-1] emails, as well as surface to a sales rep that's in [FAC-2] around recommendations.
Agent: So based on my recent browsing behavior, these are other vehicles that we think you'd be interested in. So plugs into [LOC-1] emails well.
Agent: And then the other side of this, to get into [PERSON-1], some of the things that you were mentioning is the salesperson experience. So if we know that someone has an upcoming. Really quick kind of piggybacking
EndUser: Off of [PERSON-1]'s question for the website.
EndUser: So would this in a sense be a micro site that's overlaying on top?
EndUser: Or would it still be [ORG-28] Mercedes dot com
Agent: That they're converting on?
Agent: But still be [ORG-28] Mercedes dot com.
EndUser: So when they fill out the form and convert, is that going into?
EndUser: The back end of our site, which then feeds into [ORG-2], or is it going into [ORG-2] directly?
Agent: It wouldn't change, like we're not talking about changing the order of operations here in terms of like where the data flows when someone fills out a form. We're just picking up on that conversion that takes place.
Agent: So if it goes into FJ286 you all right now, it would continue to operate that same in similar capacity.
Agent: Okay... Exactly... Yeah, as opposed to a microsite or take into like a separate like type landing page, [PERSON-13], personalization deploys a pixel or a beacon, if you will, that's on top the pixel on our site.
EndUser: Of [ORG-26]. Okay, so we just would include Correct.
Agent: Yes.
Agent: And then as part of the Implementation process, like it would either be like salt click or some or a personalization partner that would help you guys map out, you know, your website in terms of the areas that we would want to be able to personalize to then be able to offer dynamic content.
Agent: But there's no change to the actual website. It's compact.
Agent: Sorry, I have to be button compatible with your [ORG-26] and everything. So yeah, it's not like a separate microsite. It's just a pixel that you can deploy it on your existing website that then adjusts the information. Okay.
EndUser: After all this aside from this, do you guys have a live site of somebody else utilizing it that we could take a look at or do you have a dev site of actual?
Agent: The intention is, I can build out a demo that would, I have the ability to deploy this technology, I'm not actually deploying it to your site, but I can come and show a demonstration of what it would look like on your site.
Agent: But certainly I can provide you a couple examples of customers that are utilizing.
EndUser: As well that you can play around with. Okay, perfect,
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: So sales example, right, for someone that's maybe living in [ORG-28] 410. So that web activity can trigger something like an alert, for example, to that individual.
Agent: In that instance, we're gonna be leveraging kind of a combination of the data that's being captured by personalization. And, information that's stored in [PRODUCT-4].
Agent: So for example, we could have something like an automation that based on web behavior triggers someone to enter into a journey builder journey. from there within that journey.
Agent: Like, for example, and I'm not exactly familiar with how you've architected [FAC-2], but suppose on the contact or person account level, there's a roll-up summary field or something like that is like number of leases expiring in [DATE-28].
Agent: If that's greater than zero, we can use that as the decision point in a journey. And then based on that data point, trigger something like an alert to a sales person based on that web activity.
Agent: Letting them know that they've got an existing customer that's showing a lot of interes t and maybe they should be reaching out to them about lease and options Or you have a customer that you've worked with in the past that was on the website completed a financing application partially or started looking at financing options for a vehicle .
Agent: You should reach out to them or see how things are going with their current vehicle, right?
EndUser: Those are all use cases use case that you gave [PERSON-31], which was you know the hyper interest or whatever how much customization do we have over that like the one where they complete The finance from whatever that's a click into and so that would be like an action Well, like let's say they're just accumulating site visits.
Agent: On the first
EndUser: Can we identify
Agent: And say?
Agent: Don't send like an alert into like site visits reaches acts or they do certain behaviors. Yes and the way that you do that [PERSON-1] is We showed an example [PERSON-7].
Agent: I'm gonna ask you to click around exit on this slide If you'll mind go back to slide 14
Agent: So what you can do is when you're building out a segment, all of that information around all the tracking that we're doing can be utilized in segmentation. It's like [PERSON-1], to your example, let's drop folks into a segment.
Agent: If they've come to the website at least 10 times in [DATE-26], right?
Agent: We can deploy a segment off of that. Any segment that we build here is just an audience that we can use in a journey builder in either journey.
Agent: Builder or for just if you don't want to send any sort of [ORG-14] out to them, you coul d just do something like generate an automated task . There's also a component of this.
Agent: If you just wanted to send like [DATE-26] reports out to sales folks. So who's essentially fallen into this segment. They can also communicate it that way. I suppose probably the would be a task generation.
EndUser: More clean way to do it
Agent: So what you're, what you're asking about [PERSON-1] though, right in the wheel out of what we're talking about. Okay. Thanks. Yep. Sorry about that, [PERSON-19]. If you don't mind, go to slide 19. So generate something like an alert.
Agent: This information also surfaces so that affinity profile, when we were showing it earlier, we were showing it within [PRODUCT-5], but the details from an affinity perspective also surface within, can be surfaced within [PRODUCT-4].
Agent: So, [ORG-32] spent browsing specific vehicles, time spent browsing the website over the course of [DATE-32], etc.
Agent: As well as just what we call an engagement feed, that's just essentially the full like cookie crumb trail of like everything they've done on the website, all of that can be embedded within the [ORG-2] user interface.
Agent: So that we can have a more informed conversation with that individual or just know that someone is starting to express more interest based on their web activity.
EndUser: Sorry, I ran them questions before I forget it. You don't have to change the slide, [PERSON-28]. With regard to the anonymous, you give us the URL that they're coming source.
Agent: From, correct?
Agent: Or that's for the referral
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: There's also, well, I guess one other just thing that we can talk, we can showcase this a little bit more in a future call, but there is a variety of other data points that we do capture outside of just like locational information so we can use that location information for understanding like.
Agent: Weather in the area, things of that nature.
Agent: So I'll have to do some thinking on it, but my guess is there's probably some use cases around some of the data that we do provide that would be relevant to your industry.
Agent: We can talk about that in an actual demonstration once I think about it a little bit further. Okay, so this was the last slide that I wanted to showcase as it relates to some of the use cases.
Agent: Again, just kind of like taking a step back here.
Agent: Really what we're trying to do is that deep level of tracking for every individual that's coming to the site, anonymous and known, and then utilize that for deploying more personalized experiences, whether that's Marketing Cloud emails, potentially even, you know, like we showcased impacting my experience when I come to the website, but then also like making sure that this information gets over to someone in sales so that they know if they've got an existing customer that's starting to really express.
Agent: Strong signs of interest .
Agent: Thoughts on kind of what we covered off on.
Agent: Is this something we would want to explore in a demonstration?
Agent: I
Agent: Know you have a lot on your plate, so be honest with us.
EndUser: Yeah, I think it's actually an obviously in noble consignment as well. I think it's very interesting. I'll be candid. I think it's more interesting on the existing outside than on the anonymous side right now.
EndUser: But I think that the Any type of demo if we move forward, I think would be probably geared more towards that. And last on the anonymous side, absolutely we want to see the capabilities there.
EndUser: But anything we do on the anonymous side, I think, would be paired up with a data source that we would have via the intersect or something else.
EndUser: So that would need to prove itself out by getting more data because simply knowing the anonymous came in and did that stuff, we can get that through [ORG-31]. I mean, it's interesting for sure.
EndUser: But it's not like boiling the ocean per se.
EndUser: The stuff on the other side, though, I think, is actually the other side, I think, is actually much more interesting in terms of what we could do on the journeys and personalizing that, because I think that actually has more relevance to something that [PERSON-13] and I have kind of been on this journey on for a while, trying to find ways to do that.
EndUser: So I think that actually I think speaks more more to it in terms of like that. So I think if we did end up electing to do a demo, I think it should be there.
EndUser: But let me please chime in and know as well.
EndUser: Yes, fully in line with [PERSON-1]. I think we kind of maybe look at this in [DATE-19]. And see where we stand at that point.
EndUser: But yeah, I think for our current customers, this is in line with what we'd like to do.
EndUser: It's the low hanging fruit, right?
EndUser: Those are the people who are, we already have information. They know us as a brand, they trust us, but we're not guaranteed their next sale or even their next service.
EndUser: So, if we can get a better read on them, then absolutely.
Agent: Perfect. We can definitely plan to focus
EndUser: A little bit more on the known folks. I think
Agent: Too.
Agent: Did you have any side?
Agent: Did you have any feedback?
Agent: No, I think we agree. I think the best use case of it is on people we know because again it doesn't sort of enhance and try to figure out who people are from other data sets.
Agent: And so yeah, I think for us, I mean in terms of [DATE-10], it's not going to be the highest priority for us. But yeah, it's something we could definitely
EndUser: Look at like [DATE-41], a little more in depth. Yeah, so what I'm going to do guys is then we can go into the final section over coming up to time.
EndUser: I'm going to talk with [PERSON-15] about it during my one on one on [DATE-31].
EndUser: Just to let her know like the capabilities of what I saw kind of at high level and then let her know that you guys would potentially like to prepare a demo, whatever if we want to move forward.
EndUser: I'll let you guys know what her feedback is. And then we like we said we could prepare sometime in [DATE-19] for something like that.
EndUser: I mean to be candid, our plate is extremely full as I mentioned, but I do think that this actually adds.
Agent: This purchase, his service history, his behavioral history, as well as sales history, and then even any other third party data sources that come and play.
Agent: Just know that this would probably be a next logical step for you guys as you introduce datasets that don't primarily live in [ORG-2] [DATE-1].
EndUser: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah, no, I think that's actually interesting. I think we actually have a lot of that without maybe the third party data perspective.
Agent: I think in terms of the prioritization, at this personalization first and we keep an eye on this for the future.
EndUser: We definitely want to look Yeah, cool.
Agent: I think with that being said, the last thing that I will say, and I know we're pushing up right against time here, someone to let you guys have is, you know, noble, you probably know this right but in regards to just our, you know, timeline sales forces into fiscal right is [DATE-13] right so while I know we're pushing up against holidays and stuff here too, I would say, why don't we send this information to you guys, you know, slide where is a follow up.
Agent: So you can have the conversation with [PERSON-15] on [DATE-31], [PERSON-1], if it sounds like there's interest.
Agent: We're happy to schedule a follow-up more detaile d [PERSON-26] demonstration in the platform in [LOC-1] that's tailored to your use cases focusing kind of on the existing customer We can do that before, we can do it after the holidays But from my standpoint being able to get you guys best pricing if you guys are able to evaluat e and make a decision in [DATE-13] certainly we can probably pull some more string s to get you guys better discount s than we're normally able to leverag e to other stream times of [DATE-2] .
Agent: So, know you have a lot on your plate.
Agent: You know, we can take direction from you, but we are happy to run at this for you guys and see if, you know, it makes sense and gets you guys obviously a lot of dollar pricing.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I certainly appreciate that. I think the timing is going to be more driven by current prioritization level to be candid. I mean, it's very interesting software. I don't want the approval though predicated on.
EndUser: I don't want the approval to be potentially messed up based on timing because again, there are a lot of stuff.
EndUser: It will be a bit of a big sell actually, not necessarily to the business side actually, but to the [ORG-19] because he has very strict goals and guidelines for us on update 519.
EndUser: And it will have to be a very, very compelling use case for us to talk with him about funding additional things right now.
EndUser: Again, I think there's value here, but I don't want to rush it because I think we have to do it in the right timeline.
EndUser: Because this question is going to be the same one that I asked, I believe, which is how are you possibly going to implement this with everything else you have going on and all the top priorities I gave you.
EndUser: So that's kind of the lay of the land. So I don't want two forsake the software approval potentially for the timing. I do understand what you're saying. And obviously we'll take that into account.
Agent: But I want to make sure that we're driving it at the right time so that it doesn't kind of go
Agent: Into a little bit of a buzz off that makes sense. Absolutely. Look, and we'll take direction on that from you guys. Go ahead, man. Yeah, I was going to add in there too.
Agent: Like we hear you [PERCENT-1] we don't want to like sell you software that you're not going to be able to use right away, right?
Agent: But I think to [PERSON-7]'s point, if it is as we go through an evaluation, like if this is something that you guys find to be extremely valuable, getting the lowest price is something that we can only do in [DATE-13], but we can get creative on the contracting side to make the CFO happy, right?
Agent: Like we can push out start gates. We can kind of better align to the Implementation timeline that you guys do have when it comes to resourcing to make that. side of it justifiable as well too.
EndUser: So just because you buy in [DATE-13] doesn't mean that you hav e to start implementing a [DATE-13].
Agent: So this is something that keep in mind too . Okay, thank. Perfect. Yeah, I appreciate the time.
Agent: Any other questions?
Agent: Anything else you need from us?
Agent: I'll get you a copy of [DATE-1]'s recording. You can share with some of them as well as these slides.
Agent: And then why don't we touch base maybe right before we break for [DATE-41], maybe early part of [DATE-42],
EndUser: [PERSON-20], if that's all right after you have your conversation with [PERSON-15] and you can let us know kind of where you'd like to take things and what timeline looks like.
EndUser: Actually, could you do this, [PERSON-7], and [WORK_OF_ART-1], if you're okay with it. So I, and if it's too much work or whatever, just let me know.
EndUser: Could you give a preliminary, I mean, to the thing of pricing now again, please don't take this as it's going to be a fruit in [DATE-13], but could you give us a potential understanding of like what a pricing would look like because that will come into play at some point.
EndUser: Again, there's a lot of steps between now and then but if you could share that with noble
Agent: So we at least have a
Agent: Ballpark of what we're looking at, because that will help inform kind of our next steps as well and as we kind of look at it. Sure, I agree. I'm happy to do that.
Agent: I think there's a couple metrics on how to collect from you guys. Kind of like average website traffic is the primary one. Because a lot of things in marketing cloud, it's utilization phase.
Agent: And so we can build in the number of web traffic, make sure that we have you guys on the right version. And then that would give me a baseline to go to give you guys some pricing on it.
Agent: So I can shoot that over to you via email. And if you can get that back to me here before [DATE-46], I can probably turn around some
EndUser: High level price in [GPE-13]. Yeah, [PERSON-13], if it's not too much trouble again, like I know what's going on, could you maybe just give them the specs
EndUser: For like [ORG-41] since it's the law largest one?
EndUser: And then we could just
Agent: Get at least a ballpark pricing on it. Sure.
Agent: By [DATE-48] or?
Agent: Yeah, [DATE-41] is fine.
EndUser: Yeah, [DATE-41] or you. Yeah.
Agent: Just just I mean, we just want some baseline averages and then we can go from there.
Agent: Overall traffic or unique?
EndUser: Actually, both if you have it, overall would be helpful, but unique would be helpful, if all to. Okay, yeah, it.
Agent: I can get that.
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-26]. I appreciate This was great.
EndUser: Thank you guys so much.
Agent: I was
EndUser: Good talking
EndUser: To you guys and we look forward to talking to you again soon.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer to this question is unclear. The customer did express interest in the product, particularly for existing guests, and saw potential use cases for it. However, they also mentioned that their plate is full and that approving the product would require a very compelling use case due to strict goals and guidelines. They asked for a preliminary understanding of the pricing, but this does not necessarily indicate that they feel the product meets their needs. It could be a part of their due diligence process.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if there were opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers' needs. The sales rep does ask several questions to understand the customers' needs and use cases, but it is not clear if more time should have been spent on this.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the personalization capabilities of the seller's product, particularly in terms of its potential impact on their existing customers. They mentioned that the tool could help them recognize and respond to existing customers' behavior on their website, such as by triggering personalized email or SMS campaigns or alerts to sales personnel. The customer also mentioned that they were interested in using the tool to enhance their lease retention efforts. However, they were less interested in the tool's capabilities for tracking anonymous users, and expressed a preference for focusing on known users in a potential demonstration. Overall, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product could help them better understand and engage with their existing customers, which they saw as a key priority.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"The customer expressed several concerns that could potentially prevent the deal from closing:

1. Current plate being extremely full: The customer mentioned that their plate is full, and they have a lot of ongoing initiatives. This could indicate that they might not have the bandwidth to implement and utilize the seller's product immediately.
2. Prioritization: The customer stated that the personalization aspect of the product is more interesting to them than the anonymous side. They also mentioned that they would prioritize this product after their current priorities. This shows that the deal might not be a high priority for the customer at the moment.
3. Approval process: The customer mentioned that getting approval for additional funding would be a big sell, especially since they have strict goals and guidelines. This could indicate that the approval process might be lengthy and challenging.
4. Timing: The customer was clear that they did not want to rush the approval process or implementation due to their current priorities. They also mentioned that implementing the product might not start immediately even if they approve it during the fiscal year.
5. Resource allocation: The customer expressed concerns about resource allocation for implementing the product. They want to ensure they have the necessary resources to effectively utilize the product.

These concerns suggest that the deal might face challenges related to timing, prioritization, approval, resource allocation, and the customer's current workload.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1. ""What's top of mind for you guys?""

The customer showed more engagement after this question as they acknowledged the value of personalization in achieving their goals.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have done a better job summarizing the agenda and setting clear expectations for the discussion. This would have helped to focus the conversation and ensure that all participants were on the same page.
2. The sales rep could have provided more concrete examples of how the seller's product has helped other customers in the automotive industry. This would have helped to illustrate the value of the product and make it more relatable to the customer's business.

They mentioned that they had started to explore tools for website tracking and personalized data based on that tracking. However, they had feedback that the data from the vendor they were testing was somewhat questionable. They also wanted to understand more about the initial use cases that the seller had in mind for their product.

Additionally, the customer had concerns about the timing of the project, as they were busy with other initiatives and had a lot on their plate. They also mentioned that there were specific goals and guidelines that they had to meet, and any new software approval would have to be a very compelling use case for them to talk with their CFO about funding.

Speaker 10: Alright, everybody able to see the salesforce demonstration screen?
EndUser: Yeah, yes, yes.
Speaker 10: Perfect. I've got it on a second monitor. I'll be going back and forth with how my eyes are looking. So don't get too distracted with that.
Speaker 10: But we're excited to show you what salesforce can do per [ORG-1] properties [DATE-1]. We appreciate everyone taking the time to meet with us. And we're going to jump right into it. So we got a good amount to cover.
Speaker 10: So this is a forward looking statement slide. This is a part of every [ORG-2] presentation. Everything that we're going to cover [DATE-1] is readily available in [ORG-2] now. It's been available for a while as well.
Speaker 10: But should we encounter anything?
Speaker 10: Whether [DATE-1] or down the road that might be on a roadmap and not a readily available feature of [ORG-2]. This is just saying make your decisions based on what's available now.
Speaker 10: This really gives us the ability to pivot based on market conditions.
Speaker 10: So the agenda for [DATE-1]'s discussion will go over some introductions on our side. We've met some of the folks and then of course with LinkedIn and everything else. We kind of gotten to know you also.
Speaker 10: We don't want to spend a whole lot of time on the introduction side, We'll give a little bit of an overview of [ORG-2] as well. We'll hop into the demonstration.
Speaker 10: The reason we're all here, then we'll have some Q&A in next steps. But with that said, thank you.
Speaker 10: We'll see at the end here, but [PERSON-1] and a few others on the team have already spent a good amount of time with us, really giving us an overview of the use case for [ORG-2] at [ORG-1] properties, some of the technical requirements.
Speaker 10: [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] were fantastic at [LAW-1] as kind of figuring out your current processes as they relate [DATE-1].
Speaker 10: And we've taken all that information and compiled it together along with the requirements that were provided to us and really tried to make this demonstration as relevant as possible for you.
Speaker 10: So thank you for the time that you've invested thus far. as well as the time that you're investing [DATE-1] to meet with us We really appreciate it . So this is your [ORG-2] team.
Speaker 10: I'm the one talking, your [ORG-2] and [GPE-1] my team, I should say. So for those of you that I have not met, [PERSON-4], I am the Account Executive from [ORG-2]. It's responsible for our overall relationship.
Speaker 10: With [ORG-1] property, so nice to meet you. Then I'll let [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] introduce themselves, and we'll do [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-8] and jump into it.
Agent: All right. Hi everybody. My name is [PERSON-9], a Senior Solutions Engineer at [ORG-2].
Agent: I'm basically [PERSON-10]'s counterpart when it comes down to technical discovery, as well as demonstrations, been at [ORG-2] for [DATE-2], been doing solutioning for [DATE-3].
Agent: Nice to meet you all and excited to present to you [DATE-1].
Agent: Hi all nice to meet you. My name is [PERSON-13]. I'm part of [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-5]'s team here on the, and I support the business development side of the team.
EndUser: Good [TIME-1] everyone. My name is [PERSON-11]. I am with the [NORP-1] team. So we help support everything that [ORG-2] does from an Implementation standpoint. I'm the senior account executive.
EndUser: So you will be hopefully hearing from me in the future to coordinate all of these fun meetings that we have and that we're heartbroken if we have to miss.
Agent: And then I'm [PERSON-10], also in the [NORP-1] team. You know, as [PERSON-7] said, you know, we partner with [ORG-2] across the board, but we really specialize in partnering with real estate.
Agent: And my background has been, you know, spending my career consulting and working in industry for a few different firms, worked at [GPE-2] retail for [DATE-4].
Agent: So very intubally familiar with retail malls and how we can help with the leasing processes. I'm excited to be here [DATE-1].
Speaker 10: Perfect. So I know [ORG-2] might be new to several of you that are on the call [DATE-1].
Speaker 10: So one of the things we always like to discuss first when talking about [ORG-2] is our core values, is they really guide everything we do.
Speaker 10: In top of the list is trust, right?
Speaker 10: It's our number one value. And it really means that we act with transparency and lead with our ethics. Then we have customer success. With our customers aren't successful, we are not successful.
Speaker 10: So we prioritize our customer success and thus the success of your customers or tenants or future tenants. And also innovation.
Speaker 10: We want our products to be the most relevant, easy to use, integratable and global products out there that have a really, really fast time to value for our customers. inequality.
Speaker 10: We believe that everything is better when we're all working together, going in the same direction. And sustainability, that's a new one for us as of [DATE-5].
Speaker 10: I saw on your website that that's a big part of what y'all do as well. But everything rests on a stable climate. So we're helping every organization achieve net zero and leading by example as a net zero company.
Speaker 10: So that sales force in our core values.
Speaker 10: And then we have our, I don't know, [ORG-3] slide, if you want to call it that, I'm not sure what you want to call about, but this really shows [ORG-2] market share versus our top four competitors and really the reason I show this is not to be.
Speaker 10: Boisterous or brag on [ORG-2]. I'm very proud to work here, but it's our customers that have put us in this position and continue to do so.
Speaker 10: Without them and their success, they wouldn't choose [ORG-2], it wouldn't give us the ability to become number one and continue the gap that we have. So we're very proud of that due to that.
Agent: Sorry. And then, you know, [PERSON-10] just kind of led you through [ORG-2]'s core values and, you know, kind of their beliefs. [PERSON-19] very much a industry-led firm.
Agent: So I just love to flash up some of the folks that we work with. These are all [ORG-2] partners as well. They're, you know, organizations that have really figured out how to get the value out of this platform.
Agent: And so we try to reference these as much as possible with stories on our website references, things like that. Just want to call out that we're an industry-led group that loves to help real estate.
Speaker 10: Perfect. And with that, we've made it to the demonstration. The reason we're all here. So let's show you what [ORG-2] looks like.
Speaker 10: And we're going to [PERSON-5] will take the wheel and go over everything as it relates to [ORG-2] here.
Speaker 10: But we'll show you what it looks like from a leasing agent perspective, as well as from a VP perspective, kind of how your day-to-day goes. And feel free, we want this to be collaborative.
Speaker 10: So if you have any questions, mid-demo, feel free to chime in. We want this to be interactive and we're here to make sure that you have a solid understanding of how [ORG-2] can benefit [ORG-1] properties.
Agent: Before I get started, are there any questions this far?
Agent: Feel free to ask.
Agent: All right. So like [PERSON-10] said, demonstration [DATE-1] will be framed through the experience of a leasing agent, so especially leasing in this case for [PERSON-11].
Agent: It doesn't have to be limited to specialty could be also a perm and we could talk about how like that variance can happen later on the presentation but from a demonstration standpoint I'm going to focus on specialty more so.
Agent: The customer is going to be [PERSON-19] she's going to be an event coordinator for an organization for the [PERSON-14] small, I believe that's small that you all often use as an example in [LOC-1] So we asked like which was the best one in terms of property to use and so w e that was what was given to us and so that's how we're going to go through the demonstration as well .
Agent: All right.
Agent: Can everybody see my screen okay?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: All right, so the first thing going in through the lens of [PERSON-10], the first thing that I'm going to do typically throughout my day is check my email. Right.
Agent: So the first thing I see is that [PERSON-19] has set through an email for the [ORG-1] team and she's interested in leasing for holiday events. She's a representative of sketches.
Agent: She wants to lease out a specific area within the [PERSON-14] play small in order for her holiday about for sketches. So that's kind of the example that we went through. Again, for demonstration. purposes.
Agent: And a [ORG-2] panel. So there are a number of ways that you can actually log like emails directly into [ORG-2].
Agent: We have a bidirectional sync with Outlook, which means that emails can go directly into [ORG-2] as well as back into Outlook.
Agent: What's happening here that I have in the right hand panel is that I have a manual log button. That doesn't always have to be the case. We can set up [FAC-1], which is automated.
Agent: So every email would be captured and linked based on the records that you have on the email. email address.
Agent: It'll directly link into the record for [ORG-2] and I'll show you wha t that looks like when we get into the platform itself .
Agent: Just wanted to note that a lot of the components within [ORG-2], you can access within this panel and Outlook too. Say I wanted to create a task, activity, a new account.
Agent: I can actually do all that within the panel itself as well.
Agent: Does it slow me down and actually adds to my productivity as I'm going through the platform?
Agent: Any questions regarding this?
Agent: Does this look in-act similar if you're in the desktop version of it?
Agent: Yes, so how I'm doing it is I'm actually going through the browser. It's just an add on. You can add it onto the desktop version as well. So it would just be slightly, it's the same component.
Agent: You're going to have all the same stuff and all the abilities to edit and change whatever is visible on the panel itself. It's just a little bit different in terms of how you're adding it in.
Speaker 10: Yeah, [PERSON-1], prior to coming to [ORG-2], I used [ORG-2] in an outlook, actual application versus the web browser.
Speaker 10: And kind of like where you see print, discover groups, it was just a tab like that, and you could expand it or contract it that way it didn't take up some of your screen if you didn't want it to.
Speaker 10: But yeah, it works just the same.
Agent: So after [PERSON-23] responds to the email, [PERSON-20] actually looks through and goes through her existing inbox, she actually wants to go into the [ORG-2] platform itself. So with her credentials, she logs into [ORG-2] as a whole.
Agent: So I'm going to show the actual login portion of it because it's just username and password. There wasn't asked about SSL, which can be done.
Agent: So you can do SSL logins as well as we have two-factor authentication that is required.
Agent: So there's a lot of security that goes about getting into your instance as well as the right user is accessing the platform correctly And so there's a lot of security on that too So the first thing is first, [PERSON-10], she logs into [ORG-2] with her credentials.
Agent: She's able to see right at our homepage some information, right This is all to help her prioritize her day as well as understand her overall performance So there's a lot right now, so I'm going to go through each component and then you can ask any questions if you have any questions right?
Agent: So what I'm seeing right in front on the left hand side, you see this leasing dashboard is for individual reps. This is for [PERSON-10] specifically. These are all dashboards that are created based off reports.
Agent: And that report those reports. I'll go into more detail on how you can edit and create the m.
Agent: Off of information that's existent within [ORG-2] platform.
Agent: So all of these are representations for [PERSON-10] to understand, hey, what least is this you have executed, what's overall pipeline look like, what's the forecast look like?
Agent: We can also gamify and have a leaderboard for, say, all their sales reps and see how they're performing as well. So all this is just to help her understand her. priority as well as her overall performance.
Agent: Another component on the right hand side that's able to help her understand her priority is looking at the tasks that she has available. So tasks are, again, a to-do list for [PERSON-10] specifically. She can create tasks for herself.
Agent: Other members of the team can create tasks for her, as well as she can create tasks for other people as well. So this is all basically what she has to do [DATE-1]. And it's his priority and set.
Agent: Specifically in front of her on our home page so she can ask us it really quickly Another component is the ability to look at [DATE-1]'s events.
Agent: So these are say calls or meetings o r dinners that are scheduled based off of your Outlook calendar and brought over into events a s well. So you can have multiple places to see the same information .
Agent: Now, before I move on, the homepage, this is specific to [PERSON-10]. So you can have, you know, dashboards that are relevant to specific profile types.
Agent: So if there is a leader, say, interface for homepage, the dashboards can be different. The components can be different. So all of these square boxes, we can remove them. We can change them. We can edit them.
Agent: They can be different for each type of role that's within the organization.
Agent: Any questions as far?
Agent: All right, so as [PERSON-10] looks through, she does have a meeting with [PERSON-26]. She had that email come through. She wants to actually go in and take a look a little bit more at [PERSON-19].
Agent: She is currently right now a lead, so she's going to take a look at the lead record for her and navigate directly to the lead itself.
Agent: But before I do that, actually, I want to take a look at my overall leads. I can actually do that by just going into the lead object right here and seeing all of this in a related list feed.
Agent: So what we call this is a regulated list. It's because there are a number of different records as we call it. So say [PERSON-19] has a lead is a record. She's fitting into this list view.
Agent: And she has a whole, [PERSON-10] has a whole list of multiple records within a specific view. What I can do here at [PERSON-10]'s, I can also look at my leads, but I can look at all leads.
Agent: I can have multiple different types of lists, and I can have it filtered in any specific way. Right now, these are filtered under my leads and a specific lead type.
Agent: So I can see, okay, this is what's important for me and what I wanna get through day to day. What I can also do is I can edit, inline, and change the information around the record directly here.
Agent: Within the platform itself, I can also what was asked before change the owner. So right now [PERSON-10], I'm [PERSON-10], so I'm owning this specific, these specific leads.
Agent: But if I wanted to change one or more to a different user because I'm going to be out or even if an executive was to change the specific leads owner to someone else, that can all be done within this view very easily.
Agent: You can do it within the record itself, but you could do multiple here. So I think that's an important point to call out as I know there,
Speaker 10: Whether it be through promotions or people moving on to other opportunities, you do have a decent amount of turnover, especially on the specialty leasing side.
Speaker 10: So if you have someone that leaves and they have 10 leads, instead of individually going, pointing and clicking and moving those leads to different owners, if you want to split them up between three people, then you can just Click the ones that you want to go to [PERSON-26], say, and then change the owner that way.
Speaker 10: So it's not having to go through one at a time. You can select as many as you want and kind of batch and move them.
Agent: Absolutely. And again, all these different columns are basically just there are fields within the record itself. So I'll show you how that looks like an actual record page in a little bit.
Agent: But you could display anything you would like here. So I have it based off of what we've gathered in terms of the information, the owner itself, the priority of the lead, as well as the lead source.
Agent: So having all that as well as the stage of the lead, having all that.
Agent: Is very effective for me to figure out okay, what do I have to handle next right so if I sort by priority?
Agent: I can see that [PERSON-26] is one of the high priorities. I can actually dive into the record itself Any questions as far
Agent: Is there any confusion with what i'm showcasing here [DATE-1]?
Agent: Is this something new that you know folks on the line have never seen before, or is it something that you've seen in the past?
EndUser: I think using is very intuitive. I don't know that we've seen it exactly in the past, but I mean, this is great. So thank you.
Agent: Awesome.
Agent: So I guess just real quick, then [PERSON-2], so it sounds like this way of managing leads resonates kind of with some of your existing processes.
Agent: Is that fair?
EndUser: It looks very much like a spreadsheet. It doesn't look like a sticky note, but it does look like a spreadsheet, so very comfortable. Great.
Agent: So I'm going to dive right back into the demonstration itself. Now I'm going to actually navigate to what we call a record, which is just the storage of all of [ORG-4] information. So here's the record.
Agent: And so going back to what was showcased to us during the reverse demo and some of the conversations we had during discovery, there's a lot of information around, hey, we have a lot in [PRODUCT-1] right now, how do we bring that into a platform like [ORG-2]?
Agent: So what I'm showcasing right now is the concept or an architect.
Agent: Of [ORG-2] is that, hey, we have an object, which is basically leads So all leads, that's your typical [PRODUCT-1] table, right And then you have Content like lead information, name, title specifically category, any relationships that they have in terms of what account it is .
Agent: And or say, lead referral, all of that is like [PRODUCT-2] that you typically have an [PRODUCT-1] like rose as well as columns. That would be stored within a record within [ORG-2].
Agent: So like, if you're translating from an [PRODUCT-1] document, you can have everything that you have in your [PRODUCT-1] document within [ORG-2]. And it'll be, it could be done one two one.
Agent: Now, we could do even more complex pieces where you're saying, Hey, I can, I want to put it in a formula field, for instance, right?
Agent: So all these are fields. I can edit them, but I can put it in a formula field. formula field and I want to aggregate some information I can do that as well .
Agent: But before I get too deep into the details piece, I'm going to go over just high level what you're looking at right now.
Agent: So top of the page is just general information that [PERSON-10] might need to make for [PERSON-26].
Agent: And then below that, you have this [ORG-5] that we typically like to look at, which is like your dominoes pizza tracker in terms of the stages of interacting with the lead.
Agent: And I'll explain a little bit further as we go through the demonstration of what that looks like when you're going to have conversion from a lead to an opportunity contact and account.
Agent: That I'll showcase that in a little bit. But what's helpful here is that [PERSON-26] as a rep can easily go through the different specific stages.
Agent: And understand what she has to do So for [DATE-6], she sees the guidance for succes s that's underneath the specific share o n that tells her what to do and what to do next .
Agent: If it's unqualified, she can easily just set it as unqualified. It will be removed from certain pipeline reports as well as information.
Agent: But if she continues working, there's another set of guidance or success that sits underneath and tells her what to do next.
Agent: So this is how you would kind of go through the Workflow of qualifying a specific lead and then moving them over into and converting them to an opportunity at a later stage.
Agent: Does that?
Agent: And also I know one of the things that was important was being able to determine the source of that lead. Mm-hmm. And so that's where we're getting into the details of the information itself.
Agent: So whether it be a specific category that you might be able to mark or pull the data in from, say I have a set for scholarly events, but there was mentioned for pop-ups, expose.
Agent: You can kind of categorize and customize the fields here, however you like.
Agent: And add whatever makes the most sense for your business as a whole, but also referral and lead sources, they can all come through a different methodology as well in terms of segmentation.
EndUser: So we can customize not just the values for the fields, but the fields that are included themselves. Correct. Everything here is configurable.
EndUser: Does that help?
Agent: So before I move on, I'm wanted to touch on the aspect of how you can actually engage with marketing.
Agent: So there is, we didn't do that much discovery around marketing aspects of it, but I didn't want to touch on this. There is the ability to add, say, [PERSON-26] to a marketing campaign.
Agent: So she can have campaign history as well as marketing journeys.
Agent: It's all connected, right?
Agent: So if you want that information to be stored in here and visualized for someone like [PERSON-10], she can easily access. and see this information as well.
Agent: And I would just add quickly. I think a cool way I've seen campaigns used in the past for specialties, like the rest being around even [DATE-7] right now.
Agent: You can just start to aggregate leads around what they happen to be interested in, what they're going for, sometimes just organizing those campaigns helps the teams collaborate better.
EndUser: Great. I have a quick question. On the guidance for success. It looks like importance of qualifying your lead. Is that a is that just a different color or is that a link that goes somewhere.
Agent: So it can be done in multiple ways. This for demo purposes is highlighted, and it is a redirect link, but it's not going to go to anything in particular.
Agent: But yeah, you can set specific links or Knowledge Articles or specific components in which you can redirect the user to see, hey, maybe I have a checklist that I have to go through, specifically.
Agent: You can link all that as well.
Agent: So would that link to something in [ORG-2]?
Agent: So would it like?
Agent: A [ORG-6] . It could be either or. OK. So I think it really depends on your use case.
Agent: And that's [PERSON-8] and the team is able to help you scope that out in the future in terms of setting it up.
Agent: Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, without going too deeply. So this is a kind of a cool opportunity as well to just create consistency for new folks in terms of process training.
Agent: You know, we can create links out to document repositories, checklists as [PERSON-5] was kind of saying, think of this as your way of helping folks get up to speed quicker, but also just having consistency and process and Workflow in the long term.
EndUser: Yeah, this is great. I just, I love it. Thank you.
EndUser: Very helpful for turnover.
Agent: Very much.
Agent: Now to continue on again, like I mentioned earlier, right?
Agent: Everything here is configurable. So I can remove these components. You can add different fields. You can change the field itself. You can change the Content of the field. You can change all the tabs up here.
Agent: This is again what [PERSON-8] and team is going to help with in terms of scoping as well as implementing what makes the most sense for you.
Agent: I do want to touch on the activities piece, which is saying any communication and engagement. So all of those emails that are sent to [PERSON-26], they'll actually all be stored. under the activity.
Agent: So you see my response to [PERSON-26] as well as her actual initial email.
Agent: All that is stored under the activity feed within [ORG-2] underneath her record so that if I, you know, had to transfer this over to another individual to help support.
Agent: They can actually just look at all the engagement history and see what they're calm where the conversation has been. Where are we at now it's very easy to get up to date right.
Agent: I can also email directly out from here. I can also see any tasks that are related. and events that are related, tasks that are overdue, all listed underneath this kind of activity dashboard .
Agent: Or activity component within the record itself. And this, again, translates throughout the process of actually converting, qualifying this lead, and moving it on to the next stage.
Agent: Any questions there?
Agent: Yeah, so the benefit of having all the activities underneath here is that once you have all this information, certain salesforce, we'll get into how reporting looks, but it gives you a lot of advantages, right, to be able to report out on, hey, like, what's the engagement?
Agent: How many times have we engaged with this individual?
Agent: What's the likelihood for them to actually lease with us?
Agent: Like, a lot of those things can be done once you have all this information kind of stored in one location.
Agent: So before I actually convert this to an opportunity, I did want to touch on chatter, which is the collaboration tool that we have within [ORG-2] itself.
Agent: So we can actually at an individual, in this case, so if he is manager, that's at [PERSON-23] and mentioned, Hey, I need help with this specifically.
Agent: Can you jump in, right?
Agent: And if I share this, it will notify my manager, [PERSON-23], that there has been a post, and the post will be tracked, and it will allow us to collaborate on the specific record itself.
EndUser: So I want to touch on that piece as well. There was an ask for the at mention, as well as ability to collaborate within the record, and that's kind of how we would do it within [ORG-2].
EndUser: So how does that show up on [PERSON-23]'s side?
EndUser: Is that an answer?
Agent: Activity that's going to show up on his dashboard. Yeah, so for the post itself, what'll happen is there could be a notification that's listed up here when they're in the platform.
Agent: Or if you, depending on the setup, you could have it send an email notification that says, hey, within [PERSON-23]'s inbox, it'll say, hey, like you have a post directly from [PERSON-10], make sure you will be.
Agent: So there's a number of ways to set up the notification. It really depends on how you want to
EndUser: Notify that user.
Speaker 10: Yeah, the way we do it here at [ORG-2] is so we get the notification on the bell so it'll let us know real-time that that's happened and then we also get that email sent.
Speaker 10: It has a direct link to it that way you can like it, comment really do whatever is needed in order to satisfy the request that comes through.
EndUser: Perfect.
EndUser: And then the chatter stays with this lead.
Agent: Correct. Forever. Yeah, so it'll be stored within the record itself. There is like, we could talk about it at a later state. There is stuff about archiving the data, but we don't have to cover that now.
Agent: What will happen as well as this information will, once you're converting it over, it'll also populate, right?
Agent: So what we typically suggest in terms of a sales process is that you have your lead qualification, and then once, Revenue is decided to be associated with a specific record.
Agent: We can convert the lead over and there's another set of stages for the opportunity. So if I'm converting this, I would actually convert it to now an account, contact, and opportunity.
Agent: So opportunity is going to sort that specific opportunity for that user. Account is going to be sketchy in this case, which is the organization that the contact is working for. And then the contact would be [PERSON-19].
Agent: So they would be three separate records, technically, but they would be all associated together. This is the best way to track as well as organize the information that we've seen in industry.
Agent: And it's, you know, how we kind of structured it from a sales process wise and how most people handle it.
Agent: Can there be multiple opportunities per lead?
Agent: Yes.
Agent: That's like the reason, right?
Agent: So a lot of the times, like you're going to have multiple opportunities or multiple contacts under each account, right?
Agent: So I'll get into it once we got the opportunity itself. So say, you know, I converted over.
Agent: Now we have this opportunity, you know, different stages again, and you can again have different level, different guidance for success for each one, if you want. Um, but this is to help.
Agent: A leasing agent kind of go through the different stages that she needs to approach in order to close the business and make sure the lease is signed, as well as I know there's like an approval process that needs to happen sometimes.
Agent: And what was discussed was that sometimes, you know, the negotiations happened before the approval is approved.
Agent: And like, there's a number of ways that we can accommodate for that, but I'll talk to that as we go through the at different stages for what [PERSON-10] can do.
Agent: So the first thing I do want to mention is that all this information around activity, chatter, all of that record information around like lead referrals, all that can transfer over to the opportunity as well.
Agent: So that can be stored and existence. You're not copying information over, you're not having to re-input it, all of it's actually just stored and then moved over. So now you have it all in one location as well.
Agent: For the different stages here, this could be dependent on your process overall. You can change this however you like. So say you have five stages instead of how many I have here or you have a lot more.
Agent: You can actually change that however you like, add as many stages as you want, add as many guidance to success as you want as well.
Agent: Now the one thing I did want to know is that, If there is an approved process that you do have, right?
Agent: So say I set it to approval before I'm getting any lease signed or doing any negotiations, there might be an approval needed. This will actually.
Agent: Stop or stall the actual record itself and wait for a manager and or executive to approve the process. So you can actually put in an approval process and this will notify say [PERSON-23] in this case.
Agent: Hey, I need approval for this opportunity making sure all information is accurate. It's within our margins. Once that's approved, then they can move on to the lease signing process.
Agent: So there is a whole approval process that can be built in here so that there is no like back and forth or there's just overall more consistency. Any questions so far.
Agent: And at least so before you had talked about a few of the approvals, you know, not always necessarily happening at the perfect timing does do you think something like this helps address that.
EndUser: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
Agent: Great. I was going to say some groups do some really nice setups where they basically have this process auto populate the deal sheet for you more or less. So then it can feed super seamlessly into that approval process.
Agent: That would be wonderful. I have tears in my eyes.
Agent: All right, so now that you know we've gone through the high level opportunity that's going to what else is actually created underneath that.
Agent: So you have the account information right so we again have sketches right this might be an existing account already. And so what I want to look at is what's related underneath there. So I have the related context.
Agent: This is [PERSON-26] the contact that's associated with who we're speaking to on a regular basis.
Agent: You can't have multiple contacts here, right?
Agent: There might be other coordinators, executives, and or anything else that you can store all related to the kind of itself.
Agent: The opportunity is the sketch your holiday event, but you see that once I actually converted over, I had a Workflow in the background actually immediately create this renewal that is for the same time, but [DATE-8].
Agent: So I can have something like that in terms of Workflow actually automatically done.
Agent: So whether we pay our I want to trigger a task or I want to trigger a creation of a new opportunity to make sur e that the renewal happens [DATE-9], that can all be done, right We can actually automate that entire process so that nothing gets left and slips throug h the cracks .
Agent: Again, I see the account team here. You see the manager and you see [PERSON-10]. You can have all that kind of information stored in one location.
Agent: Questions as far?
Agent: All right. Again, just touching on the contact itself, being able to see all the information here, reaching out to them if I want to.
Agent: But I want to go back to the actual opportunity of 10 and look at the property that they're actually engaging with. And they're actually engaging with hands in place here, which is what it's related to.
Agent: And I'm seeing all this information based on the property itself as well.
Agent: So what I do want to touch on is that they're [TIME-2]. I do want to touch on the information that's available for the property itself. It could be say, this is more advanced.
Agent: So say you want to look at what units are available for the property, you can have a kind of broken down like this, as well as a rental bull area, if it's vacant, if there is a tenant moving in.
Agent: I know this is my view, like bridging the gap between perm and specialty, but you can also use this from the specialty standpoint as well. Yeah, move and move out.
Agent: So you might have individuals that are still moving in their own preparation, different stages. There might be.
Agent: Delayed in terms of moving out or taking down specific pieces, you can have all that kind o f listed out underneath the property itself .
Agent: And lastly, of course, if you want to attach say like a site plan, so this is both from [FAC-2] small site, you can have the site plan either attached in this case, underneath the [FAC-3] record and or we can get way more complex with it, but just to want to know that you could have all that information located in one location.
Agent: For the property itself.
Agent: How does this fare this far with what I've shown you all?
Agent: Is there any overall feedback?
Agent: You love it?
Agent: Does it hit everything that you're asking for?
EndUser: This is great. So as you're talking, I'm thinking, okay, I'm in love,
Agent: How are the teams in a real life scenario?
EndUser: So right now we're looking at one lead, which is [PERSON-26]. But on [DATE-10], an agent could be working with 25 people.
EndUser: And I know like the more tabs you get, the more stuff, you know, windows that are open, it can get overwhelming.
EndUser: So I mean, what does that look like?
EndUser: If I was working 10 things at the same time, or can I even do that?
Agent: Yeah, you definitely can, but I would say it really depends on how you want to manage the workflow. There's a number of ways to handle this.
Agent: Generally speaking, as an individual leasing agent, you're going to be primarily working on one person. You're going to have one engagement at a time. You can't have multiple engagements throughout [DATE-13].
Agent: Like you're going to probably be speaking with more than five two 10 people a day or even more than that.
Agent: But from a one-on-one perspective, if at this time I'm engaging with this user, I'm only going to be engaging with them. So generally speaking, you would have one record available.
Agent: And then there can be automation set in place to say notify of any tasks that have to be done and or any response that have to be given. And so.
Agent: That could be done through tasks, which is what I have listed out on the home page itself . here and or you can still have the different lead records available.
Agent: There's more complicated ways that we can handle it, but we wanted to keep it as simple as possible in terms of demonstration [DATE-1] to show you like, hey, the power of the platform itself.
Agent: But I'd love, [PERSON-8], do you want to jump in here and talk a little bit about
Agent: What they do in terms of managing?
Agent: Yeah, I know it was about to. I think what's cool about this piece is we can design it to be what is most useful for your team.
Agent: To your point, [PERSON-2], I think we always want to avoid too many screens open, too many things like that. And so we typically recommend that folks use tasks or that they work from a lead list.
Agent: Then you can very easily see who you've contacted most recently. You can switch from lead to lead very easily. Say, for example, [PERSON-2] said maybe 10 on any given day.
Agent: Maybe you are contacting all of these people on any given day. That would not be surprising by any way, shape. form.
Agent: So this is where we could bring up columns of the most recent activity, help you easily sor t through those. It truly doesn't become overwhelming when you're doing it because it's what the platfor m is designed to do.
Agent: But it's a combination of tools if that's helpful.
Agent: Does that answer you r question [PERSON-2] ?
Agent: Yes, thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 10: And then if someone were to call in, you click on the search bar, type their name in, pop it up, and then you bring out this record right here and automatically work from it.
Agent: Yeah, it's amazing how in practicality that, you know, an interpre-university search bar gets used quite frequently because it helps you find everything immediately.
Agent: So anything that pops up on the fly, most folks are popping there very quickly, and then going to their task lists and their lead lists. And basically with those three things, you have everything.
Agent: So the last component I want to touch on after the actual overall process of handling the lead and taking a declosure, say this, you know, [PERSON-26] here does actually end up closing a lease with.
Agent: The [ORG-1] team for that specific event. Now let's take a look at how dashboard and reporting works. This is more for an executive and or manager. We're looking at the overall organization as a whole.
Agent: Like I mentioned in the beginning, you can take a look at The dashboards and these are all created based off of reports.
Agent: So this is more holistic to the organization looking at all the executed leases based on the goals that we had for [DATE-11].
Agent: And you can set up, you could set up to however, distinction that you might want in terms of the viewability as well as the filtering of it.
Agent: Looking at, again, leasing pipelines, the activity per rep, as well as the leaderboard for the reps as well. And additional reports can all be done.
Agent: Done based on what makes the most sense for understanding that outcome for each individua l rep, right ?
Agent: The dashboards report and showcase like what that report looks like. Right now the report will look like. See you soon.
Agent: Something similar to this is just like an [PRODUCT-1] output, essentially, of all the information. I can actually edit it very easily.
Agent: I can create a new report if I wanted to, but I wanted to show you a case how easy it is to create as well as edit the report.
Agent: It's fairly similar to what you would typically do with a pivot table in [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: You can add columns, rows, as well as filter. And so very easy to run that report and then add a chart and showcase exactly what the type of information you want is. And so...
Agent: So again, all this information is based off what's stored within [ORG-2], and that' s kind of how you're able to take advantage of the analytics as well as the data tha t you currently have for your business .
EndUser: So I'm assuming that there would be a way. So right now we use terms to kind of indicate where we think a deal is going to land. So we have executed, obviously that's a deal that's already secured.
EndUser: We have perspective, which is a deal that we're [PERCENT-1], sure is going to happen, or it's an upcoming renewal that we're comfortable will happen.
EndUser: And then we have perspective, which is, I don't know who I'm going to lease to, but I need to lease to someone to meet my budget. And that's... my that's that the speculative.
EndUser: So is there a way to kind of build that into the reporting so that we can kind of see
Agent: Yeah, so anything that you would want from a particular like record type. So what I'm showing you is a record.
Agent: We can do like different types of it as well as different fields for categorization, as well as this path that you have.
Agent: I think it really depends on the like scoping exactly what you need, right?
Agent: But overall, it's very, it's all very doable.
Agent: It's more so just like figure out, hey, what's the best Workflow for you in terms of having all that stored in one location, as well as where do you will want the user to kind of keep their eye on in terms o f being able to see where the priority is or where the stage is or where the status is for each individual piece.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Yeah, I was just going to add [PERSON-2], the short answer there is yes, for sure.
Agent: You're kind of referencing two different pieces ones or, you know, the type of deal that it is, but then two is the stage that the deal is in.
Agent: And those are by far the two most common ways that people report and check what's in their pipeline. So, you know, prospective deals of this type, boom, here's my list real fast.
Agent: So that's part of the upfront configuration that we would do with you throughout all of this is get the sequencing of how your deal stages flow basically and then connect those really tightly to the types.
Agent: And then you can find, you know, any specific.
Agent: Deal type that happens to be in that stage and you can filter on and find the information that yo u need and then you can work it or you can decide how much of a priority is or how likely it is o r adjust that type of thing .
EndUser: Perfect, thanks.
Agent: I know we have about, I believe, [TIME-3] left, right?
Agent: True. I wanted to make sure that we had some time left over.
Agent: Is there any questions as far?
Agent: Outside of what it was asked already. There's one last thing that didn't want to showcase really quick, and that's the ability to use everything or do everything that you saw on the app within the phone.
Agent: So it's mobile accessible. So everything that we were talking about in terms of the emails that have existed with [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-26], all that information is readily available in the application itself. I can do it on the go.
Agent: I can actually post in chatter. on top, I can add tasks, I can comment I can change the record itself . I can do all that within the mobile application. So I could do all that on the go.
Agent: So say I'm on site, I had a meeting, and I actually have to log that information. I want to store it somewhere. I can do it on my phone. So I want to touch on that.
Agent: I'll be back, too.
Agent: Now just add real quick [PERSON-5].
Agent: This is probably a good time to call out to a lot of folks then connect like a business card scanner or something like that so that you can actually then just natively cool give that a quick scan, then updates and creates either a new contact or creates whatever you wanted to create.
Agent: We see a lot of folks use that from the mobile setup as well just because you're walking around with it. As you meet people, you get handed a card, you can use your phone.
Agent: Absolutely.
EndUser: This also helps from an adoption standpoint, which I know is something that we discuss that it has to be adopted and it has to have ease of use.
EndUser: So that really helps combat any callouts with I was on site. I was walking them all. I'm going to sit down and log everything.
EndUser: It's all there for you live ready to go on our phones, which we live on already. So I found that that's been extremely helpful.
EndUser: Getting teams to log their things, use it effectively and really get the ROI that you're seeking.
Agent: Alrighty. And that's mainly what I wanted to showcase [DATE-1]. That pretty much ends the demonstration that we have.
Agent: Are there any questions that you might have for us right now before I hand it back to [PERSON-10]?
EndUser: I'm assuming we can, there's a way, like
Agent: If someone goes to our websites and fills out an application that could automatically feed into [ORG-2]. Yeah, absolutely. So I, again, didn't want to go that in depth in terms of what complications we can actually scope out.
Agent: [PERSON-8] and team can definitely help you with that, right?
Agent: We can do something as simple as, hey, there's a form fill on your site. That information that you fill into the form goes directly in the [ORG-2] is populated as a prospect or lead.
Agent: All that information is stored there. You can get as complicated as say, hey, I want to actually have an application on our site available to users to apply.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Like you can do all of that based on it just really depends on how you want to kind of approach it.
Agent: We would probably suggest like phasing it out to see like, hey, what's the easiest way to handle it right now. Maybe there's a face to face three later on, depending on how you want to structure.
Agent: You're onboarding as well as your change management. So.
EndUser: Does that help [PERSON-2]. Yes, thank you.
EndUser: Right. So I'm going to like our ability to, um, you know, send emails to say, like all the leads that are of a certain status or something like that.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: So we Yeah, you can do large, you could do like, you know, send email to all, right?
Agent: So we could definitely do like a list, a send list email to everybody. And it can be modified based on the macro within the email. So it'll take like the username specifically.
Agent: And then it'll be personalized to those individuals. If this is more of like a one on one off like engagement, if you're talking about more like mass communications and consistent journeys that you're going to put these individuals on.
Agent: We might talk to like say how you're doing marketing now, how can you kind of be more specific in terms of figuring out how the journey for that user should be But if you're just looking for like a one off hand, I want to engage in all of them and one go.
Agent: Yeah, I can easily send what is called list email . find a list, send all of them the same email, essentially, with personalized to their information.
Speaker 10: Does that one thing I do want to call out on this as well?
Speaker 10: So one of the filtering capabilities that we showed was at an [EVENT-1], was it Holiday?
Speaker 10: What are they here for?
Speaker 10: So you could filter based on [DATE-10].
Speaker 10: So if you're coming up on [DATE-19], it's [DATE-11], you want to make sure all your holiday contacts are You reach out to all your people that have had interests in having a holiday specialty leasing space within some of your malls, you can that rep can filter by that and add them to their own little personal campaign, then call it the holiday campaign, whatever they want it to be, and send emails via that route as well so you can filter based on a specific group of individuals within [ORG-2].
Speaker 10: And then add them to campaigns. It's one they'll manage themselves. So the Messaging and obviously you want it to be [ORG-1] approved messaging, but it's Messaging that they'll go about that way.
Speaker 10: It's not necessarily like corporate marketing, if that makes sense. Yeah.
EndUser: But. So that's that added campaign button up there that you could use. Through you do have the ability to kind of create marketing campaigns.
EndUser: So if we wanted to do that, could we?
Agent: Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely.
Agent: [PERSON-2], are you using anything for marking right now?
EndUser: I mean, to a degree, but again, a lot of our stuff is so manual. We have postcards that we hand out. We have all sorts of things that would be so much better if it was, you know, digital.
Agent: Yeah, and so there's definitely like more details that we could go into in terms of scoping that need, right?
Agent: For all intents and purposes, we can do everything.
Agent: Now it's more so dependent on like to what scale and what complication you want it to be, right?
Agent: There might be a need for our marketing solution, but based on what you're asking right now, like if you're just doing standard email and adding them to campaigns, you could very much do it with a core platform itself.
Agent: And again, I can let [PERSON-8] speak to it, but like it might be like a, once you understand like, and figure out how you're gonna use the platform now, you wanna take it the next step and advance the way you're handling your marketing, you can do that as well with the [ORG-2] platform.
Agent: Yeah, I would just add that I think [PERSON-2], a lot of folks coming from, you know, the solutions that you're on now would start with, you know, here's the, the basics six campaigns we would do throughout [DATE-19], something for everybody who does a pop up for [DATE-14], people who come in and do something for [DATE-10], people who are in for [DATE-23] for the carnivals we see in the parking lot, but you know pick all of those types of things that you can create standard Messaging to send out about it but then also to your point whether it's a postcard or a greeting or something like that, you could do campaigns to send that same consistent positive community-based Messaging as well.
Agent: So, think of it as pick the scenarios and then we ca n kind of orient it around that .
EndUser: And so I'm going to keep in mind there is that it will automatically, this might go without saying, but I just want to be as detailed as possible.
EndUser: It will then track all of that activity onto each individual contact.
EndUser: So you can see, did this person get an email from the campaign?
EndUser: And that can be something that you start baking into your analytics. You can pull reports on it.
EndUser: What did this campaign do for us?
EndUser: What kind of responses did we get?
EndUser: And that's all within the core platform. So it's not just that it can send the email. It then can also track how that email helped your organization.
EndUser: Afterwards, what kind of impact did it have?
EndUser: So that's something that is, hopefully, I think i s really relevant and important to note .
Speaker 10: Yeah, definitely. Very important. Thank you. Yeah, you can create templates and send an email to your employees saying, hey, holiday season is right around the corner.
Speaker 10: Use this template to contact your previous tenants that had interest in working with us over [DATE-7]. And then it's a template that you all have created. They click it, add the list to it and click send.
Speaker 10: Yeah, there you go.
EndUser: And this allows for quite a lot of records. You can see at the bottom it says send limits. So it gives you a lot of [PERSON-25] run without having to add anything extra.
Speaker 10: Perfect. Well, just a few more things to go over. I guess we'll pause real quick.
Speaker 10: Any questions as it relates to that?
Speaker 10: What we've discussed so far?
Speaker 10: Alrighty. So let me share my screen here.
Speaker 10: So a couple of things I wanted to touch on as I believe [PERSON-8] mentioned Like there is ways to add business card scanners to your mobile app. So [ORG-2] has an app exchange.
Speaker 10: Think of it much like the app store on your iPhone or [ORG-7]. If you have an Android device, you can just come up here and search. You can see my recent search, but business card scanner.
Speaker 10: And then it'll pop up. You can sort by ratings. You can sort by business needs, but vision, scan business card events. It's free. Just add it to your environment like that.
Speaker 10: So the only good thing about [ORG-2] is we're open API. Anybody that wants to work with us can work with us. Now we have a heavily vetting process for you to get on our app exchange.
Speaker 10: You can't just upload an app. Everything that is up there has been tested and approved by [ORG-2]. But this is something neat that you'll have in your back pocket too.
Speaker 10: And then the other thing I wanted to touch on is trailhead. [ORG-8] is a great learning environment, whether it be for new hires, whether it's for y'all, as you get up to speed, should you choose our solution.
Speaker 10: But it is literally a playground way of learning more about [ORG-2]. So if you can come up here and say, OK, how to create a sales report. Search for it.
Speaker 10: If my internet will work.
Speaker 10: There we go. And this will give you multiple different ways to learn about how to remake a port in [ORG-2]. So create report and dashboards for sales and marketing managers.
Speaker 10: You click into it and then you go through it. And after this, you'll be able to create reports and dashboards. And one thing I want to call out, this is completely free for anybody to use.
Speaker 10: And you can create your own trails, what we call them, which is a series of learnings, which is what this is.
Speaker 10: That way, if you have a new hire, you can say how to get started with [ORG-2] and just show specific things that you've curated or that you work with [PERSON-23] to help curate in one of these trails or projects.
Speaker 10: That way your new hires will be up to speed very quickly and be able to use the platform.
EndUser: So we can customize those by person or position. assign them out, schedule them throughout [DATE-19] as an example.
Speaker 10: You can't schedule them through within the platform. So this is separate from being within [ORG-2].
Speaker 10: Now you can send out like a company mandate and say, you need to have these trails done by X date and you can include the trail or project like this. You just copy the link and send it out.
Speaker 10: All you have to do to access any of this is just create a login.
EndUser: Thank you.
Speaker 10: Absolutely. All right, so let's jump back in the slide show here. To give you a quick example as well, like we use trails internally at [ORG-2] very often. So say I'm looking at, you know, we have regular security.
Agent: Trails that we have to do for any update in terms of our security processes and any like, you know, um, any type of learnings we use them internally as well.
Agent: So you could definitely use that as Part of your process how we train at [ORG-2]
EndUser: And we are right in salesforce just really quickly so we're not internal salesforce and we use them as well and they're great so
EndUser: Thank you
Speaker 10: So one thing I did want to touch on as it relates to sales force is We're really at the tip of the iceberg as far as it relates to what [ORG-2] can do to [ORG-1] properties.
Speaker 10: Everything we focused on here is this area right here. I'm not sure if you can see my mouse cursor, but deal in leasing management. There's so much more that [ORG-2] can do as a platform for your company.
Speaker 10: We wanted to be targeted and focus in on the use case here. But as you should you get started with [ORG-2], there's a whole other capability. It's like a complete target and reengage tenant section.
Speaker 10: This is our marketing side. It can be as in depth or as simple as you'd like it to be. Tenant and guest servicing from a servicing perspective. We have a whole area around that.
Speaker 10: Whether the integration, investment management, deal pipeline, sustainability, and ESG. There is a whole we call it the real estate 331 or customer 331. As you'll hear it kind of more generically announced from [ORG-2]. But.
Speaker 10: Your whole platform can be transitioned to [ORG-2].
Speaker 10: Should you choose?
Speaker 10: Should you want to just stick to deal and leasing management?
Speaker 10: That's completely fine. We're really just talking about the typically iceberg on how [ORG-2] can help [ORG-9].
Speaker 10: And to provide a little color on that, I'll turn that over to the [NORP-1] team on really what the long-term possibilities look like with [ORG-2].
Agent: Yeah, I just want to briefly kind of highlight this.
Agent: You know, I mean, as [PERSON-10] called out so many folks in real estate come to the sales force platform for that idea of, oh, I need a basic [PRODUCT-3] and I need to manage my leasing processes.
Agent: I would say it quickly becomes evident during some of the early scoping discussions that, oh, it can handle a lot that happens before leasing happens. And it can handle a lot that happens after leasing happens.
Agent: You know, one of the biggest questions we do during scoping is what as we're figuring out your entire deal lifecycle, people start to realize that. executed lease is really not the end of the deal.
Agent: It moves into the move-in process the property management process, which quickly moves into how do we interact with the tenan t long-term?
Agent: Maybe it's via a portal, and then suddenly we're doing service with tha t user as they can input some of that in the portal, and then that can interact wit h our property management group.
Agent: And then suddenly we have property management groups calling hey, can we start to track some of the asset data within there?
Agent: And the answer is yes And then even in the opposite direction, it's, yeah, we have leads coming in, but can we go bac k further?
Agent: A lot of the questions that came up [DATE-1] on that marketing side.
Agent: So, you know, what I put in front of you is just a call out that we spent a l ot of time talking in that top left hand corner.
Agent: But there really is the ability to cross t he entire lifecycle here, whether it's enhancing the leasing process itself, where a lot of folks create, you know, auto create documents for leases to speed themselves up.
Agent: They [PERSON-28] rt doing more automation in terms of rent schedules or commissions with outside brokers. Or, y ou know, [PERSON-2], as we talked about earlier, really automating the deal review process.
Agent: I've se en some grou p. that their deal review committees, they actually pull up a report in [ORG-2] and go through th at, which is very cool, because you see that data live.
Agent: And then just kind of touching on the bot [PERSON-38] is a big one that's become popular recently is folks are executing more and more complex leases or contracts on all types of leasing, and those move-in dates are becoming way more popular.
Agent: We're seeing lots of groups.
Agent: How can I project manage with tenant coordination, the move-in process or the move-out process and making sure that we actually adhere to the details of the lease?
Agent: Again, I won't drain every single detail here, but at least just wanted to talk about a bit of the art of the possible of how [ORG-2] can really become that operating platform holistically long-term.
Agent: You're starting exactly where you should though with leasing and the basics and keeping. it simple. We see it as a journey of adding these pieces on over time as it makes sense .
EndUser: Any questions there?
EndUser: I know a lot of information there.
EndUser: [PERSON-8], when you were talking about the piece of, you know, after the deal is signed, there are so many more steps to bring the deal to fruition and see it to its end.
EndUser: And whether they renew or they depart. All those steps over [DATE-20] or [DATE-26]. What section would that be in because it sounds like it would not be a capability within the area that we have been reviewing.
Agent: No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, it depends on exactly what you want. So for example, if it's a basic prompting for a lease renewal, that's super basic. Least gets executed.
Agent: We pull out the details of it, the details of that come back, and you store those within [ORG-2] as lease data, if you will. You could set up auto renewals. You could set up contacts.
Agent: All of that would be fairly basic setup that would be within the scope. More what I was just getting at is adding complexities and more cross-functional usage to the platform.
Agent: So for example, you would probably start with just your leasing teams in here to really get that cross functional platform You'd have to pull in property managers.
Agent: You'd have to pull in other marketing folks and get them access as well So it's not necessarily a limitation of functionality, more of a limitation of who has cross functional access to the system of that makes sense .
Agent: Was that helpful for your question?
EndUser: Oh, yes. Thank you.
Agent: The other piece I would call out though is, you know, some folks do start managing those dates within their anyways, even without, you know, giving access to property managers, there's things like that, as long as you have a point of contact with access who can manage those dates and push things forward.
Agent: We definitely encourage folks to think about it holistically, otherwise you're calling us in [DATE-26] and saying no one's abiding by the terms of my lease. Well, it's because we're not actually tracking them.
Agent: And it's typically a manifestation of a current problem as well, but you're just, you're able to actually see it way more quickly because of the system in front of you.
EndUser: So in our case here at [ORG-1], we execute our leases in our ERP, [PERSON-23]. What kind of integrations are interfaces
Agent: Do we have with [ORG-2] available [DATE-1], if any?
Agent: Oh, quite a few. We have built a lot of integrations with [ORG-10] during our career. That is obviously the most popular with [ORG-13]. We also do them with MRI, [PERSON-30].
Agent: Some folks do some really cool workflows where you generate the lease via [ORG-2], basically.
Agent: And then once it's actually inked and executed, you could run it through an abstraction software that then puts it in [ORG-10] and then we can integrate it back. Long story short, lots of possibilities with integrating into [ORG-2].
Agent: We know that a lot of the niche real estate tools like YARDI are not always super friendly.
Agent: In terms of integrating, but that's something that we've built a lot of perspective on And so depending upon how, I guess we'll even take a step back we know that not all yardy instances are created the same So based upon how your setup is actually set up we have some perspective on how to do that the best .
EndUser: And I'm guessing that also maybe includes ability to bring in data from [ORG-11] as far as I think I saw a screen earlier where we had the property details with the units and all that stuff.
EndUser: And does it also includes like things like that may enable us to synchronize our unit data that is in [ORG-11] with what we would find in self as well.
Agent: Yep, you got it. And so, you know, some of that is, we'll end up having some discussions of what exactly is your source of truth for certain pieces of data.
Agent: And then we can set up the integration so that they are making sure that they're actually synced across. So things like accounts, contact information, lease data, things like that, we actually make sure that it integrates through.
Agent: At least that's what we typically say.
EndUser: Sounds good.
Agent: Any other questions there?
Agent: I would just say the long story short here is that there's a lot of possibility in terms of taking on the holistic life cycle, but truly just honing in on, you know, deal workflows from a specialty and a perm standpoint a [PRODUCT-3] standpoint is huge in terms of pulling the organization together and creating some operational efficiencies.
Agent: I don't want to get off my numbers.
Agent: The one thing that I also wanted to note as well is that with [ORG-2], you have ownership of the platform.
Agent: So everything that I mentioned in terms of configuration as well as changes, that can be done within the platform itself and you own it, right?
Agent: So you can make it however you want. You don't need to come to us to make changes granted. You know, we have best practices and [PERSON-8] and team as well as us.
Agent: We can make those suggestions and we can help within it, like building specific components, but you don't have to come to us to make changes. And I think that's a big component as well.
Agent: But I'll hand it back to [PERSON-10] to talk about scheduling and the rest of it . Sure.
Speaker 10: Absolutely. Yeah, one of the best things about [ORG-2] is it can be customized to fit your business. You don't have to make your business fit your platform.
Speaker 10: So we always like to kind of point that out that whatever unique use cases you have, we've probably seen it before and we have a solution for it. So. We appreciate your time.
Speaker 10: I know we're [TIME-4] over right now. So thank you.
Speaker 10: This is just a little bit of a joint success plan that we put together here care and we can work backwards with you on this to fill it out.
Speaker 10: Should we continue and move forward, but we've already knocked out five of the items on here so that really concludes what we had planned for you [DATE-1]. So thank you very much.
Speaker 10: We'll send this presentation out as well as the Recording that way you have it. But.
Speaker 10: Any initial feedback or thoughts as it relates to what we presented [DATE-1]?
EndUser: No, I mean, I feel like we've pretty much covered the bases. No. Looks good.
Speaker 10: Was there anything that we didn't touch on [DATE-1] that you might want to see separately?
EndUser: I mean, I'll go through the list one more time, you know, in preparation for another round.
EndUser: We'll go through and just make sure, you know, because we're going to want to kind of retouch on all of those actual requirements anyway. So, but no, nothing off the top of my head that we didn't hit.
Speaker 10: Sounds great. Well, thank y'all very much for your time. [PERSON-23], I'll sync with you just separately after this. We can figure out, I know that you're going to see another demonstration of this.
Speaker 10: Just a little feedback from what we did [DATE-1]. That was part of what we had as a feedback, and then we'll work on scheduling the second round.
EndUser: Sounds good. Thanks, y'all.
Speaker 10: All righty. Thank you so much. We appreciate your time. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. [PERSON-38].",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of the seller's product to help manage leads and opportunities, as well as its ability to automate workflows and approvals. They also appreciated the customization options and the potential for the platform to handle the entire lifecycle of a deal, from lead generation to post-lease management. The customer was particularly interested in the ability to track and manage unit data, as well as the potential for integrations with their existing systems, such as [ORG-10], [PERSON-30], and [ORG-11]. They also mentioned the ease of use and the potential for the platform to improve operational efficiencies.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a comprehensive demonstration of the product and addressed many features that could potentially be useful for the customer. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. When discussing the core values of their organization, the sales rep mentioned sustainability and how it aligns with the customer's website. The rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's specific sustainability goals and initiatives, and how their product could support those efforts.

2. During the demonstration, the sales rep briefly mentioned the ability to customize the fields and values for leads. The rep could have asked the customer about their current lead tracking process and what specific data points they would like to capture in the system. This would have allowed the rep to tailor the demonstration to better fit the customer's needs.

3. When discussing the approval process, the sales rep mentioned that it could be customized to fit the customer's specific workflow. The rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current approval process and any pain points they experience. This would have allowed the rep to demonstrate how the product could streamline and improve this process.

4. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep briefly mentioned the ability to integrate with the customer's ERP system and bring in data from other sources. The rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current data sources and how they would like to see that data integrated into the system. This would have allowed the rep to demonstrate the full capabilities of the product and how it could be customized to fit the customer's specific needs.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did not express any major concerns or objections during the demonstration and asked clarifying questions to better understand the product's capabilities. They also mentioned that the product seems to align with their needs and use cases. Therefore, it can be inferred that the customer may have a positive view of the product's ability to meet their needs, but a definitive answer cannot be given without further information.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions were aimed at understanding the customer's needs, processes, and technical requirements. Here are some examples:

1. ""We've spent a good amount of time with [PERSON-1] and a few others on the team, really giving us an overview of the use case for [ORG-2] at [ORG-1] properties, some of the technical requirements. [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] were fantastic at [LAW-1] as kind of figuring out your current processes as they relate [DATE-1].""

2. ""So [PERSON-10], you know, we partner with [ORG-2] across the board, but we really specialize in partnering with real estate. And my background has been, you know, spending my career consulting and working in industry for a few different firms, worked at [GPE-2] retail for [DATE-4]. So very intubally familiar with retail malls and how we can help with the leasing processes. I'm excited to be here [DATE-1].""

3. ""So one of the things we always like to discuss first when talking about [ORG-2] is our core values, is they really guide everything we do. In top of the list is trust, right? It's our number one value. And it really means that we act with transparency and lead with our ethics.""

4. ""So I know [ORG-2] might be new to several of you that are on the call [DATE-1]. So one of the things we always like to discuss first when talking about [ORG-2] is our core values, is they really guide everything we do.""

5. ""So what I'm seeing right in front on the left hand side, you see this leasing dashboard is for individual reps. This is for [PERSON-10] specifically. These are all dashboards that are created based off reports. And that report those reports. I'll go into more detail on how you can edit and create the m. off of information that's existent within [ORG-2] platform.""

These questions and statements show that the sales rep is trying to understand the customer's needs and processes, and is positioning [ORG-2] as a solution that can help meet those needs.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the top concerns the customer had about the seller's product.,What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question about the opportunity to create consistency for new hires and help with process training by creating links out to document repositories, checklists, and other resources within the platform. The customer responded positively, indicating that they loved the idea and found it helpful for turnover.
2. Question about the ability to determine the source of a lead and customize the fields accordingly. The customer confirmed that this was possible and noted that everything in the platform was configurable.
3. Question about the possibility of engaging with marketing campaigns and storing that information within the platform. The customer expressed interest in this feature and its potential to help teams collaborate better.

In each of these instances, the sales rep asked questions that resonated with the customer's needs and interests, leading to a more engaged response.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They expressed that the presentation covered the bases and they had no major concerns or unanswered questions. They also mentioned that they would like to go through the list of requirements again in preparation for another round of discussions. Overall, they seemed interested in continuing the conversation and moving forward with the deal.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the correct decision maker was present on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call."
video_19787_167_6qr3y000000kA1pAAE,"Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: No problem.
Agent: And as you may have noticed, we also switched over to Zoom. So hopefully everybody's having a better experience on that as far as getting in.
Agent: Any other comments?
Agent: Did you need us to do Zoom for the demo on [DATE-1], [PERSON-1]?
Agent: You guys took control of the [PRODUCT-1]. The only challenge we typically have doing the [PRODUCT-2] is that with Teams,
Agent: Okay, because I can switch it to zoom, you know, we still have time if you want me to do that, whatever is easier for you guys, because if you want to zoom for whatever reason, be easier for you guys to send stuff to us because when we were doing all of those extensive workshops before with affinity,
Agent: You guys had trouble sharing them with us on our side from Why I think it's weird. Yeah, I'm on the [PERSON-2] SharePoint and then we can get in. So zoom that works better.
Agent: Well, send me a Zoom meeting and then I'll propagate it to the attendees. And there's going to be a few more attending on [DATE-1] too. Few more executives, just FYI for everybody.
Agent: Yeah, that's great. Okay. Anybody else within the updates before we just kind of go through the flow here.
Agent: And [PERSON-1], I can let you run slides if you want. I just wasn't sure. So I brought them up.
Agent: It's okay [PERSON-3] I mean you can just hit him and go through him as well so. We obviously put the forward looking statement in here because publicly chair and company were obligated to do that next slide [PERSON-3].
Agent: So as we typically do in [ORG-1], we'll start off with a thank you for the time. Thank you for the opportunity to be considered and then I'm going to transition right into kind of the,
Agent: Six of us, I think, in the room. And then I also wanted to take a little bit of time since it may be new to people that, you know, the three key companies that are there to help.
Agent: Ensure a successful Implementation if you select this for [ORG-2]. And that would be obviously [PERSON-4] and the team from [ORG-3], [PERSON-5] and the team from [ORG-4]. And then obviously [ORG-1] as the platform.
Agent: And then we're going to transition from that into kind of an executive overview where [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-4] will go over some of our point of view and what we believe is relevant to our expertise and capabilities for brokers like yourself to consider.
Agent: And then review some of the key top validations that we've talked about related to the transformation Then we'll get right into the demonstration. We'll encourage Q&A throughout [DATE-2].
Agent: If people are willing to do that, that would be great. And then just talk about next steps as far as coming out of it. So that's the structure of the presentation in the demo .
Agent: Then I'll go right into the slide to introduce the people. Again, these people will all be there in person for the presentation. And everybody knows everybody on this slide, but I'll introduce them when we get through it.
Agent: And then I'll segue from the people to the companies and why that's relevant.
Agent: [PERSON-4] will give a little bit of a background on [ORG-3], why we chose to make sure that they were part of it because when you specifically asked us about really getting our best talented people around really knowing [ORG-5].
Agent: [PERSON-7]'s and [PERSON-4]'s team really bring a lot of that strength and expertise They really know [ORG-6]'s inside and out and I know that was a big challenge For [PERSON-8], obviously, [PERSON-9] and the good work that they delivered already with th e [ORG-7] bring a lot of that [ORG-1] industry expertise and skill set to the table And then we believe the platform from [ORG-1] is the best possible solution .
Agent: For [ORG-2]. So together the three of us feel very confident that we can deliver a very successful outcome in the shortest possible time to meet the needs of your RDS and beyond. So the next slide.
Agent: This is just kind of a visual to make sure that people understand everything that's out there within the [ORG-1] platform. And so what's highlighted in red is the basically the force.com platform, which is our foundational layer.
Agent: We actually call it hyper force now. And that's what some of our partners like [PERSON-10] day at choose to leverage as their base foundation. And then they put their custom managed package on top.
Agent: Of that force.com platform, you, [PERSON-11], have traditionally leveraged everything in th e Sales Cloud and Service Cloud layer that's highlighted there in green.
Agent: But recently with the las t contract that we just executed in [DATE-3], we were able to give you all of the rights and [GPE-1] e capabilities for everything that's in [ORG-8] in the blue column.
Agent: And so now that' s all available to everybody within the organization,
Agent: Than you had before.
Agent: So the visual here is that as you continue to go up the stack you don't lose anything you just continue to gain capabilities and a lot of the things th at we're going to be showing you [PERSON-9]: And I wanted to kind of set the foundation that [ORG-9] has been out there since [DATE-4].
Agent: We do three major releases [DATE-5] and why that's relevant to you is all of that Innovation that we keep bringing to the table.
Agent: Like a lot of the Innovation that we acquired when we bought [NORP-1] and [GPE-2] and Velocity, which is specifically the insurance footprint where velocity was acquired [DATE-6] now and then moved into the core platform as well.
Agent: It's no longer a managed package.
Agent: It's being moved into all of the core platform, then the [ORG-10] acquisition obviously that you probably heard about And as we continue to roll out more AI and Data Cloud capabilities, all of that will be release d in those three major releases that we do but dedicated specifically for those insurance capabilitie s as well as banking and wealth And if you looked at [ORG-11] , It's a separate business, which we don't report, but it's literally over [MONEY-1] a year run rate business.
Agent: And that would be probably one of the closest to the top 10 software companies in the world just by itself.
Agent: In addition to all the stuff we've been doing with [ORG-9], we've also been recognized by several industry people.
Agent: So this is an IDC report that we just recently got the rights to publish and share with customers, but basically it positions [ORG-1] as a leader for digital experience platforms, specifically in the insurance industry.
Agent: And we're very excited about this recognition and award because it really validates a lot of the work that we've been doing since [DATE-4] with [ORG-9].
Agent: [ORG-11] cloud and the platform and being recognized by such a large industr y entity like [ORG-9] is we're very proud of that. So next slide please .
Agent: [ORG-9] also has recognized sales force and specifically around some of the things that we're doing in insurance. So that's another recognition from a well regarded industry analyst firm.
Agent: And that's another one two keep in mind as you continue to make your decision. And then there's also one more that I wanted to share because it's really relevant to [ORG-5] specifically.
Agent: This is the recognition from [ORG-10], where we received an award for digital and emerging technologies for the work that we did with N2G, which is an [ORG-5] in the commercial lines area, which is a partnership between nationwide and generally.
Agent: They're growing very rapidly and they leverage [ORG-1] to dramatically improve their business. And we have a detailed case study that.
Agent: I can share with you guys now, but also offer to share it with a lot of larger audience on [DATE-1] But that case study has a lot of really good information, particularly as it relates to some of the key themes on the next slide .
Agent: And so not only were they recognized for the digital and emerging technologies, but the speed at which they were able to do it was very impressive.
Agent: So from start to finish, they were able to get into production in [DATE-7].
Agent: You can see on the right, they ultimately ended up rolling out five global product launches and they're continuing to roll out more and more capabilities.
Agent: But it's been a very successful Implementation into G, and it was speaking at [ORG-17].
Agent: And continues to be a real [ORG-17] story for us And I thought that was very relevant considering th e parallels between them and [ORG-2] So I wanted to share that with you And again, I'll share the case study .
Agent: Next slide.
Agent: The last point that I wanted to bring up is because there were some contracts that we were able to put in place that are relevant to [ORG-2] because of the contract that we put in place for affinity, as well as the large [DATE-8] renewal that we did.
Agent: The good news is, is all of the price protections are in place [DATE-9] already all of those contracts are in place, and different LOBs like [ORG-2] are able to buy off of those contracts in those price tables that are already.
Agent: Existing that your procurement organization did a really good job of putting that structure in place And I will also share that as you buy more, we have tiered discounts.
Agent: So the discounts ge t better as you continue to buy more.
Agent: So that was the last slide that I had, but I did want to leave you with th e with the information that from a contractual standpoint, we already have these vehicles in place, and you could just order against those existing contracts if you choose to move forward with us, which we certainly hope you do.
EndUser: So at that point, I would transition then to [PERSON-6], and so [PERSON-6]. [PERSON-1], [PERSON-9] here. So a question that could be asked, what's been negotiated recently with [PERSON-2].
EndUser: So are the discounts holistic, meaning all the divisions combined or per division?
EndUser: How does that work?
EndUser: Because [PERSON-10] might not know that. And just for clarity for everybody, [PERSON-10] has a merger partner meeting on this time [DATE-1]. We didn't want to reschedule because we don't want to slow this down.
EndUser: The decision is pretty close here on being made in [DATE-10] or so is what we think. So [PERSON-17] will be on the call, but we'll.
EndUser: Will have other heavy hitters there as well that would help influence the decision So just wanted to make sure everybody knew that because there's not going to be a lo t of people beyond [PERSON-17] and I in the room on [DATE-1] Some of them will be on the call.
EndUser: So I just want to be clear on that. So everybody understood expectations .
Agent: So, you know, we were obviously hoping to get face time with [PERSON-10]. So that's a little disappointing, but I understand the conflict. So we'll, we'll just continue to do that.
EndUser: You know, our goal is not only to do this presentation, but come back and do the executive readout. So, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll have you meet [PERSON-10] in a different time.
EndUser: He apologized, but he just pinged me [DATE-11]. That's, that's the messages you got from [GPE-3] [DATE-11], [PERSON-1].
Agent: Got it. So I'll be sure to emphasize that. Thanks for that update. I'll be sure to put that in my talk track.
Agent: But yes, any business unit, anybody at [PERSON-2], these contracts are in place for the entire corporation to take advantage of. And the reason why that's really relevant.
Agent: I mean, [PERSON-17], this goes back to the, you know, the thumb in the air kind of deals where people were trying to figure out what would [ORG-1] cost if we did this at [ORG-2].
Agent: And the good news is, is We don't have to guess anymore I mean, the contracts in place, the price holds are in place and they're pretty aggressive discounts So [PERSON-10] and his team can take advantage of all of those <inaudible> e concessions that are in place [DATE-9] And those contracts are in force at least the major [PERSON-17] r renewals in place until, I think, [DATE-9] S o
Agent: Anyhow, we've got contracts taken care of. I'll make sure I include that in my talk. So in that good Interaction back to you, thanks.
Agent: I was just, that's kind of the flow for me to go for it from there.
Agent: And then at this point, this is when I would turn it over to [PERSON-6], you know, and then that one slide that I have with the three bubbles, [PERSON-4]'s going to add some color commentary there.
Agent: And [PERSON-5]'s going to add some color commentary to kind of give their, you know, elevator pitch on who's, who's [ORG-3] and who's, who's gerant for the people in the room that don't know.
Agent: And so then at this point, I would transition to [PERSON-6] and she's going to.
Agent: Kind of go over what we're doing for brokers and so forth . [PERSON-6], don't let me talk for you . go ahead and.. . yeah, no worries .
Agent: I want to make sure that this is right-size d for the audience . I was thinking.. .
Agent: To start with what our overall vision is and let everyone in the room know that we are planning a Tier 1 product launch at [ORG-17] on what we're calling insurance brokerage, which in essence is an [ORG-17] replacement.
Agent: We have a, you know, development is full speed ahead right now and we've got a lot of excitement in the market.
Agent: We also have some very excited design partners of which of course we'd love to invite anyone within [PERSON-2] to join if they're so interested.
Agent: But this would be our overall vision really to break down these silos and create a holistic view of your business across any lines of business in a way so that you can action on it and know what you're doing.
Agent: Go to the next slide, please. This goes into more specifics on the investment areas, including agency management foundations, commissions, especially specialization for lines of business.
Agent: I will be able to touch on [PERSON-21] at this point and explain, yeah, there's, there's two sites to the [PERSON-21] integrations.
Agent: There's the sending data from a carrier into [PERSON-21] and then being able to download it from [PERSON-21] into an [ORG-21]. We've been able to successfully work with applied to show the.
Agent: We have several anecdotal evidence, if you will, that it's not hard to take that data and ingest it back into sales force .
Agent: Applied, however, has not been as excited to do a proof of concept with us on that direction, primarily because they see us as a competitor to [ORG-14].
Agent: So we do have, we have talked with [PERSON-4] and team about their, what that would have to be in the scope of work is to be able to write that Integration to take your batch downloads from [PERSON-14]'s and put it back into [ORG-9].
Agent: And I'm assuming since your [PERSON-2] you'll be able to get those downloads as part of your [PERSON-14] subscription.
EndUser: Well, we need to download not the upload. So, yeah.
Agent: So you would be able, I mean, you would just need access to that batch data from [PERSON-21], which is what you pay for as that subscription.
Agent: And then we would have to write an Integration to send it back into [ORG-9].
EndUser: Okay, so it's not as difficult as stated is what I'm hearing you say. It's not through sales force, I mean overall.
EndUser: It's because we did it with one of our branches and it was like, it took [DATE-9], honestly, for us to get every LOBN.
Agent: It's known and as long as we've got patterns for it already, it's the [ORG-24] transfer. We've actually got another team that's been working on.
Agent: We just released an accelerator for [ORG-17] systems that sends data directly from an [ORG-17] back into [ORG-1]. And they're also that team that's our [ORG-17] team is going to start working on an [PERSON-14]'s accelerator too.
Agent: So I think between us, our team and what [PERSON-4] can bring, it definitely can't be done. But I can't say that it's out of the box. You just flip a switch. So.
EndUser: Ok, that's helpful. That's better than I thought. So [PERSON-6], thank you.
Agent: No problem. And then of course looking at agency billing and accounting and what that would mean.
Agent: These are investment areas that we've got, you know, some things that we're going to solve through our core platform on top of [ORG-9] and some things that we're going to solve through integrations.
Agent: Of course, everything that's built on platform is available with our APIs. Agency billing and invoicacy would need, I think, a little more work around in terms not work around as in work around. I mean, work.
Agent: Pause around looking at how you want to solve that and what your ERP strategy looks like so that we can complement and send, you know, calculations where we need to send the data where we need to, but also take a look at what you're planning to do for, you know, kind of a elevated invoice capability.
Agent: Now these, I'd love your opinion, [PERSON-24] and [PERSON-17], on, you know, I'm almost thinking now because we'd probably want to get into the demonstration that maybe the first two slides are enough for where we're going with our roadmap.
Agent: But you tell me if you want additional, you know, commentary around why we're building on [ORG-11] cloud, you know, all of the things you get from it, etc.
Agent: So I don't want to be redundant, but I also want to be, you know,
EndUser: Yeah, I think the first two are fine. I think the main thing we want to get out of this meeting is like we talk about partners with [ORG-1]. That's chaching every time.
EndUser: So whatever we put together as the estimate to go to [PERSON-17] has to be holistic and we have to have in included items of what we need that [ORG-1] does not have.
EndUser: Like rate quote by an issue, will we be able to do that?
EndUser: [PERSON-14]'s download, what you said is good, but then we would still need an [ORG-16] partner to do all the work on that.
EndUser: So what would that cost?
EndUser: What about the accounting piece?
EndUser: Because I'm hearing through affinity. they're trying to figure that out right now . those kinds of things are major .
EndUser: Are there anything else that could be brought [ORG-16] in the meeting ?
EndUser: What I'm trying to get ahead of, if you will . that we have answers . all those things need to be talked about . then you have our RDS, maybe take a scenario .
EndUser: Maybe that's what you're thinking of doing , scenario, you know, and actually sho w how [DATE-10] in the life would actually happen . need to be able to visualize , [PERSON-16] producer is going to be using .
EndUser: Salesforce to do everything in her world. Here's how it would look and [PERSON-17] has been a producer a top producer He's our president now.
EndUser: So he knows things pretty well probably more than [PERSON-10] does on [DATE-10] in the life So just a little background and not to dilute what [PERSON-10] knows I don't mean it that way, but I think he's been a leader where [PERSON-10] has been more in the weeds as a producer
Agent: Yep, and I think, I mean, that was super helpful sending over the, you know, the information about [DATE-10] in the life.
Agent: And I know that that's what [PERSON-16] and [PERSON-3] have been working hard on in terms of the demo. Great. Fantastic.
Agent: So maybe we, uh, can we just go through a couple of these slides, [PERSON-3]?
Agent: And I'll just double check that we don't need them. I don't think we need that. We've already talked about where we're there. Go to the next one. We've already, I mean, [PERSON-1]'s already kind of added the architecture side.
Agent: This just goes even deeper. It might be overkill next one. This one, let me know if this makes sense to touch on the reason I have this slide and this has helped with other brokerages who.
Agent: Have been on legacy systems and just that traditional mindset in terms of all of these components and what the difference is between being on like an aim versus what you can do on [ORG-1].
Agent: So, you know, this would include just the baseline functionality and you know we've got the we've got the standard operating procedures your training guide on aim and, you know, it's. pages.
Agent: So there's a lot there that you have to learn how to do. But you know that you're kind of locked into that, whatever they've given you, that's what you have.
Agent: Whereas with [ORG-1], of course, you can keep on Innovation innovating and you can make it your own. You're not locked into a certain way of doing things.
Agent: The enhancements again need to come from [GPE-4] and the AME example with [ORG-1], you can have a center of excellence, a governance that you can create enhancements yourself, etc. Let me know if this makes sense for that audience.
Agent: This has worked well just to ground everyone in what you're going to see when we do the demo.
EndUser: I think this is a good slide.
EndUser: [PERSON-17], what do you think?
EndUser: My only reservation is more of this being, if we, I would prefer to have more of a demonstration rather than talking on this primarily to avoid this is a technology decision.
EndUser: And so I'd like to kind of see more of, this is [DATE-10] in the life if possible.
Agent: All right, so I'll just stick to the two slides that are roadmap so people know and we can talk to those specific points on Okay, the downing. Yeah, and then we'll get right to the demo. That sounds good.
Agent: Okay. Okay. I do think that you were bringing up [ORG-26] of [GPE-5] is that what's different about this approach though is that you aren't beholding to a vendor for
Agent: Customization and changes right I mean that that's a key point that we think is something you've been asking for right You don't want to be in the situation to where you have to go back to either a single source vendor o r limited number of resources .
Agent: To do changes to a black box.
Agent: I mean, with [ORG-1] being open, and the fact that you already have such a large skill set in house that already knows the solution, and you've been using it for [DATE-17], we look for a time where you guys are basically in charge of all of this, right?
Agent: I mean, [PERSON-17]'s and a [ORG-25], and you guys are just cranking out any changes that you need yourself and you're controlling your own destiny as opposed to being beholden to somebody as some of these other traditional software type black box approaches.
Agent: So that was one of the key themes and maybe we can just bring that forward into some of those other talk tracks, [PERSON-6].
Agent: Yep, we'll do. Okay.
Agent: Then we transition over to [PERSON-4]. So I like the idea of doing those two slides, [PERSON-6], and then we'll adjust that talk track a little bit for being able to. you know, control your own destiny.
EndUser: And I think that's where [PERSON-5] made taking back off of [PERSON-6]'s talk track, because through the Implementation process, we work and we've been talking with affinity about this too, right?
EndUser: How we enable them and upskill them so that they can take over at some point.
Agent: Yeah, I know that was a key thing for [PERSON-26], because he was like, look, we, in their previous situation, you know, they were so beholden to origami, they really wanted to make sure that, whatever platform they chose or whatever solution they chose, that you know, [PERSON-25] and team would be able to do their own, their own work and not be beholden to a third party.
Agent: So good call out [PERSON-38]. All right, in this point, [PERSON-6], [PERSON-6] will transition over to [PERSON-4]. Go ahead [PERSON-4].
EndUser: And so the rest of [DATE-9] is going to focus and going forward is going to focus on getting two answers in these three critical areas for the business. And they're at different levels.
EndUser: The first one truly is around a decision.
EndUser: Does [ORG-38] meet the day-to-day needs?
EndUser: So does this meet the digital strategy?
EndUser: Is this a service platform that works for [ORG-2] and its needs all the way through from the single business to the complex programs and commercial?
EndUser: Be looking at doing that through a series of.. . of workshops.
EndUser: The second one is, does the platform overall, all the pieces that have been talked about really allow for a transformation to move the [ORG-2] onto this platform and sunset some of the technology, modify the processes to be more effective going forward.
EndUser: And allow for the ability to add capabilities and grow for [ORG-2] as it continues to grow.
EndUser: And then third one is a decision around does this, does a [ORG-1] technology stack really meet the needs of what the organization needs from a go forward technology investment and align with the trends of the goals and the needs that are critical across the organization so the technical needs.
EndUser: Those are the three key decision points that if They line up, which we believe that they are as yes, and yes, that it makes sense to move forward with [ORG-1].
EndUser: So we're looking at those three, both now and coming back as we come back for the executive session later to ensure that these have been met.
EndUser: To get there, we are going to ask to go through a workshop framework with each of the key groups. And this is a combination.
EndUser: [PERSON-24], this goes back to your comment around making sure we understand which areas are really out of the box, which ones they're going to need an [ORG-16] partner to help integrate or build, and which ones might be complex and custom in configuration so that we can estimate the implementation, have a full cost across the hole in here.
EndUser: Implementation of the RDS and make sure that we're in alignment going into the process rather than discovery and figuring out what happens after the process.
EndUser: So distribution management's a focus area, submission management is focused, product management rating, carrier management, and then accounting and support functions so that we're lined up with what the solution is anticipated to be and what the level of effort would be both from [ORG-1], the SI, [ORG-3] and [PERSON-33].
EndUser: And [PERSON-2] so that that's lined up for an effective structure. The way we're looking to do that is through workshop structure which is a half day session on each of these main topics.
EndUser: Covering the business process alignment, the capabilities, both demonstration and need, aligning that to what is out of the box, understanding simple medium or complex configurations required, finalizing the scoping, and then being able to come out with the approach and estimate for each of the main areas.
EndUser: That are here aligning to where the future is as far as the process goes, not where [DATE-9] is and around where the distribution needs.
EndUser: So that's taking the different various levels within [ORG-2] from single straight through type of single product. that is being placed all the way through complex program and products.
EndUser: So one comment on that, this is really good. I would definitely emphasize a little bit more the workshop thinking, like how we would do iterations because that you kind of brushed on that.
EndUser: But I already know that because I've talked to [ORG-1] and others and you multiple times, so I know that.
EndUser: But that's not going to be clear to [PERSON-17] unless you really call that out, like how you would go about that and how you would go about that.
EndUser: You would approach it becaus e niblitz is the way to go wit h this team. You do days and day s on it . they kind of lose focus.
EndUser: And then the other thing I wanted to add was, you know, just really how that would work. If they can visualize and see and understand how we would go about it, that might be a little bit more helpful.
EndUser: Just a little tidbit I wanted to add.
EndUser: Perfect. I may add a slide then that hits those key points then. Just so it just adds an informative so that they walk away having a good understanding of how this could work. Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, because they're going to be thinking, we've got to drive the car where we're changing the wheels.
EndUser: So how do we keep selling and they make our huge numbers for [DATE-17], why we're transforming to a whole new platform?
EndUser: How does that happen?
EndUser: And what kind of time is going to be needed from my producers and a lot of people in [ORG-2] can visualize the future.
EndUser: They can visualize the here and now [DATE-9] to make the sale, but there's only a few people that can visualize, hey, where do we need to go, if that makes sense.
EndUser: Because we got to have the right people in these workshops too .
EndUser: More on us than you, obviously . Yeah. And so if I missed that in the meeting, please add to that, [PERSON-24], because you're right in alignment with what we're trying to do.
EndUser: Okay, I will. No worries. I'll interjective.
EndUser: Okay. Thank you.
EndUser: Sure. Okay.
EndUser: So with that is kind of the background. Let's kind of jump into the demo and spend the rest of [DATE-9] working through and showing [DATE-10] in the life that has been put together. And [PERSON-1].
EndUser: You want to walk through the high level of this and then pass it to [PERSON-3].
Agent: Yeah, so [DATE-9]'s product demonstration is anchored on the RDS that you shared with us, and you're going to see that we've put together a tailored demonstration based on your specific situation.
Agent: And so throughout the demo, you're going to see us talking about the account and submission management process, reports and dashboards, the communications, status updates, as well as quoting and rating, getting into the multi-layer programs, as well as a little bit on claims management, and then an update concerns around accounting that [PERSON-6] already touched on .
Agent: Earlier. So with that as a backdrop, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to [PERSON-3] to start the demonstration.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-16].
Agent: So our plan is to go through the demonstration using two personas, one regional manager that I will walk through for the first part of it, and then a accounting executive that [PERSON-16] will walk through in [DATE-17].
Agent: So for our regional manager, we're going to focus on that kind of high-level overview, managing relationships with retail brokers, managing their day-to-day work.
Agent: Managing kind of that relationship with one of their agents, one of the retail agents that they work with, and then kind of getting a view into the submissions that have come in and then handing it over to [PERSON-16] to walk through.
Agent: Really kind of the end to end in the life process. So let me switch over.
Agent: They're in [TIME-1].
Agent: And many screens.
Agent: Let me know if you guys can see
Agent: Salesforce. Okay, perfect.
Agent: So I'm, I'm logged in as a mirror.
Agent: So when a mirror lands in [ORG-1], she's going to be greeted with her homepage and with a few key dashboards that she's going to be driving just kind of heard day off of and insights into the business.
Agent: So a way thing you want to do approach this is getting that pile overview of the book of business being able to interact with data that's either in the system or being fed into the system so I can see kind of across all of our business, what our revenue, our clients are, you know, the different clients spending on what industry they're in and we can drive really any metrics right to the surface through these dashboards.
Agent: And so I can get that overview of my book of business and then I can go and start to. deepen that insight into our relationships with those retail agents that we work with.
Agent: So I can see the region that I'm managing and all of the retail agents that are bringing business to us so I can get an understanding of where we're being successful and where we need to grow more, and which agencies are are producing the most for us and sending us the greatest number of submissions and kind of what the performance of those submissions are.
Agent: So I can start to really just drill into the metrics that are going to drive my business. And then as I'm working with different agencies, I can drill down into the metrics on specific producers that we work with.
Agent: So we can kind of think of drilling down through the different layers of, you know, looking at the overall bucket business, then looking at our overall relationships with our retail agencies and then drilling down into, specific relationships with individual producers and seeing their performance.
Agent: And another nice thing about the capabilities within the platform is we can build out this type of dashboard for any of our relationships, whether it's the the underwriters on our teams or the producers that we work with or kind of back-end support teams, we can kind of see metrics across all of those different groups.
Agent: And then I can also just get some high level insights into my day of what are specific tasks that I need to be working through.
Agent: If there are any events that I have coming up [DATE-9] and then I can see an overall activity completion for the team and just get a high low view of performance of the team as I'm just kind of starting my day.
Agent: And then.
Agent: What I want to jump into next is so drilling off of my home page, I want to dive into one of the specific accounts for one of our retail agents that we're working with and just get those details that high lower overview interactions that we're having with this with this agency.
Agent: So I can get the details of the brokerage, all the main information as I think we're all used to seeing in [ORG-1]. all filled out .
Agent: Either by our underives, by the system, or brought in from external systems, I can see the interactions that we're having any meetings or calls or tasks that are associated.
Agent: And then I can see automated action plans that have been created by the system for meetings that we have coming up or any other processes that we want to automate and assign out tasks to different individuals.
Agent: And then I can see overall business milestones, like an agency acquisition or a merger, or if they had any changes in their leadership, we can easily capture that right in the account record page.
Agent: And then I can start to drill into at the sprokerage who are the producers that work there and what's our relationship to them and I can even drill deeper into those producer relationships.
Agent: I can see the policies that are associated. to this agency and then we can draw it deeper into these as we go throughout the process.
Agent: And I think you'll see this get built out as [PERSON-16] walks through [DATE-10] in the life from the county executive.
Agent: And then the final piece that I wanted to just jump to is the list of submissions or opportunities that have come in from from [PERSON-21] from this from this producer so we're able to see that full list of submissions that they have sent in so we get this holistic view.
Agent: Of their relationship with rps and what kind of business they're sending us.
Agent: And so now I'll transition it out to [PERSON-16]'s and he's going to walk through the end to end process of getting a submission in and then going all the way through to the buying process.
Agent: [PERSON-24] and and [PERSON-17], what do you think of the first the first few. Binettes or the first few looks.
EndUser: Well, it was good.
Agent: Anything else you want added in there or that you think could be helpful like from that high level like manager view for the audience on [DATE-1] to see
Agent: No, seems good. Thank you. Yeah, I think we're I think it's good because it's we only have [TIME-2]. I think it's good. Okay. All right, [PERSON-16], all you
Agent: All right, can you see my screen there?
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Ok, great. So I will pick up, like I said, I'll pick up from where he is as he's gone through things. I've logged into the digital platform as well as [PERSON-8].
Agent: And [PERSON-24], is this where you would refer to [PERSON-8] as an account executive or would he be called a producer in your world here?
Agent: Because there's the retail worker.
Agent: Do you mean [PERSON-34]?
Agent: No, sorry, [PERSON-8]. My user here, as I'm logged in, I'm a producer, or I'm not the retail broker, I'm working on behalf of [ORG-2] to complete that submission and to get it out to market.
Agent: What would you refer to that individual as?
Agent: Is that a producer?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Ok. All right. I'll rename them. We've labeled them like a go-to-market or an accounting executive output of... producer in there. So I'm acting on his behalf and I'm logged into the same application.
Agent: Now, you see the application has changed slightly and what's visible to me. This is more of an action oriented landing homepage as opposed to a dashboard and managerial.
Agent: So you'll see quickly up in the top of my [DATE-9] task. Those are a little different than what [PERSON-3] saw because those are specific to me and those are things that have been assigned to me specifically.
Agent: I don't have any events on the calendar [DATE-9]. This is my own personal calendar with an inside of [ORG-1]. So as things come up, they would be visible there.
Agent: Very similar to what [PERSON-3] saw in the management dashboard was a new submissions list of what has come in and needs to be worked. So this would be kind of the cue approach to managing these submissions.
Agent: I can go in and I can pick one of these and drill into it. These that you see here, [DATE-21], [DATE-14], these are actually using our email services.
Agent: So we've emailed into the system and it's automatically created that opportunity. When it creates that opportunity, it hits the system right away so that we can begin to assign that and get that out to the right individual.
Agent: It also creates a set of actions that need to be completed. We call those an action plan for that opportunity.
Agent: So what we did was we took that operating procedure document and we took a few of the flow items out of there and we created an action plan based on the steps that are necessary to manage a submission.
Agent: When that action plan is created, it creates those tasks and those activities and those are going to be assigned to individuals based on whether based on who created the action plan based on a role based on a responsibility.
Agent: Etc.
Agent: When this opportunity hit the system, [DATE-14], for this quote for general liability, it created an action plan and we can see that one of those tasks got assigned to me and is showing up here in [DATE-9]'s task.
Agent: So I don't need to necessarily work from this queue. I can. I can go into it directly. Or I can just say, OK, here's the things that are high priority for me. I need to complete these things [DATE-9].
Agent: One of those is I need to perform a clearance search on this new submission that came in. I'll drill into that submission directly from this task list. So again, no hunting around for work to be done.
Agent: I'm going to work right for my home page. It's very action driven. When I get land on this opportunity, now again, this was an email brought in. I haven't entered any of this information. This was all through automation.
Agent: The body of the email is mapped into the description so we can see what was written in from the email. They'd like to quote for the statement of values for General [PERSON-38]. It's a [GPE-6] client.
Agent: They've attached a loss run and an SOV. Those attachments are visible down here in the notes and attachments. We're going to automatically attach those to the opportunity for safe keeping and reference.
Agent: And we also know where this came from. This came from Leaven agency as the agency or broker and the primary producer there was [PERSON-38]. So that we're tracking that bit of information.
Agent: At this point, we've got the action items that we need to complete. One of those is a clearance search.
Agent: And if I'm having trouble or I'm new to the system and I need help performing that clearance search, we've got knowledge embedded here. So I can simply type in perform clearance search.
Agent: And I'm going to get help files for your new submission and both process.
Agent: And if I mouse over that, I've got details from the document you share with us about how do I clear a submission?
Agent: How do I perform those searches?
Agent: So help right here within the application. So that's one area to kind of help users transition into a new world, into a new system as they use it.
Agent: So for now, what we'll do is we'll go ahead and we'll take this opportunity and we'll kick off this guided process that's visible here in this action launcher.
Agent: In our world of [ORG-1], [ORG-33] is a framework to be able to launch guided processes for the user where you're actually initiating and executing a business process, as opposed to me going into the opportunity, going into the quote screen, create a new record, choose the record type, populate the fields.
Agent: These are going to, this is going to guide the user through the appropriate steps and allow [ORG-16] and automation throughout that process.
Agent: So what I've done is I've taken a little bit of the information kinsured with that [ORG-21], and we created a guided process to help us guide through that process.
Agent: I'll click that link and launch that guided process for creating the rating.
Agent: So here we know the account because we knew the opportunity that we started from, so it's context sensitive, we can bring that information in, we can also upload those SOBs directly from the CSV.
Agent: So I'll choose yes, I'll upload those files, We'll pick the file.
Agent: And as you see the status, as soon as this is uploaded and you see a green check here, then that file is uploaded and in the system and ready to go.
Agent: Now what I have not done for this demonstration, is art of the possible right now, I want to be fully transparent.
Agent: We're not importing, we're not bringing the file from the opportunity into this process yet, that is doable with some configuration work. For the sake of time, I'm just simply importing it again.
Agent: And using the opportunity as a landing place for reference of that file. When we upload that document, we see those entries come in. Now, this is a high-level summary of those entries.
Agent: If we want to make adjustments to it, then we would edit those, and we can edit any of those field values that have come in.
Agent: And if we want to add, maybe we missed some real property value here, and notice that my total is 17.1101167957481438. Let's say that we've got another 1101 in real property value.
Agent: Then we're going to update that total [ORG-34] in real-time as we go through this process. So now we're at 9.0381795964171.
Agent: Next step is to go through and can mention that some of this goes through the ping identity for cleansing. Maybe there's some changes that are made based on the data that comes back.
Agent: So we'll see that total value was updated again. We were at 17.7973407349781. Now we're at 11.682616598877740. And again, another chance to edit that if necessary. You can see that I put in 795,000 there.
Agent: The information that came back from paying would be 17,000. So we can overwrite and adjust as necessary. Now I'm gonna go into that. We've captured the details, we've cleansed the information.
Agent: Let's get into the rating of these properties now that we know that the properties are in a good place. and we're going to do this for general liabilities.
Agent: We're going to pick the product that we want to quote here and that's going to drive a look into our product configuration of what's available. Our locations continue to come in. The rest of this would be auto-populated.
Agent: I'm going to go ahead and click on demo auto-fill and that just simply fills this information so you don't have to watch me type it. And then we can upload lots from reports.
Agent: I'm going to pick up my pace a bit because I will have more time on [DATE-1]. But this is just one option for quoting and writing. So we'll go through this.
Agent: Ability is to select multiple carriers and quote through those carriers and get those quotes. If we wanted to, we could configure this so that maybe we want two force them.
Agent: We want to do business with [PRODUCT-3], but if we don't, and the producer decides not to quote [PRODUCT-3], we want to require, hey, why did you not quote through them so we can capture that information and better that relationship.
Agent: Or if you have, an in-house division that underwrites some of these.
Agent: Maybe you want two force them to quote through the in-house every single time we can make that a mandatory feel that is not editable and is required so that always comes back. Now it's taken the inputs.
Agent: It's taken the attributes we've collected and the carriers, and it's gone out and it's said, OK, here's some product options that are available from the various carriers, whether that be fiber, [PERSON-16], or [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: And we can see different price points. This is where I've configured a little bit of a dynamic nature of the demonstration.
Agent: If we wanted to do a single product, we could select that product and we could move forward and we could configure that product.
Agent: Or in the case of like a program with multiple products and multiple layers of risks, I've set this process up that way so that when I click next, it's actually going to generate a quote and it's going to put all of those products from those carriers so that we can configure and quote from each of those carriers and then break that risk apart.
EndUser: Oh, I've got to add one thing here that you might want to accentuate is we have something it's a limitation [DATE-9] and aim where they want to send out various letters to multiple carriers at the same time they have to [DATE-9] do them individually and this is a real pain point.
EndUser: So I know [ORG-1] takes care of this so you might want to interweave this in the conversation. Just a thought.
Agent: Yeah. And since it's only [DATE-24], I actually have that where we send through multiple carriers and contacts. I'll see what I can pull and put in here for that.
EndUser: Yeah, if you could demo and show that real time, that would be a real win because that's a pain point [DATE-9]. Thank you.
EndUser: I have an example where it's more of a brokerage solution where it's where the we're going out to RFP
Agent: And we're sending those RFP responses or we're gathering questions and we're sending those out to all carriers at the same time, would something like that fit, or would it be better to be more letter related?
EndUser: Rfp.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: All right, I will pull that into this into this example as well. Okay. Good point. So this creates a quote and, and, uh, associates it to the opportunity.
Agent: So I'll jump forward and we'll go into the, um, quote process. So from here we can do the automation, of course, where we land on the quotes. Let me just manually go into a quote here.
Agent: And I will update this so that it will be more streamlined. I'm kind of in a hurry here since we're running out of time for [DATE-10].
Agent: So I'll click on the quote. Once we come out of that process and we land on the quote, there's a guidance, what we call in-application guidance.
Agent: Again, to help you with business change, they can either dismiss this or use it. It will learn who uses it, who doesn't. So it doesn't continue to pop up for that individual.
Agent: But as we click next, we can see that it will actually tell us where to click and what to view and how to use the system. I'll go ahead and else snooze this.
Agent: Totally configurable, very easy to get set up. It's all within the application. But we can view the details of the quote. We can see if there's any underwriting exception. So underwriting exceptions are written based off of product rules.
Agent: We can see this one did not have any exceptions. But later in the demonstration, we'll talk about that product configuration and setup and how we can execute those rules.
Agent: So we went from an email submission, we went through the guided process for the quote. That's one way to get the quote into the system.
Agent: The other way is for a broker themselves to join and enter into a broker portal and the broker can then submit the quote manually via their process.
Agent: So as I come in via [PERSON-38] in the broker portal, I could come down and do a create quote.
Agent: [PERSON-38] isn't going to be asked, well, what type of quote do you need?
Agent: I need a commercial quote. Well, this commercial quote process triggers the exact same process that I had on the other side.
Agent: Only we see that there's no context yet, right?
Agent: There's no account showing here, because this is just frank doing a general quote.
Agent: He can either upload those SOVs like we did before, or if he doesn't want to upload them, then you can simply do a new, and you can enter that information manually. We just automated that process with the upload.
Agent: And so he can go through that exact same process. We'll go ahead and import these.
Agent: So what we're doing now is we're just creating a second quote. Only we're doing it as the retail broker through the broker portal. And we'll upload those.
Agent: We get our statements of value, and we'll just move forward with those. There's our properties. Let's go through the rating. So I won't go through the whole process.
Agent: Just another avenue of being able to do that quote directly as the broker. And now I'll come back as our producer within risk placement services. And we were on that quote.
Agent: So I want to jump now into a multi-layered program. And then we're going to come back and revisit a quote and product configuration and actually issue and bind that quote and see what that looks like.
Agent: But from a multi-layered program, I've got it. a policy in place here that I'm following a root risk policy.
Agent: And we've got this for safety sign that we've set up, so we've got a little bit more data that we can walk through and show. We show all the policies that are covering this root risk.
Agent: We can see the back commercial errors and omissions, employee liability, employment practices. and the risk taken of those policies.
Agent: In the case where we've got general liability and it's a split risk, then we're gonna indicate where the risk lies as well as whether that's a tier one or a tier two or your priority one, priority two, or potentially a lead fallout, however you call those in your business.
Agent: I got it. [PERSON-1]'s check up in your business. And then if we need to, we can go through that policy structure and what this looks like.
Agent: But what this allows for is that because now we have the root policy and we have each of these policies or quotes, then each of these can be managed separately.
Agent: So if I were to drill into one of these Professional liability as one of these, I'll call it child policies of the root. We've got all the details of that policy.
Agent: We can see that for this policy, we've got claims filed on it. We don't have, we have one activity that was done that claims submission. So that's already been completed and sent.
Agent: We know the producer on this was 11 agency, but it was [PERSON-38] instead of [PERSON-38] on this policy. So we can track that.
Agent: And then of course, we can look at the coverages of this policy, what was chosen. We can generate the Revenue schedule of this policy and we can look at earn versus unearned.
Agent: This is all part of our policy services in the solution. And then of course, billing transaction, whether that be future or past.
Agent: We can see in the past dates, we've got the transaction and we've got the posted date and we actually have a premium payment that we're expecting and it has not posted yet.
Agent: And that would be for our [DATE-17] payment. So we can track that. We also can look through all the insured items and then we've got related.
Agent: Related is any record in the system that holds information about this policy or related to it. We've created a quick list here of all of the related things so we can see that there's two claims associated to this.
Agent: There's a policy term associated to this. There's a brokerage split associated to this and I can see what those brokerage splits are with [PERSON-21]. Agency unified drill into that. I can see that there's a split.
Agent: And there's a couple different payees on this split on the 9 side of the agency. So I'll come back to the.
Agent: There we go to my policy here and again, and then I've got all the related records action lunch or changes here for the policy. Whether it's sending documents of big in the address or the endorsement quote.
Agent: And so just walking through what that policy looks like.
Agent: Then up at the root level, if I wanted to file a claim, whether it be as the end user or as a broker, or they call in, then I would file the claim process here and I can capture the relevant details for filing a claim.
Agent: In this case, we'll call it errors and omissions. Again, what you're seeing here is the guided process that we can go through and just capture that information and pass it on to the collector here. Very dynamic in nature.
Agent: Maybe we want to ask some questions, like some knockout questions, like how many claims, what they have for, they're okay. If it goes to five claims, that's going to trigger additional investigation.
Agent: So let's have them confirm that it's five, and they would need to confirm that disclosure. And then move forward.
Agent: Now this is where the system can either decide which carriers this claim is filed against, and we've looked up the policies that make up this risk and where the risk was taken, and we've identified these three policies that this claim would be filed against.
Agent: Or based on your business, you could choose which carriers you're going to file that claim for.
Agent: And so the claim process, again, goes through the wrap up and the complete and automatically creates those records, automatically would send those out through the integrations with those carriers or notifications.
Agent: And then from there, what I would like to do in the demo, and I know we're out of time [DATE-9], is to go specifically into product management. So we went through the quoting email submission, quoting as a broker.
Agent: And product, and then I'd like to come in and say, okay, let's go into our product management, and specifically, let's go into a product called Professional liability, and let's talk about, I set this up for our demonstration, how we would configure the product, how we would determine what those coverages are, how we could write rules and underwriting exceptions and eligibility, associate commissions and commission schedules, taxes fees, we can do product simulation, and then how this ties to the rating engine and then what that rating engine looks like.
Agent: So I would go from product configuration into the details here. The details then point to how this is rated.
Agent: So I would pull the rating procedure here and I would go into the rating procedure specifically, talk about version control, effective dating, and then go into the actual reading procedure and how this is a drag and drop designer.
Agent: And we can see here that much like in your [PRODUCT-4] spreadsheet, there's often lookups to other tabs. We have those lookups and we pass in an input, we pass in an output.
Agent: I'll talk about how this is tied to the product. We do our lookups and then we perform our calculations to get an outcome. And then that passes back for the product rating.
Agent: We also have the ability to simulate these so I would show a simulation. And when you simulate these. It tracks through. I'll just do this real quick because this is about.
Agent: [PERSON-16], if you've got extra time, [PERSON-17] said he's got [TIME-3] so you can show something. Yeah. I put a buffer in just in case.
Agent: Great.
EndUser: So I would pass in. So these things that I'm typing in here are the inputs that would actually come from the product. Thanks guys, I have to hop. I really appreciate it.
EndUser: I'll do the introductions, [PERSON-1] [DATE-1] and then hand it over to you. I'll give you a heads up of who will be attending because there's gonna be other producers and leaders on the call.
EndUser: And then could you send me the Zoom that you want?
EndUser: And I'll propagate that in the meeting. Thank you very much. This is good, this is really good. So thank you for your time here.
Agent: Appreciate it. Thank you. [PERSON-35].
EndUser: I need to run as well. So I will catch up with you, [PERSON-1]. Thanks. Okay.
Agent: Gotcha. Thanks.
Agent: So as we put those inputs in and we simulate that, we can see each of the steps that were completed as part of that simulation, even down to the point of what was the input passed in?
Agent: Well, the input was 1 million flame, 1 million, 541 was the output. And then we continue to look those up.
Agent: And so we can see at each step of our process where it failed, what we're expecting, make sure we can confirm those, and then even as far as the calculations, what did the received input into this calculation, and what was the output of this calculation.
Agent: And then ultimately, over here on the left, what our total outcomes are. I can modify and do different scenarios here. So for example, what's our total out here now is 5,957.
Agent: Let's say that our employee count went to 17,000. And I want to simulate that. And rather than 5,957, now I'm at 24,000. So I can confirm that my calculations are reacting accordingly. So I can simulate that here.
Agent: So what I've done is I've tied the product. Let me come back to the product here. Professional liability. When we look at those coverages and I click on let's say coverage limits, limits here.
Agent: There's an attribute for these limits. There's the selections that they can pick from a product perspective. You saw that injured in my simulation and that's going in from the product because it's triggered as rating.
Agent: It's mapped as an input and then we get an output back. And I can also simulate this now one level up.
Agent: At the product level and say based on the effective date, remember those are version controlled and effective dated. My output right now is blank. I've got 39 employees in here.
Agent: And if I simulate this, then I'm gonna have my output and I can see I've got 4,319 coming back as total pricing.
Agent: Again, if I change my employee count, I know that one will adjust the price and I re-simulate that rather than 4,319 now I'm coming back to 14,000. So product to the rating back to the product.
Agent: Now let's go back to our original opportunity. Rather than going through the guided process of here, where we're automatically uploading and doing that automation for you, we can also manually create that quote. So let's create a quote.
Agent: In this time, let's do it for Professional liability. We'll take a quote, let's do a new quote. We'll pick the quote type, straight quote. I'll just put a quick placeholder in here.
Agent: I'm going to call this PEL Live, so Professional liability I quote, these others we can require from your business. I'm just going to put this as a placeholder for the demo.
Agent: Now I land on the quote record and I can begin to manage every aspect of this quote record. The very first thing being I need to add a product.
Agent: Well, what product is it?
Agent: We saw general liability earlier from [ORG-38], his [PERSON-33] T2. Well, we talked about Professional liability, so let's add that into this quote. The system will bring that quote and all of the coverages into my quote.
Agent: You can see the price is zero because I haven't entered or configured. the parameters necessary for the rating to take place. So I would choose the state, again, proper attributes needed to do the quoting process.
Agent: I'd choose the date the business started, we'll just select the date. You can see different controls here, whether they're drop downs, radio button, dates, sliders, all very configurable.
Agent: And that's where we'd like to have a future workshop to show you exactly how to do this and how flexible this process is. So I'll set a few of these and then I'll click rate.
Agent: Now, the application is looking directly at that product we talked about, joining the migrating engine and bringing all the way back through and giving me a rate for this Professional liability.
Agent: So we've gone all the way through the process. Now, I've got it quoted. Underwriting decision is here because I'm in the draft status.
Agent: That means that because I'm only in draft status, if I execute this guided process, it's going to make sure that I don't have any exceptions on this quote. And I don't have any exceptions on this quote.
Agent: I don't have any exceptions because I didn't write any rules to create exceptions. These exceptions would be like your carrier exceptions. Maybe they only want one million in risk.
Agent: And if it goes over a million, you would write an exception so that your producer needs to work with them and sort out the specifics.
Agent: Or maybe you have eligibility that it's at 1.0 and then they don't want any part of it. No appetite for that. So we would just take that product out if it's over 1.5 million.
Agent: So you've got those eligibility rules. You've got those exception rules. And then furthermore, if we write this into a quoted status, we're going to see that a rules log pops up and we didn't violate any rules.
Agent: So we can do verification and validation that things are in good order as we move from one business status to the next status. The idea would be that this is quoted.
Agent: I'm going to refresh my screen and under guided flows, you'll see under ready decision does not apply to a quoted quote.
Agent: Now I've got the ability to just directly issue the policy because we've already ran those checks to make sure that we don't have any violations or exceptions.
Agent: So now when I issue this policy, again, a guided process to do the work for you.
Agent: Do you want to set up a new payment plan?
Agent: I'll choose no for the speed of the time [DATE-9]. And then. It indicates and it knows that I've got a root risk policy in place.
Agent: So would I like to associate this to that root risk and put this under there?
Agent: Yes, I would. And I can choose which policies those are. I only have one right now. So I'll choose this RP 843. This is going from a quote. It's moving forward and binding that policy.
Agent: It's also associating that to that root risk. And then we'll get a simple confirmation that has been created. So I've got confirmation of that policy. Now if I come back to my risk policy.
Agent: And I've got my risk lawyers here. We see eight items. If I refresh that, I think I deleted one. There's the item there, my safety sign.
Agent: So if I drill into it, there's the one we created and our Professional liability.
Agent: And so we've gone now from email submission, quoting via email submission to get a process, a broker quoting via the broker portal, going through the claim.
Agent: Process, looking at that program and those multi-tiered policies, as well as then we took a look at the product, the rating, and then we came in and we actually did a quote through what we call the lightning experience where you would manually enter the information.
Agent: And with that, that's really what I wanted to show for [DATE-10]. Like I said, that's kind of the speed round of things.
Agent: [PERSON-17], what are your thoughts on that approach of going through the quote rate bind and then taking a moment and showing them the flexibility of product configuration to show how quickly they could bring those products to market and for their various programs?
EndUser: Yeah, I like it. Thank you very much.
Agent: Yeah, is that kind of what you're thinking for the like the day in the life of the usability, but then the flexibility?
EndUser: Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Okay.
Agent: And one area that we can touch on if we have time was as these quotes, opportunities come in, they can be managed in multiple currencies too, right?
Agent: So if I were to need to do another different Opportunity and quote and I just simply use a different price book. So if we look at Let's see. Let's go back to my home page.
Agent: That's the home pages is valuable because it gives me everything I need to see right so if I go back to my home page and we have submissions then we've got an opportunity down here we put the conversion ratio right within the multi-currency of the system and it's going to convert that so this one done in <inaudible> replay So it's just simply same product different price book based on that conversion factor.
Agent: So based on where it is, what country it is, then we can do those conversions and we can manage that process the same as what we just walked through. And then system automation too.
Agent: So I've got a scenario can where maybe on an opportunity or a quote, a quote has a certain status and people need to be notified.
Agent: So through integration, in the case it's [NORP-1], it would send a message out through maybe some [ORG-10] users and notify them.
Agent: Or if the status changes, then it would need to send out to [ORG-38] users and it would notify the Teams users of certain status or a certain updates.
Agent: And even to the point of if that message goes out and it fails, then the system knows it failed.
Agent: So let's go ahead and log the fact that it failed, create a task for the system administrator to go look at the connection and the system begins to manage itself so that as a producer, I see, oh, something went wrong, I need to call, can and say, can go fix this or can get one of your guys to fix this, the system would just create a task for you and need to be notified.
Agent: So it's just saving time all around. And again, getting things in the right key with the right time to work on more quickly without all the admin overhead.
EndUser: Yep, makes sense. I. I guess I know it's more of a timing issue, but while it's good to see like the currency think that one, at least for us, isn't necessarily required.
EndUser: So if it comes a timing issue, then definitely don't need to include that. But definitely was good to have that like the tasks and things like that.
EndUser: Did you were bringing up?
EndUser: Yeah. Okay. No good to know because I'm sure time will be an issue because
Agent: It's just easier to talk live and with multiple people and questions, we want to make sure and fill the questions. So if that's not important, we'll just, I'll leave it out.
Agent: And then if we need to come back to it at some point, we can always come back to it. No big deal. Perfect, I appreciate it, thank you. Yep. So that's what I had on Q for things.
Agent: Yeah, good. And then we're just going to wrap up with, you know, getting your, Agreement and consideration to move forward on the workshop approach can so.
Agent: And then any other questions as it come up as far as might be on the parking lot so. That's kind of the flow for [DATE-16] on [DATE-1] and.
Agent: I'll send over the zoom to [PERSON-24] and if you guys will let me know who the other. Attendees are that would be great and will be there in person as we discussed.
EndUser: Okay sounds good. Thank you very much. Looks good. Thank you very much. Have a great one. Okay. Bye.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are the questions they asked:

1. ""What's been negotiated recently with [PERSON-2]. So are the discounts holistic, meaning all the divisions combined or per division? How does that work?""
2. ""You know, our goal is not only to do this presentation, but come back and do the executive readout. So, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll have you meet [PERSON-10] in a different time.""
3. ""What I'm trying to get ahead of, if you will, is if we have answers to all those things, we need to talk about before you have our RDS, maybe take a scenario, and actually show how [DATE-10] in the life would actually happen.""
4. ""I would prefer to have more of a demonstration rather than talking on this primarily to avoid this is a technology decision.""
5. ""How would that happen? What kind of time is going to be needed from my producers and a lot of people in [ORG-2] can visualize [DATE-10] in the life, but there's only a few people that can visualize, hey, where do we need to go, if that makes sense.""
6. ""You would go about that and how you would go about that. You would approach it because niblitz is the way to go with this team. You do days and day s on it . they kind of lose focus.""
7. ""I may add a slide then that hits those key points then. Just so it just adds an informative so that they walk away having a good understanding of how this could work.""
8. ""What do you think of the first the first few bites or the first few looks for the audience on [DATE-1] to see?""
9. ""What would you refer to that individual as? Is that a producer?""

They specifically mentioned that the product meets their day-to-day needs and their digital strategy, and that it works for their business from single products to complex programs and commercial.

However, they did mention that they need to go through workshops to ensure that the product meets their needs in specific areas and to estimate the implementation cost.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer: The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs in the following areas:

1. Discount structure: The customer asked whether the discounts are holistic (for all divisions combined) or per division. The sales rep didn't provide a clear answer, and this could be an opportunity to better understand the customer's requirements and provide a tailored solution.

2. Integration with [ORG-14]: The customer mentioned that [ORG-14] has not been as excited to do a proof of concept with them for data integration. The sales rep could have spent more time discussing this challenge, understanding the customer's concerns, and proposing potential solutions.

3. Accounting and billing: The customer expressed interest in understanding the accounting and billing process within the proposed solution. While the sales rep briefly touched upon this topic, they could have delved deeper to address the customer's concerns and provide more clarity.

4. [ORG-16] partner involvement: The customer mentioned the need for an [ORG-16] partner to help with integration and building specific components. The sales rep could have spent more time discussing the potential costs and timeline associated with this partnership, as well as exploring any potential concerns the customer might have.

If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or who the correct person would be if they were not. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The seller and customer discuss various aspects of the seller's product and potential implementation, but no clear decisions or next steps are outlined.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""Does [ORG-3] meet the day-to-day needs? So does this meet the digital strategy? Is this a service platform that works for [ORG-2] and its needs all the way through from the single business to the complex programs and commercial?""

The customer seemed more engaged after this question as they started discussing the workshops to understand the capabilities and requirements in detail.

2. ""Does the platform overall, all the pieces that have been talked about really allow for a transformation to move the [ORG-2] onto this platform and sunset some of the technology, modify the processes to be more effective going forward. And allow for the ability to add capabilities and grow for [ORG-2] as it continues to grow?""

* The sales rep also mentioned that the sales rep's company is not beholden to a single source vendor or a limited number of resources for customization and changes, unlike some of these other traditional software type black box approaches.

Question: Were there any blockers or concerns mentioned by the customer that could prevent closing the deal?

* There were a few blockers or concerns mentioned by the customer that could prevent closing the deal. One concern was the integration with [PERSON-21] and the cost of that integration. The customer also mentioned the need to understand the level of effort and cost for the implementation, as well as the need to ensure that the platform meets the day-to-day needs and allows for a transformation to move the organization onto the platform.
* Additionally, the customer mentioned the need to align the solution with the technical needs and goals of the organization, and the need to make sure that the solution meets the digital strategy and is a service platform that works for the organization's needs.

video_19788_167_6qr3y000000g2A7AAI,"Agent: So, just to set up a little bit of context, so me and [PERSON-1] had a brief discussion on how [ORG-1] could help [PERSON-2] restaurant chain in general and of course the other brands as and when we go through this partnership.
Agent: Now we identified that there were two products which were of key relevance for [PERSON-2] restaurant.
Agent: One is engagement and [GPE-1], but we drill down that engagement should be the first level of, you know, the product that [PERSON-2] restaurant should look at in terms of improving the engagement that they have with customer.
Agent: Now to give you a quick context, [PERSON-3] on the product itself, what that product does is basically it helps you send very personalized email SMS and WhatsApp and also [ORG-2] goes customers want social media and various trigger points .
Agent: Example, someone added something to the car t and they did not buy it, right ?
Agent: Do you nudge that customer to actually make a purchase ?
Agent: Someone is constantly coming to your restaurant , do you upsell, cross-sell those customers ?
Agent: Do you make sure that they keep coming bac k to your restaurant ?
Agent: Right?
Agent: So [DATE-1] I have on the call [PERSON-4] with me. She is the lead solution engineer.
Agent: She will be the one who will be conducting [DATE-1]'s session in terms of taking you through few of the use cases, the look and feel of the platform and how exactly, you know, [PERSON-2] restaurant will be able to leverage this platform.
Agent: It would be a very personalized demo.
Agent: Having said that, I would love if you guys interact, ask as many questions as possible, feel free to interrupt us and keep asking the use cases or whatever comes in top of your mind. So I hope that's okay.
Agent: The agenda is okay with both of you guys. Yeah.
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: Great. Now
Agent: With that, I will just hand it over to [PERSON-4] to begin our session. Over to you, [PERSON-4]. Sure.
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-4]. So with that, I will start sharing my screen. Please do let me know once it is visible to you.
EndUser: Yeah,
Speaker 6: We can see now.
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: So just before
Agent: We begin the [DATE-1] session, just a quick forward looking statement from [PERSON-5] that all your purchasing decision should be made on the basis of a current corrupting capabilities because we are a publicly traded company.
Agent: And we would like to thank you and [PERSON-6] Sir for sparing time out of your busy schedules and we hope we make a valuable use of your time to live with us.
Agent: Just a quick glimpse of what we'll cover in [DATE-2]. Although [PERSON-7] is already spoken about the different solutions, which are a fitment for the project group.
Agent: With that, I'll just provide a little bit of introduction of the solution that we are proposing. Our understanding of the key areas or objectives that we've gathered from the last call.
Agent: Based on that, what is the three defined customer journey that we bring on the table?
Agent: And also... followed by a product demonstration on how easy it is to stitch all of this together how you can create those one-to-one customer experiences, right, in order t o redefine their journey.
Agent: And then we can talk about some of the customers we are working wit h within your industry and the next steps as well . So just a quick look at our rating.
Agent: We are in rated number one in sales service, [PRODUCT-1] and Marketing platform. These are some of the key logos that we are working with within [GPE-2]. Again, this is a very small snapshot.
Agent: Globally, again, this is a huge proof for printings, especially in terms of food and beverages industry. We are working with [ORG-3] and the working with [ORG-4] and we are working with [PERSON-8], so these site.
EndUser: Are some of the key clients we need to be in this industry.
Agent: I wish you just a second, but you mentioned you are working with [ORG-5], I'll have to not.
EndUser: As well in [GPE-3].
EndUser: Share some of that. No, you mentioned some name right, you just know you're [ORG-6] are in [GPE-2].
Agent: Oh, [ORG-6] are in [GPE-2], okay, okay. So in [ORG-4], essentially they're using a wider a [PRODUCT-2] of [ORG-1] products
EndUser: And just take [TIME-1] to talk about some of the use cases they are trying to do. Right, so in terms of... Any [ORG-7], any one
Agent: Of the logos what you have, anyone is in a food and beverages industry?
Agent: Yes, we do have a lot of as well and global as well.
EndUser: In [GPE-2]
Agent: [PERSON-9] is basically a cinema as you know, in [GPE-2] and essentially some of the use cases they are trying to solve is around the food and beverages.
Agent: So in case you like cheese popcorn, the notch that they are going to send you is basis on you know, it's a cheese popcorn with a you know [ORG-8] combo, right.
Agent: So it creates those affinities, propensities on what you are likely to order and then serve those marketed messages according to you. Again, this is over.
Agent: Wider sales force product use case but these are some of the use cases they are tryin g to solve In terms of food and [PERSON-10] while I want you to cover it at the end but I'll just [PERSON-13] e a minute here So we're working with bitties and boughs This is [GPE-4] and also a [GPE-5] coffee chain that we are working with .
Agent: Again, you can see the amount of impact that we've made. We've made emails of which response time we affected them. There was also an increase in use that are signups.
Agent: They also reduced a lot of time in customer segmentation and creating those Marketing campaigns on a very personalized one-to-one on a scale level. So this is one of the use cases. Then we're also working with [GPE-6] wide-wings.
Agent: This is again a global use case that we have. They wanted to send a lot of push notifications.
Agent: So with [ORG-1] Marketing cloud, you get all the channels on one single platform, whic h is your email, SMS, WhatsApp, or push And the key use cases were around push So with redefining all those customer journeys, different touch points, they were able t o see a lot of significant impact in their Marketing ROI as well as create those campaigns o n a very far, with the various small effort But you don't have to navigate between teams or teams here and there for just getting the segments or the creative.
Agent: You can do everything on one single platform. Then we're also working with [PERSON-15] as a whole group. And then this case is as well. Again, this is a wider story of [ORG-1], Marketing and [GPE-1] platform.
EndUser: Cloud engagement
Agent: Here, this is a pizza chain based out of [GPE-4].
Agent: For them, some of the key use cases that they wanted to solve was that, are you liking as an individual, right?
Agent: Ankithma prefer a [ORG-9] pizza. And the [ORG-10], in case you are a vegetarian, you may prefer a pizza with pizza.
Agent: The [ORG-13] and Olives So having those insights for each and every user they were able to send those segmented very relevant on e to one hyper-personalized messages to you thereb y in creating the impact in your customer
EndUser: Ecosystem by increasing the ROI and thereby [PERSON-15] the personalized messages as well .
Agent: Got it.
Agent: So moving back to the beginning of the use case.
Agent: So essentially, in [ORG-1], what we envision as a customer experience or a successful customer experience is by keeping your customer at the center and thinking about all the different touch points he may have within your ecosystem.
Agent: Now that could be a [ORG-15], that could be a service platform where a person is making an inquiry or has some consumer complaints and thereby or complementing it with the Marketing ecosystem or the Marketing solutions where you can send all the different questions.
Agent: On the channel log just to your end consumers .
Agent: ?
Agent: Within [DATE-1]'s session, the scope of the demonstratio n we have kept is just the engagement platform , is the only channel platform where you can creat e or stitch consumer journeys and send thos e only channel log just on email SMS .
Agent: Up ?
Agent: Them via . [ORG-15], [ORG-15], [ORG-17], [ORG-15], [ORG-15], [PERSON-15], etc. Again, with engagement, the advertising that I spoke about, we have native connectivity with these different social platforms.
Agent: [PERSON-17] is the platform where if you want to create, let's say, a propensity of a person to buy, or if you want to create, you know, create segments which touches across various touch points of a customer.
Agent: For example, somebody is looking at the website. He has not purchased any previous orders from the end-your-group in the past.
Agent: Or is his propensity or what he ordered last time or the number of orders that he did last time on [NORP-1] were greater than two.
Agent: So in case you want to do those sophisticated use cases, then that is where customer data platform comes into picture. This is the one that is used by [ORG-4] and [GPE-7].
Agent: I think there's somebody who raised his hand .
Speaker 6: At the moment so [PERSON-15] when you say you have a native connectivity with the social media, what is the difference between a native connectivity and the normal connectivity?
Agent: Yeah,
Speaker 6: I mean, can we schedule our calendars and the automated postings can be done via this platform?
Agent: So what I mean by native connectivity is that for For example, you have a segment of people.
Agent: Let's say one of the use cases that I look at from the previous conversation, [PERSON-15] that you highlighted was, let's say an abandoned use case.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Somebody who abandoned a cart or people or another example could be that if you want to drive a significant traffic towards online delivery, right?
Agent: People who visited your restaurant in [DATE-3], maybe you want that, but you want to serve a act to those particular people.
Agent: Now, you can either send an email, you can send an SMS, what's up, or you can send them an [ORG-15].
Agent: Now, what that native connectivity allows you to do is that from this platform itself, you can take that segment and publish that.
Agent: Segment and that will be available on your social media and then you can define the creativ e and send that targeted act to those people.
Agent: What happens when you don't have a nativ e connectivity?
Agent: You will manually have to extract that segment in a file, then import it manuall y within your social ecosystem. And as the social ecosystem also increases the amount of huma n effort at your end .
Speaker 6: I hope that clarifies your question.
Agent: Yeah, so case of native also, I the social posting, the post and all I have to do.
EndUser: But still in
Speaker 6: Have to do
Agent: Man, right?
Agent: Yeah, I'm just a quick intervention here. So campaigns, creating campaigns, all of that will still happen at the respective platforms.
Speaker 6: All your social building campaigns,
Agent: I mean, well, please go because that's
EndUser: Their bread and butter. But are I also pushing
Agent: The audience whom that campaign that
Speaker 6: Do you want to show
Agent: Can be automated using a platform that can be mapped the mapping of the customer segmentation. Additional use case which are forcing your industries. Let's say you want to suppress a couple of people as well.
Agent: Maybe you're driving an awareness campaign and some people who have already visited your restaurant in [DATE-4]. Maybe you want to add a suppression audience on your ad campaign.
Speaker 6: That could be one key view. use case where you can effectively optimise
Agent: Your Marketing that spend as well . right okay
Agent: So, I'll keep moving on. We have a constant engagement, which is a [ORG-23] So, I'll ignore this one. In case you want to personalize your, let's say, digital properties, for example, somebody plans on your website.
Agent: You want to nudge them by giving them a relevant offer by what providing a [ORG-15] information, let's say, email or an SMS.
Agent: So, in defining those pop-ups or if somebody's looking at a [NORP-1] food or let's say he's looking at a restaurant and let's say he's looking at an area of cinema.
Agent: Before then customizing or personalizing those digital experiences is powered by personalization .
Agent: Case you're spending too much on your ads, right?
Agent: And you do not know which ads are drivin g the best performance then intelligence comes into picture.
Agent: If you want to create let's sa y different tiers of your loyalty program, define that in this platinum tier, I want to give the m these many points or on birthday, this is the offer I want to roll out to them.
Agent: So again , have a loyalty experience .
Agent: The idea is that while you can start with an engagement module and all of these are modular in natur e, but going forward as you scale, as your use case is also become way more sophisticated and complicate d, you don't have to go to another vendor, we are of all your Marketing CRM service need s.
EndUser: There for you, we'll take care
Agent: Okay, so with that I will delve right into the you know presentation.
Agent: So a couple of things what we have observed in terms of 10s is that, you know, of course, there are, while there are nudges that go to a lot of consumers in terms of email, SMS and what is up, they need to stay on the mind and not on the inbox itself.
Agent: So if somebody is looking at, let's say, [NORP-1] food and a message is going to him for a, you know, a wife, nami food, that may not resonate with your customers.
Agent: And we've seen a lot of brands struggling with that.
Agent: And that this is something which typically, happens when you take an email from another vendor, SMS from another vendo r and [ORG-21] from another vendor, right ?
Agent: You can see, silo channel is one of the common problems . then, you know, because your data is not, you know , moving between these channels, your email may tend t o communicate a very different message .
Agent: Sms may have a very different communication as well, right ?
Agent: That's the need for that same need of the are having all th e all the Marketing channels on one single platform .
Agent: With that in mind, would be also o n understood from you, you do want to look at how you can acquire your customers, keep existi ng ones, you know, engaged with your brand, how can you create highly personalized experienc es on scale on a one two one basis and thereby increasing your customer lifetime value a nd also having that impact of increase in the Marketing ROI within your ecosystem.
Agent: Now in order to solve for all these challenges, we propose a [PRODUCT-3] engagement solution. Now what it does for you is that you can import all your consumer data. You can create different segments on those people.
Agent: You can send those one-to-one personalized journeys. You can send emails, SMS, WhatsApp, or G-target them via channels. And as you can see on the right side, this is how a sample journey may look like for your customers.
Agent: And with that being said, this is very, very customizable. You can define your own customer journeys. You can define your own touch points. You can add different if-and-else conditions within your Marketing journeys.
Agent: Now in order to effectively look at how we are going to impact our customer journey, we're looking at, we are going to step into the shoes of [ORG-15] and she's a prospective customer.
Agent: Right now her wedding anniversary is about to come and she wants to celebrate it at a, you know, one of the pre-membré restaurants and she's currently in her in her browsing order. search state.
Agent: And at the back end, in order to ensure that [ORG-23] goes ahead and does that reservation with [ORG-21] and also increase our customer lifetime value, we have [PERSON-23] who is a very enthusiastic marketer who connects her entire journey through relevant [WORK_OF_ART-1] and again thereby drive higher customer lifetime value for her.
Agent: Now, one of the key use cases that are picked up is increasing customer loyalty whereby Sicha [DATE-5] randomly browsing over social media, she comes across the ad of [GPE-8].
Agent: Now what she does is she that acts Intrigues or so she clicks it looks at the restaurant and what are the dishes served at [ORG-21] group now what she does is she does send an inquiry and speaks to an agent but again we all live in a varied in a world which is full of digital restrictions, right?
Agent: Maybe our mothers are calling to check out a day go or, you know, our dogs are barking or our kids are calling us for something or the other, right?
Agent: So at this point of time, what you can do is retarget her with some only general communication. Maybe send an email or an SMS or a WhatsApp at this point of time.
Agent: In case she's not responsive on any of these channels, she's still not done a booking. Then you can retarget her via ads to not her further.
Agent: So, on [PERSON-15] here again, this is a very common use case that we got implemented for a lo t of key appliances For example, your email SMS and WhatsApp are comparatively cheaper and ads are comparativel y much more expensive start using email SMS and WhatsApp in the first go If there is no response, then you can go ahead and proceed to your ads as well .
Speaker 6: So you can Right?
Agent: Then you can go ahead, then she goes ahead and does a booking and at this point of time you can do a purchase, confirmation and recommendations or preferences, capture preferences for her even before she visits your restaurant.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Now on [DATE-6] of her appointment, all the reminders that are going on, timely reminders and then after her visit, maybe a post-visit feedback on how did, how was everything for her was everything in line with her expectation.
Agent: And then you can also keep her informed about different seasonal festival offers going on or the new restaurant launches that are happening group or the new dishes that are being launched.
Speaker 6: With the ninja
Agent: So the second use case that I've picked up is that is the driving online delivery sales whereby somebody is an existing customer. You can keep them informed about you know there's an online delivery section as well right.
Agent: This could be before people who have already you know done an online delivery from you in the past or people who have visited your restaurant and not made an online purchase right so what she does is as an end user she again goes to the website a [PERSON-21]'s in drop-off drops off at this point of time you can send them an SMS or a WhatsApp with an offer let's say you know welcome tent or seasonal 10 offer could be promo [LAW-1] can be given so that they can go ahead and make the purchase.
Agent: So she goes ahead and makes that purchase and this point of time you can trigger different purchase communications via only channels and then you can also keep them notified about different seasonal festival offers or food festival offers going on within your ecosystem.
Agent: That's a <inaudible> [EVENT-1] is about to come so you can keep what special are you doing within [DATE-7].
EndUser: Them informed about
Speaker 6: What is
Agent: So these are some of the key use cases that you can look at, but again, number of use cases that you can define are limitless, right?
Speaker 6: The
Agent: And all of them can be done with these particular lifecycle journeys that you can see here.
Agent: So Some of the journeys you can run for different consumer life cycle phases is during their awareness phase, their conversion, their onboarding engagement and the retention. So with that, I'll jump right
Speaker 6: Into the platform and just want to see in case you on a land resort, if you have any questions from me.
Speaker 6: Yeah, so at this stage, I have a question that regarding this use case says, for example, you gave these two examples. I wanted to understand how flexible is your system.
EndUser: That if I have a use case in my mind, so I can define that rule for the segmentation that flexibility is there, or I have to just follow the predefined set of rules which you have created for the segmentation and the filtration part.
Agent: Okay, there are so you know as you can see we work with a lot of Industries as well.
Agent: They have different use cases, right?
Agent: So the whole idea what [ORG-1] does is we give you a platform to play with right?
Agent: You can define your use cases. You can stitch your own journeys. It is very flexible and in terms of ease [GPE-9]. Have you played that Right, right.
Speaker 6: Game of legos when we were young?
Agent: Right. So it's as easy as that. And you are we are actually going to see how easy it is to create those journeys as well, which I'll actually, you
Speaker 6: Know, show it to your [TIME-2].
EndUser: Okay, [PERSON-15] and tell me one thing that whatever is the use cases, assume that we are not doing anything. We are not posting anything on our social medias or we are not running any ad.
EndUser: Will, will this system still works?
EndUser: So we just have on website and we Right after that, if we are not at all active, say for [DATE-8], we have zero, zero ads running either on social media or on [ORG-17] ads, or not a single post on any of our social media as assets handles.
Agent: Have in social media presence.
Agent: What will happen?
Agent: So essentially that is just one of the touch points that we have that you know one of the entry points that you can take from social media regardless of whether that traffic comes from social media or not you just need let's say a PII information for a you know end consumer if [NORP-2] sir if I want to reach out to you right like I need to know your phone number on this you know an email address for me being able to reach out to you.
Agent: So in case let's say another use case or an entry point would be that in your end consumer.
Agent: Restaurant itself, there's somebody who's capturing my phone number or an email A little bit, then you can create these your needs as well . Okay, we could somebody lose their hand.
EndUser: Got it.
Agent: I
Agent: No, I wish it was me only in country. Okay.
Agent: So with that, [PERSON-23], sir, and [PERSON-1], I will jump right onto the platform and we'll see how easy it is to create and stitch those journeys, right?
Agent: So this is the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Platform and this also summarizes the key capabilities within the platform itself, right?
Agent: So if you see here in [DATE-9], there are a couple of studios and there are a couple of builders. Now these studios are essentially the different channels via which you can reach your yoke in consumers.
Agent: That's your email. SMS, WhatsApp, different ad channels and also if you want to create any inquiry pages . these are these [NORP-3] different channels by which you can reach out your end consumers .
Agent: [ORG-15] is where we are going to create those one-on-one customer journeys and those if and students.
Agent: If you want to see reporting, then again those that are provided by the analytics and then you can create your WhatsApp email Content again within the platform.
Agent: And [PERSON-21], just like a super brainy scientist [PERSON-21], we have embedded AI within the platform which you can again use within your customer journeys.
Agent: And [PERSON-21]'s are also extending on the you know the previous query that you just asked that. you know another touch point could be using the inquiry pages.
Agent: So in case you do not hav e you do not do any social media targeting right and you have organic traffic flowing ont o your website.
Agent: If you want to create let's send and quiet page a first name last nam e what restaurant what day do you want to visit again you can create those these landing page s on the platform and host them within your website where once any you know once [PERSON-15] or aruship would that information like an email or an essay is you can use that information and start a lead nurturing journey for these particul ar people.
Agent: This is again just one sample cloud landing page. You can customize it, you c an add different attributes, you can add a different look and feel to it altogether as [PERSON-38] 6: So, [PERSON-4], here I understand that this
Agent: Is a Marketing engagement
EndUser: Platform which you are showing right now. Assuming that I have a system where I am doing my table reservation, people are doing the
Agent: Bookings there and
Speaker 6: I am getting the booking data in my back-hand system. So that system will be integrated
Agent: To this platform on a real-time basis, how it will So there are two ways of integration. So with [ORG-1], we are a very open ecosystem.
Agent: If you have a need to nurture some real-time information, not to go to those real-time journeys, we do have open APIs.
Agent: So as long as your source system can trigger an API call, we are able to receive it, we are able to handle it, and you can create a journey. That is one way.
Agent: In case you feel that API is not, let's say, on your source, there's a restriction on the API.
Agent: You can, let's say, export a flat file from there, put it in the SFTP and says , is very well capable of picking up files from the SFT P on a regular basis,
Agent: Thereby automating your entire process . So, in layman's term, yes, it can be in real-time if it is through API integration, if your system
Speaker 6: Allows API, then this can be integrated and it can be real time.
Agent: Got it, the real-time as well as the manual process of file based transfer.
Speaker 6: Got it. So, we have both the options, have a lot of data.
Agent: Correct, correct. Okay. So, we
Speaker 6: So, we have a lot of data. So, we have a lot of data. So, we have a lot of data. So, we have a
Agent: Lot of data. So, we have a lot of data. So I'm considering what elaborating on your question, how easy it is to create journeys or stitching those journeys.
Agent: We also, you know, now you can see there are a couple of, you know, symbols on the left side and on the right side, I have a white canvas, right?
Agent: Now we just go to in the game of legos.
Agent: What do we do?
Agent: We have different blocks. We have green color, yellow color. red and blue. You can see different colours. All you need to do is drag and drop them and configure your journeys.
Agent: Now also answering upon your what all data sources we can look at.
Agent: One could be you already have some existing customers, right?
Agent: You want to send an urgent journey to so you can use a data extension activity. In case you already have a booking system, you want to do some real-time journeys. A pair event can be used for that.
Agent: In case you have any of you want to nurture people who have sent in [ORG-38]-D on your website and in [ORG-38]-E form, which is looked at [TIME-3] back, you can utilize the cloud pages activity.
Agent: So the options are limitless. All you need to do is, you know, just identify where your source data is like. who you want to send a journey to.
Agent: So for the sake of the session, I'm just using a data extension activity.
EndUser: Next So this configuration of the journey is taken care by your team or my team.
Agent: Would be that.
Agent: So this configuration of the journey essentially again, all you need to do is identify the use cases that you want And there'll be a one-time Implementation that will be done, you know, after you sign up for this instance, wherein our Implementation partner will come in, they will do an extensive discovery for you that, you know, these are the [PERSON-1] and [ORG-21], so these are the use cases that you want to do.
Speaker 6: To do, right?
Agent: From their experience also, they will act as advisory that in this industry, these are some additional use case s that we are seeing or from a different industry , some use cases, which may be very relevan t for your industry .
Agent: Is what you can also start experimenting with . they can also guide you in that particular way . they'll set these journeys up for you . set up these different data Integration point s as well .
Agent: Then on an operational level , and until you want to change a creativ e or you want to add more journeys , then majorly I've seen customers getting into the platfor m.
Speaker 6: Okay, okay.
Agent: So then on kit let's say you want to send an email WhatsApp.
Agent: Or an SMS, right?
Agent: And then let's say an ad campaign as well, to, on maybe [ORG-17] or [ORG-15], right?
Agent: One of the use cases could be that you may want to add a decision that maybe somebody is looking at a restaurant in Little [GPE-2] whereas somebody who is looking at a restaurant in another location of [GPE-3] or [GPE-2] or you know, [GPE-10] or [GPE-13], right?
Agent: So this decision let essentially acts as an if and else condition within your Marketing journeys there by helping you to effectively segment your consumer database.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Then you can also utilize this engagement with activity. Now essentially what this helps you to do is that in case somebody has opened this email, maybe you can continue nurturing them on email.
Agent: If they have not, then maybe you can send them a WhatsApp. Now this effectively helps you in optimizing your Marketing spend because email is the most cheapest form of channel.
Agent: Whatsapp costs a little more and if you add ads, right?
Agent: Add is the most expensive form of channels. So you can optimize your... Marketing spend as well from here . In case you want to increase your email engagement rate, you can utilize [PERSON-21] as well.
Agent: Now, here what happens is that, for example, [PERSON-26] are open his emails at [TIME-4], and [ORG-26], you generally check to prefer in the afternoon, maybe around 1am, right?
Agent: So while you both are a part of this segment, this email will land in the [ORG-21]'s inbox at [TIME-4] when he has previously engaged with a brand. And in your inbox at [TIME-5]Agent: When you have engaged with a brand on a one two one level right if I'm an [PERSON-21] also added even ou r Preferences will be added in this journe y Then you can also utilize this frequency split now your what also does happen o r What is also very common in the Marketing world is that there are too many Marketing messages sent t o You know your end consumers if you want to define that saturation that if so many messages have gone t o If too many messages have [NORP-4] t to you [PERSON-26] a particular individual, if you want to end their journey, if not, then maybe you want to continue their journey.
Agent: So for that frequency spec is used. And then if you want to utilize the likelihood of a person to open this particular channel, even before sending that Marketing communication, then you can also utilize this scoring split.
Agent: What is the likelihood of this person opening an email?
Agent: What is there a likelihood?
Agent: If there's a likelihood, then you send them an email. If not, then maybe you can move them on a WhatsApp or, you know, Noise detection . So, here you can just see a user email open state.
Agent: So here if something is likely to open an email, send them an email. If he's not likely to open an email, send them a WhatsApp or an [ORG-15] or an SMS. So you can effectively do those these things.
Agent: And, what you may have noticed still now is I've not written even a single line of [PRODUCT-4] or [ORG-26] or any code. It is a drag and drop query that I'm doing.
Agent: And in future, if you think there's a need for you to, let's say, user sales for [PRODUCT-1] or a service cloud, then you also have native connectivity with these platforms if you want to create a need for somebody to call up, you know, for a sales agent to pursue or you want to create a task for a service agent.
Agent: So again, we have a native connectivity, but these are activated
Speaker 6: Or enabled if you do buy sales, sales, the [PRODUCT-1] or the service platform. Okay, so for this communication channels as a part of these workflows like email or a WhatsApp.
Agent: So you have your in house platforms to broadcast the data. So these are run natively on the [ORG-1] platform.
Agent: We are our own ESP and in terms of WhatsApp, we have a strategic direct partnership with meta, which means you can create your WhatsApp business account on the platform. You can create your templates as well.
Agent: You can get your approvals from the platform itself.
Agent: Also with the intermediary because again speaking to a lot of clients and a lot of client ecosystems, what happens when there's a third party, what's a provider is that there's a blame game that my templates are not getting approved or the price is also 10 to increase because every vendor in between have their own commissions.
Agent: So thereby there are advantages that we have by having that strategic partnership with [ORG-38].
EndUser: So your package is inclusive of these communication price as well, like the platforms, right?
EndUser: There's no separate charges for the transaction
Agent: Based on the number of transaction or something. [PERSON-1], the way we price our platform is again very modular in nature.
Agent: We have a base platform price, right?
Agent: And then we have a consumable price that with the place platform some emails which are bundled for free in terms of how many message, how many SMS you want to say, how many WhatsApp you want to say, which is very similar to how we used to have those, you know, mobile prepaid that there was there was a lifetime value or a and then we had a top-time price, we have value.
Speaker 6: So this is exactly how it is priced as well. Okay, understand. Okay.
Agent: So any questions on how this journey is created either from [ORG-25] or [PERSON-38] I think it's till now it's fine for me.
EndUser: Sir?
Agent: So, [ORG-26], I've created some sample journeys.
Agent: Again, this is, as you saw, that this is a very customizable tool, right?
Agent: You don't have to follow the use cases exactly that I'm showing. You can create your own journeys. You can create your use cases and it is very easy to define these journeys on the basis of use cases.
Agent: The first use case that I've taken is somebody who comes on a website and abandons this card. At this point of time, what you can do is you can send an offer-based [ORG-21] or an offer-based email.
Agent: And then you can see in... case after a while again this is customized into th e way in case after a while person has made a purchase or not .
Agent: He's already made a purchase end his journey if he is not , you can send him other recommendations or other [ORG-25] n Code right and in case not then you can .
Agent: In case there's any other offer that is relevant for that particular person or any other recommendations that are there.
Agent: If you still want to do further nurturing, maybe you can send in targeted ad campaign to those people as well.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: And we will have all those typical statistics of the email email, right?
Speaker 6: Like open rate and click rate and all those things will be there, right?
Agent: Yes, that will be there.
Agent: The second one is the second journey that I have is let's say you want to keep people informed about the festival offer or New additions that you are doing within your menu now here You can see that in case somebody has an interest of let's say [PERSON-25] Then you can send them an [NORP-1] specific Email in case you want to keep them informed that you know there's a new addition Let's say you add some [GPE-15] you will run dishes within your menu like a kachapa or anarapa right so you can confirm them that you know these are new additions that we are doing or in terms of there's a new restaurant launch as well so that's another use case that you can look at that you know the previous maybe you also want to keep them informed that there's a new branch opening and this area of the city as well right yeah Right?
Speaker 6: Customers who visited this restaurant
Agent: And then you can also do path, you know, AB testing in terms of if you want to test different creatives right on your email, which whichever is having a higher open or an engagement rate that goes out to the remaining audience.
Agent: For example, if you have 102 people to 10 you send a version A to 10 you send a version B after a while you check out of version A and version B, which was the winning creative and then to 62 people
Speaker 6: The winning creative course. So you can do those.
Agent: You know, those you can also explore these features within the tool .
EndUser: Right, right, right. So coming to the creative, sorry, I was there a question.
EndUser: I was just, I just forgot what I was about to ask.
EndUser: So my question is whatever I have seen right now, you have defined one journey and all at the starting point or some data source, right?
EndUser: That data source would be the real-time API based thing or a flat file based thing.
EndUser: Now my question is this is about, this is we are doing, we are playing with whatever customers who have consumed my service and they have profiled
Speaker 6: Now, any feature which can expose us to external people who have not consumed our audience in the open market.
Agent: Service, but they are relevant target provision?
Speaker 6: Do we have any such
Agent: Are you talking about local-like audiences?
Agent: Maybe something like that, yeah, correct. Okay, so we do have that, but that's only applicable within the [ORG-15] ecosystem, with at least in this particular platform or this particular module that we are talking about.
Agent: So we do have something known as, for example, you identified these are your high value customers in that segment, and you want, you publish that segment to [ORG-15], and then you can do a lookalike audiences as well from here.
Agent: The [GPE-1] module, if you remember that we talked about the customer data platform with a data cloud.
Agent: With that, We even have extensive partnerships with [ORG-17] platform So if you want to do local likes within [ORG-17] ecosystem that can be done They even give you insights, such as these are the peopl e who are night lovers or coffee lovers .
Agent: Or you know, like life enthusiasts or sports club fanatics. So from the [ORG-17] ecosystem, you also publish
Speaker 6: Those insights, but that is again applicable within the [GPE-1] or the Data Cloud module. So that is a totally
Agent: Kind of a paid ad kind of a thing or it is something organic also out of it.
EndUser: Paid ad paid at an organic ad as in the local likes. let's say under I take your [ORG-52] module also under my package.
EndUser: There the [ORG-17] tells me that okay based on this filter criteria, we have found these one like segmented people.
EndUser: After that, what happens?
EndUser: What do I do?
EndUser: I mean, do I have to ultimately the action is to
Agent: Go for a [ORG-17] ad paid ad campaign or your system has some other actions also on there. So essentially again, when we talk about, I'll get out.
Agent: Segregate into a couple of parts what you've asked in terms of the [ORG-15] look alike when we look at just the product that is currently in scope which is the engagement module right what it does allow you is that you know there are hundred people identify the local likes for these people now that look alike happens on the [ORG-15] ecosystem so what essentially [ORG-15] is doing is it is only defining a segment for you The pricing or the ad campaign, you know, the ads that the ad spend that has to be done is to be within the [ORG-15] ecosystem.
Agent: So here it just that customer segmentation.
Speaker 6: Helps you redefine or define Okay.
Agent: Okay. And in terms of answering your question on the [ORG-17] ecosystem, which is within the [PRODUCT-5] module, what happens with [ORG-17] or [ORG-15] or [ORG-21], there is, I believe [ORG-21] would not be much of relevance to you.
Agent: But what happens with [ORG-17] ecosystem, there is that let's say there are 113 people, that's your high value customers who have also looked at your, who have also browsed your website in [DATE-3], but not made any purchase, right?
Agent: You create that segment, you publish that segment on [ORG-17] ecosystem, it does. then share those insights with you.
Agent: Now on that you can also do a local-lik e audiences but again that just constructs a segment for you the publishing of th e ad or the pricing of how you have to do that is that is that i s something that is done directly or from your from your back right .
Speaker 6: To [ORG-17]
Agent: Because essentially this is bare
Speaker 6: Bread and butter. We just help you redefine or refine your targeting criteria. Understand the strength. So the ultimately the action is like, is going towards the paid campaigns
Agent: Ultimate action with these platforms. That's what I wanted once and think I'm fine. Yeah, please go ahead.
Agent: So it depends on your strategy in terms of I mean what we propose or what we suggest is make use of all your channels, only channel targeting which means email SMS WhatsApp where they are not effective that's a pure solely your decision.
Speaker 6: And also maybe moving to ads as well but
Agent: I want to move towards that. I got it, I got it here.
Agent: It's just that they are living in a very social world so with a lot of social presence, right?
Agent: Definitely. Yes, yes. Sorry guys, sorry to interrupt. I have another meeting I'll have to jump off.
Agent: I think [PERSON-4] can conclude the meeting and unk it once you have gone through the platform, you can give your feedback to [PERSON-4], I'll collect the same from her.
Agent: And then I'll send out a email to you asking for certain volumes
Speaker 6: Or volume metrics.
EndUser: Once you respond in the position to table the first draft of proposal with you.
Agent: To that email, that's when I'll be
EndUser: Sure, that's it. Thank you. All right. Thanks.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-1]. Thanks, [PERSON-25]. Thanks for being here. Thanks for bringing
Speaker 6: The bye-bye. Thanks for the bye-bye.
Agent: Any other questions, [PERSON-1], that I may take?
Agent: No, no, no. So you can go ahead. OK.
Agent: So, in case you can also create your [PRODUCT-6] within the platform which means let's say you can create your emails again this is something that I've created on the platform itself in case you want to let's say host any host any images or add any images within your platform let's say I can upload one of the images that I've just taken.
Agent: I think the format is not valid for this one. I just use the pre-existing one. It looks like the format does not write. So this is one image that I've already created. And I click on anything.
Agent: And then if you want to add let's say certain [WORK_OF_ART-1] within your platform, you know, text or buttons again, these are just simple drag and drops.
Agent: If you want to create if and else within your Marketing content, that if a person has previously ordered [NORP-1], maybe a picture of a pasta goes out.
Agent: If a person has ordered <inaudible> or he's a vegetarian, then vegetarian options go out as new launches in the new launch email, right?
Agent: And then you can also create email forms within the email address.
Agent: For example, a review, what was the feedback of a person?
Agent: Again, this is your customisable. You can change the fields, you can change the headers, you can change.
Agent: The look and feel you can also create a preferences within your email what is your preferred Your food are you looking at an <inaudible> are you a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?
Agent: Are you preference in <inaudible> or a [NORP-5] or a <inaudible>?
Agent: So you can create those preferences and then you can store these are also stored in the back end and then you can utilize them in your further communication is communication as well Then we also have a direct partnership with [ORG-36].
Agent: So you can create your WhatsApp business account on the platform. You can create the WhatsApp templates as well. You can create these journeys which we looked at by.
Agent: And then you can also create these sort of templates on the platform, the Marketing and the transactional ones. You can add rich media capabilities within WhatsApp images, videos, documents and also buttons.
Agent: And if you want to add first name personalization or a food personalization, what are they?
Agent: Restaurant may impose the like this and you have an upcoming appointment with restauran t at mini [GPE-2] right you can add thos e Of course, there are actually coaches, but... Now moving on to the reporting section as well.
Agent: Now even within reporting, you can get these dashboards which can show what was the again, you can redefine or refine on the basis of certain date ranges or a clamping or a journey or a business unit as well.
Agent: So another key thing that I want to highlight is that right now understand that you're looking only for a business unit, but for a for a you know, a restaurant unit, but in case actually you want to expand it to other businesses.
Agent: As well. We have the probability of creating those <inaudible> walls,
Speaker 6: Which means you can ad d different business units and create those data segregations within business units. S o we have very scalable that way . So [PERSON-4], one question here,
Agent: For example, right now
EndUser: We are a group, we are as an engine group, we are a company under which we are having multiple business units.
EndUser: So, when we purchase the account with you, we can add multiple business units under that account or we need to buy every time new account with you.
Agent: So essentially if you do plan to scale it for multiple business, you know, I'll just speak it speak on the back end with [PERSON-7] as well.
Agent: You don't need to purchase different, you know, you all you need to whenever you're signing up for a new business, you know, because that will also have their own journeys that will also have their own consumables.
Agent: So essentially you don't have to pay and you know, like a platform cost again and again, but within one single ecosystem, you can have multiple business.
EndUser: You can have different journeys, you can have different datasets, you can have differen t creatives which are also not visible to another business unit .
EndUser: Okay, I mean, and when I'm saying adding a new business unit, food domain only because for example, our [PERSON-2] brand is having four sub restaurant units under [GPE-3].
Agent: I'm talking within the
Agent: The brand the menus might be a little different and but the physical locations are different, but the brand is saving.
Speaker 6: Is same. The
Agent: Can you?
Agent: That way.
Agent: So we do give you that flexibility that if you want to create them, you know, a different business unit wise, or you can even create a folder structure and you know, within folder structure, you can organize it that way as well.
Agent: So let's say when I talk about a business unit segregation, usually the segregation that I've seen is that somebody is dealing on let's say a four-unit or you know, along with that they're also in real estate.
Agent: If you look at [ORG-37] right there, it improves so many different business units. this unit they are into, you know , there are into retail, there are into restaurants, there are
EndUser: Into multi-brant, bazaars as well. So that is the logical segregation
Agent: That I've seen. But we do review that flexibility however you want to define it. Okay.
Agent: So, on case in terms of reporting, these are some of the sample reports that you can see the open grids, you can see the cent rate, the bounce rates, you can see how the sense delivers unique open conflicts work, which journeys are performing very well for you, which journeys are not performing well for you.
Agent: So, that you can take corrective actions on these journeys. And then we also have the [PRODUCT-7] inside, so the [PRODUCT-7] dash coding capability. We summarize the [PRODUCT-7] in size space on our consumer behavior.
Agent: So you can see which all customers or which segment of your customer are opening your Marketing communications, which all are literally not opening your Marketing communications.
Agent: Then you can also see which are very engaging days within your consumer database here.
Agent: You can see the longest part of our [DATE-10] and [DATE-13], which means these are very... popular days among your consumer database, right?
Agent: If you want to see that on an R&D level So if you remember, we talked about [PERSON-52] opening his emails at [TIME-4] and you at [TIME-6] If you want to see at a holistic level, which is very popular among your consumer database you already can see the longest part is one .
Agent: So this is also something that you can be inside also something which are available within the platform. Then you can also get an understanding on how much is a saturation of marketing, communications within your consumer base.
Agent: And people receiving not enough amount of communications aren't already receiving a lot of communication. So you can end their journey. This is exactly something which we also used in the journey building module.
Agent: Then we were creating these journey, these blue activities, if you want to see those on a holistic level, that is something that we are creating. what a dashboard right now .
Agent: And then you can also get insights on which subject lines are doing well for you.
Agent: And what is the insight in terms of the emotional tone?
Agent: For example, if you have an exclamation mark, there is having a positive impact on an engagement rate. If you have love, words like, you know, love or optimism, they are having a positive impact.
Agent: If you have surprise as an element in terms of tonality, that's having a negative impact within your Marketing channel. So you can get these insights as well on an AI level. Again, these are more.
Agent: Detailed [PRODUCT-7] dashboards for your consumer database on how they are behaving on your Marketing communications Are they opening everything Are they not opening everything This is the dominant window . shop person, active subscriber and the loyal list one.
Agent: This is again on a saturation. This is again a detailed dashboard for, yeah, you can see all these insights on database.
EndUser: Your consumer
Agent: Any things from
Speaker 6: Your side on [PERSON-21] and [PERSON-36]?
Agent: It's clear. It's quite clear. Okay. Moving back to the presentation. We've already discussed about the consumer stories. So coming back to you also asked about the difference between [ORG-1] and our Competition here.
Agent: So this is what we have collated that again as you saw on [ORG-38], we on one channel you can create those omni-channel experiences, which means you can add email SMSs, WhatsApp and even retarget people via different channels.
Agent: We are not working with, you know, send grid for our emails, right?
Agent: We also have a direct native connectivity with [PRODUCT-1] or the service platform in case you do want to leverage that in future.
Agent: Usually what we have seen is that as you scale your demands also, your software needs also become more sophisticated, more complex.
Agent: So for handling those complex uses, if you ever do need a [PRODUCT-1], you don't have to go to another vendor. We have those native connectivity.
Agent: With respect to WhatsApp, we have a direct partnership with [ORG-40], which means that you can create your platforms. your WhatsApp business account and your templates within the platforms .
Agent: The [PRODUCT-7] capabilities that we have in terms of, you know, channel a person is likely to engage on the same time optimization, subject line optimization.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Again, these are natively available within the platform. You can also create different business units for different geographies or different, you know, businesses as well.
Agent: In case you have some restaurants in [GPE-2], you want to create a different [ORG-47] for it. Restaurants for [GPE-3], another business unit for it. Restaurants in [GPE-13], another business unit for it.
Agent: Then in terms of learning, we have something similar to Udemy We have [ORG-52] This is a free learning platform in case you do want to, in case you want your team want s to basically enhance your knowledge on different solutions Again, this is a free learning site that we have We do have a vast experience in food tech industry as well And again, in terms of architecture, you can create multiple business units You can do a synchronization between the same We still not provide so many things in one of thoseips to make us face ourselve s. And we do release three innovations in [DATE-15].
Agent: Within [DATE-15], we have three releases in which we keep on adding lots and lots of features every time. So this is what we,
EndUser: This is why we are superior to our Competition in the industry. And while doing all this communication to my customers, is it a pure,
Agent: Wide-label thing or sales force branding is mentioned somewhere in those communications?
Agent: We give you that capability that it goes out through your brand. So there will be a branding established for you during the Implementation phase where there will be a definition that this is coming from [GPE-15].
Agent: These are the labels, the templates that you looked at, the email template, even if you look at it. I had customized it with [GPE-15]. So it's the only customized symbol you can put your own branding.
Speaker 6: And of course, it has to be your branding. It doesn't have to be sales first branding at all.
Agent: Ok.
Agent: And in terms of why [ORG-1], again, we have a unified customer platform. We have a whole customer, in case you do want to add someday, create different loyalty programs at different tiers.
Agent: You can see we have a different solution for it. The [ORG-37] again, we have identified that as your use cases start becoming more sophisticated.
Agent: If you want to create propensities for each and every customer, combine consumer data from multiple sources, create your own game. those look alike from [ORG-17] as well.
Agent: Then we have the whole Customer329 within our ecosystem In terms of reliability and scalability, you can see we are working with some of the larges t clients like [ORG-52]. We are working with [GPE-15].
Agent: [ORG-37] also signed up with us recently. We are als o globally working with [PRODUCT-8] and we are working with [ORG-55] . So these are some key logos that we are working with in the industry.
Agent: And there's again a. built in [PRODUCT-7] as well as intelligence. We are also another key use case that we're doing within [GPE-1] right now is also related to the generator [PRODUCT-7].
Agent: So you can do natural language segmentation that get me people who visited my restaurant in [DATE-3] and have not done an online delivery. So that's something currently within [GPE-1].
Agent: But again, you've seen the whole [PRODUCT-7] as well that is embedded within the platform.
Speaker 6: So, it is the management module can be do the multi-lingual
Agent: Email communication or WhatsApp communication like in <inaudible> or so?
Speaker 6: If you can do the multi-lingual
EndUser: Communication that is there. [NORP-6] you have mentioned a very big names [ORG-55], F1
Agent: Formalizing which is the smallest brand you guys are working with.
EndUser: Sir, we are working. Sorry, sorry you were saying something.
EndUser: What is the smallest brand, right?
EndUser: A company which is having 1 or 2 million of turnover early.
Agent: Do you have any such companies in your portfolio?
Agent: Sir, we are working with smaller companies as well. It's not only just the big, big locals. We are working with companies of all scales and all sizes.
Agent: In [GPE-2] also, we are working with, let's say, let's say, in [GPE-2], we are working with the companies.
Agent: We are working with [ORG-52] which is an agency which is a very small footprint of [ORG-1] which you may not even have heard of.
Agent: And then we also have a couple of, actually we're working with a couple of startups as well in [GPE-2].
EndUser: Let me open up.
EndUser: How much time suppose if we manage 4 of our out of 7, if we manage 4 of our restaurants with [ORG-1], right?
EndUser: How much time either on [ORG-38] or me or somebody from our Marketing team
Agent: Would be investing on day to day basis?
Agent: Sir, in terms of your timing on 4 restaurants, essentially
EndUser: Your Implementation will be done by the partner. You don't have to do this implementation.
EndUser: No, after the Implementation we are talking about the day to day basis, right?
EndUser: Once the Implementation is done, does everything is done and after that is not required for us to do anything or on day to day how much time a technical person are required or a
Agent: One marketer is required to maintain the systems. So it can literally be [TIME-7] as well, because everything is automated once that setup is done.
Agent: Unless and until you want to add more campaigns, more journeys, you want to change your creatives.
Agent: A marketer doesn't have to log in or create or launch these journeys, because once we've set it up, all you do is click on activate and it keeps on running on an automated basis.
Agent: So usually from my experience, I've seen usually most of the brands running around 5 to 7 journeys on a regular basis.
Agent: Unless an athlete, for example, you may have <inaudible> [DATE-15], but because <inaudible> [EVENT-1] is coming somewhere on [DATE-15] in [GPE-3].
Agent: So if you want to do, let's say, one of stand-alone campaign for it, which you may not have accounted for during the initial implementation, only that is something that you need to create. Otherwise, all your
EndUser: Awareness journeys. are onboarding journeys or post-visit journeys, usually these are accounted for so you don' t have to maintain them . Okay.
Agent: And how much time is required to set up the systems with is required to set up a system on the on the first time. It can vary anywhere from [DATE-17] to [DATE-15] depending on the use cases.
Agent: There will also be a time, this also accounts for the time where the partner, you know, partner team effectively interacts with you, with [PERSON-1] and your Marketing ecosystem, Marketing team in order to identify that these are the use cases that you want to solve.
Agent: These are the integrations you want to do. These are the journeys that you want to do.
EndUser: And also the training, this also includes the training. that once they're.. . implemented everything they will also train your team or that these journeys have been created. You got it.
Agent: Yeah please go ahead yeah. So [PERSON-37] this is our [PERSON-1] that's it from my site.
EndUser: Would just love to hear from you in terms of your feedback did you think this was relevant to you this was a valuable use of your time. Yes, yes, definitely just quite relevant to what we are looking for.
EndUser: I think, see, we are a non-IT company, right?
EndUser: We are into food business.
EndUser: So here everything under IT is counted or compared against ROI, right?
EndUser: What is the return over investment out of whatever we are doing?
EndUser: So definitely we have the capability to onboard [ORG-1] for our business needs in terms of budget and all. But the only thing is we need to analyze that what is the return of our investment.
EndUser: How it's going to be beneficial for our business. That is the decision point for us.
EndUser: So I would say I would suggest that if you can bring out the proposal in a way that it initially should not be very heavy right from the from the pricing point of view and gradually we can expand to a
Agent: Lot of level.
EndUser: Features we can use at the next
Agent: Sure, it will definitely be priced that way. But that's why we, for example, in the same way. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, [ORG-52].
Agent: So, that's why we identify that to begin with start with an engagement module later on.
Agent: I'm sure that we've seen a lot of customers wanting to run those propensities or even a malgomated [PRODUCT-7] models they're running on a [PRODUCT-9] or a [ORG-17] vertex [PRODUCT-7]. So you can do those within [GPE-1] as well.
Agent: Again, essentially these run towards a little bit more complex and sophisticated use cases. But if that is something that interests you, you want to do that within your ecosystem, that's what we're looking for.
EndUser: I'll do something . which is doable. So start with the engagement, which is one of the modules and then move on to others as well.
EndUser: [PERSON-38], if we just want to use say the the males and the WhatsApp communication in the beginning, I am not interested in any other functionalities of the of the system.
EndUser: We will have our own database of around 86,000 emailers and around 47 to 52,000 of the mobile numbers. If we have to just use these two functionalities,
Agent: Will it still require the same time to set up and will the cost will be still be the same or there will be a differences?
Agent: Sir, in terms of, you know, channel again, in terms, so the way we price, you know, I understand that you don't want to use S for example, if you don't want to use SMS or ad campaigns, that does have an impact on the cost but it will not be a very significant cost as well.
Agent: In terms of Implementation also because a lot of logic also goes in, you know, embedding or integrating your data from the different source systems and creating these journey. So essentially in them, there's a little bit effort.
EndUser: That will be reduced, it will not be a very significant effort, but effectively in term s of course . course there will be some reduction there.
EndUser: And what will be the results in achieving the numbers, right?
EndUser: Significantly, this will be a very significantly impacted in acquiring new customers or targeting
Agent: The existing customers or wouldn't it be?
Agent: Sir, it would be. That's why a lot of our customers are still working with us. [ORG-4] is still offline. Myindra and myindra is there.
Agent: It effectively, if you, if you, you know, for example, let's say you go for a shopping with your, with your family, right?
Agent: You're looking for a jeans and somebody is giving you an offer for a shirt again and again.
Agent: You'd not be interested unless and until it is what you are looking for that's served to you, that offer is served to you. Of course you'll not go ahead and make that purchase.
Agent: So exactly that also happens with your customer. If I'm looking for a, let's say I'm a, I'm a vegetarian. So a lot of times if somebody says, you're. non-vegetarian food
EndUser: Option. I will not go ahead and you know be interested towards it . Got it. Thank you.
Speaker 7: Yeah, I think it seems good.
Speaker 7: [PERSON-1], you have any more questions?
Speaker 7: I think I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. Yeah.
Agent: So, yeah, [PERSON-4] will just wait for your proposal now. Sure. So, on case in terms of next steps, what I'm going to do is I will just send up a follow-up email in terms of the volumetric.
Agent: Based on those volumetric, we'll go ahead and, you know, sort of, you know, the proposal as well. And also, what a call out since [DATE-15] is an [DATE-23] for salesforce.
Agent: So, we do have some, you know, discount offers running
EndUser: Only for [DATE-15] as of now. So, something you can leverage. Yes, that was discussed. So, but yeah, this was discussed in the last call that [ORG-1] follows the [GPE-4] here, [DATE-15].
EndUser: So, that's why the entry end is the their financial year end.
EndUser: So, that's why are able to close at a deal, we'll get these benefits.
Agent: Within [DATE-21], if you
EndUser: If we can close this ASAP, if the proposal will have the ROI mentioned against as well, against the cost.
EndUser: Say if you'll be charging a [DATE-15] offset [MONEY-1], so what exactly the results to us against [MONEY-2]?
EndUser: If that way the proposal will be created is much easier for us to decide faster because that's only the constraint right that if I'm spending in [MONEY-1] in marketing, well this will give me a result of [MONEY-3] worth of venue generation This is my the minimum benchmarking always.
Agent: Or not.
EndUser: Whatever a dollar is spent on marketing, if you give me a five times of revenue, I'm perfectly fine to go ahead with any marketing, any types
Agent: Of tools to increase the revenue. Sir, what we do have some industry benchmarks that, you know, in similar industry, what we've seen by implementing
EndUser: These solutions, so we can send those stats to you. Perfect.
EndUser: Do you have any such numbers in here means is upon in your hand right now that in [ORG-7] what exactly the numbers you guys are working with over the numbers you have created for any [ORG-7] businesses.
Agent: Which is not based in [GPE-2] not based in [GPE-2] outside the [GPE-2]. Outside [GPE-2] if I look at.
Agent: So and [ORG-54] coffee for example, they had [PERCENT-1] increase in newsletter signups in [DATE-23].
EndUser: This bitties
Agent: In terms of ROI, so I can check and get back to you. I think I don't have anything handy but I'll get back to you. And also in terms of the
EndUser: Small logos that we are working with.
EndUser: I suggest that when you will do your proposal, give me a number, not on signing the newsletters or customer engagements and all those type of theoretical things if there can be a revenue based that can be good enough.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: And our price point in terms of consumer spending, you have to assume is [MONEY-4] per consumer on a per visit is spending. to [MONEY-5]
Agent: Per consumer per time.
Agent: And how many consumers do you have
EndUser: On a [DATE-15] basis?
Agent: Currently it varies from restaurant to restaurant.
EndUser: It means it can be used. On an average, if we talk about an average, if we talk about an register, lunch is around 21 to 47 guests. Right in dinner is around the similar for the register.
EndUser: And which is only we are fulfilling is [PERCENT-2] of our capacity.
Agent: [PERCENT-3] of our
EndUser: So we still have an scope of adding doubling these numbers.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: And if we talk about the biggest outlet, which is the [FAC-1], but that is too new, we just started in [DATE-21], which is hitting capacity of 526 packs at any time.
EndUser: So launch, we are doing around 52. We have an scope of going another 141 to 172 packs in a launch. Currently within one is around 47 to 52 in a launch and around 21 plus in a dinner.
Agent: And [DATE-21], we are getting
EndUser: So dinner, we have a more scope. Okay. And this is all is a buffet, buffet
Agent: For a breakfast lunch and breakfast is definitely is part of the hotel tie up we are doing around 470 plus. Okay. Sure sir.
Agent: I've noted these stats and we'll send you some industry in terms of this is the monitoring pack which our customers have seen in this particular industry.
EndUser: Benchmarks where in terms of ROI
Speaker 8: Perfect.
Speaker 9: Sure, so that's may want to add on?
Agent: It for my site. Anything else that you I didn't know. Thank
Speaker 10: You. Thank you. Thank you.
Agent: Thank you. I'll show you any details as well.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"* The sales rep could have done a better job of directly addressing the customer's concern about return on investment (ROI) by providing specific industry benchmarks or examples of how other similar businesses have seen an increase in revenue after implementing the product.

video_19789_167_6qr3y000000g3AAAAY,"Agent: Spend some time, push and record. Spend some time [DATE-1] telling you a little bit about One, sales force at large and why we think we'd be a good partner for your organization.
Agent: And then going a little bit more specific into what we've heard from you so far in the direction that we think we're headed as far as the licensing is concerned.
Agent: And so this is more an opportunity for us to share with you and for you to ask questions, right?
Agent: Like dig in, Ask us, you know, what do you clarify [PERSON-1]?
Agent: What the heck are you talking about, right?
Agent: Let's make sure that we all leave [DATE-1]'s call, you know, kind of level set on the same page.
Agent: Does that make sense for [DATE-1]?
Agent: Yeah, that's great. Awesome. And I did hear from our team that we've gotten some survey results back. And so keep those coming in and we'll be able to in a future call kind of review those together. Great. Awesome.
Agent: Okay, I'm gonna go ahead. And start my slide show and share my screen.
Agent: And we'll dig into it here.
Agent: Can you see my screen now?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Okay, cool.
Agent: All right, so what are we talking about [DATE-1]?
Agent: We're going to talk about how we can work together in a partnership to help you all collaborate internally, build strong programs that lead to funding delivering those programs and measuring your impact.
Agent: So that you can report back to those funders, right?
Agent: It's kind of like that loop, right?
Agent: Of strong programs with strong deliverables, with strong reporting lead to strong ability to ask for additional funding lead to more strong programs, right?
Agent: And that's kind of what we're going to be talking through here [DATE-1].
Agent: Before we dig into that, this is [DATE-2] for [ORG-1]. This is our our [DATE-3] conference called [ORG-2]. Do not try to read this. I will send this as follow up.
Agent: Our [DATE-3] conference called [ORG-2], which essentially takes over the city of [GPE-1] and [PERSON-2] here and [PERSON-3] are both going to be attending over [DATE-4], is happening.
Agent: During [ORG-2] we make [QUANTITY-1] of announcements, right, about exciting new innovations on our solutions. This is our fore-looking statement. This essentially says, hold your horses.
Agent: What's else similar for a second?
Agent: Make purchasing decisions based upon solutions that are currently available, right?
Agent: This is our, hey, we don't wanna over promise and under deliver to you statement.
Agent: Make sense?
Agent: Everybody agree?
Agent: All right, we can blow through that then. All right, agenda. All right, let's talk about [ORG-1].
Agent: Who is [ORG-1]?
Agent: Why do we exist in the world?
Agent: Why do we think we're a good partner for your organization?
Agent: We're going to flow directly into a single source of truth, [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: A place where you can house and store all of your constituent information, whether that's funders, grantees, constituents that you're serving, programs that you're running, elected officials that you're in contact, partner, etc, right?
Agent: Single source of truth with permissions for each individual on who they need to see and what they need to see.
Agent: Then we're going to flow into that internal collaboration using [ORG-3], right?
Agent: A place where your global team can go a single place where they can communicate with each other to plan those strong programs, to update each other on strong programs, to collaborate, to even say like, hey, I'm going to be in [GPE-2] [DATE-5].
Agent: Are you going to be there?
Agent: Let's get all a sidebar coffee, right?
Agent: This is a collaboration tool. Then we're going to talk a little bit about engagement with marketing. So now we have a single source of truth. We have internal engagement.
Agent: How do we empower your team to use all that information?
Agent: To drive campaigns that reach the right person at the right time with the right message.
Agent: And then how do we, as we're running those campaigns, collect even deeper and more information about those individuals to then feed right our knowledge to better target them and better communicate with them in the future.
Agent: And then we're going to talk about next steps. This is a lot to cram into [TIME-1]. We have far too many slides. Some of us are going to say, we're going to skip through this really quickly.
Agent: But we want to give you as big of an overall picture of who [ORG-1] is and what we're currently thinking is a path to success for the organization. Does it sound like a good agenda. Awesome.
Agent: All right, before we go there quick thank you [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5] for the work that you're doing you are literally saving our planet.
Agent: Okay, how do we even thank you for that?
Agent: Like we owe you our lives and our future generations lives. So thank you so much for the work that you're doing. I've shared in the past, my background is in the nonprofit space.
Agent: I work for environmental organizations, including [ORG-4] here in [GPE-3] and [ORG-5], which is a global organization under different titles depending on regions.
Agent: And this work to me is so personal and so critical. And I am thrilled to be having you. these conversations with you. I'm thrilled to be able to play a small part in this work.
Agent: So than k you so much for what you're doing and thank you for coming to these conversations with an open min d and an open heart .
Agent: And really kind of looking at how we might be able to partner together to build a solid foundation for the organization. So thank you. All right, let's talk about core values. Okay, we mean these.
Agent: I can't stress this enough, right?
Agent: You probably have similar core values at your organization. Trust, customer success, innovation, the quality, and sustainability.
Agent: These are our five pillars that our company has put forth to all of us to live [DATE-6] and to own in all of our conversations with our customers.
Agent: And I'm going to talk a little bit more about that last one, sustainability on the next slide.
Agent: Here at [ORG-1], we take sustainability very seriously. Probably not as seriously as you do.
Agent: I know if I had heard that when I was on your end of the call, I would say, hey, we're living and breathing [DATE-7].
Agent: But I want you to understand that this is a core value for [ORG-1].
Agent: We within the last, gosh, these all correct me from wrong year or two, we released a new solution called Net Zero Cloud that's helping for profit companies track their emissions and drive towards Net Zero.
Agent: This is part of our initiative and part of our belief that business is an avenue for change, right?
Agent: Potentially the greatest avenue for change. And so we're working as a corporate leader in this space. We are ourselves, not zero. We run on [PERCENT-1] renewable energy.
Agent: And we have a program that falls in line with the work that you all do. A goal of planting 104 million trees by [DATE-8].
Agent: And really kind of just leading the path and helping support a mission, right, of, hey, industry, it's time to take responsibility, right, and have a role in saving our planet.
Agent: So I wanted to share this slide and I will share this after we hop off as well so that you can kind of dig into this.
Agent: But I wanted you to understand who on the phone you're talking to and what kind of our values are and what our corporate values are. This makes sense. We'd love some feedback from you on these things as well.
Agent: I'm sure we've got a collaborative team who is always looking to be better partners with the leaders in the space who are doing this important work. OK. All right.
Agent: So that's a little bit about [ORG-1] as a company, right?
Agent: Our values, who we are, what we're coming to this conversation at our core, right?
Agent: Believing. Let's talk a little bit about how our solution then helps organizations like yours become digitally mature.
Agent: That's the ultimate goal, right?
Agent: Because we hear that when organizations have digital maturity, they're 2.4994828074626 times more likely to reach their goals, and they're [PERCENT-2] of them say that their tech helped them be more efficient.
Agent: These are things that we want for you guys.
Agent: Our global, our planet needs this, right?
Agent: And so that's what we're here to talk a little bit about [DATE-1]. So oftentimes what we hear and what we've heard throughout our conversation so far is, hey, we have siloed systems.
Agent: We have some teams working in one [PRODUCT-1], another team working on in a spreadsheet here. We've got another team over here that's using a different tool to kind of help project manage their work.
Agent: And what our goal is to bring you onto a unified platform that allows you to gain insight into all of your work. at an alliance, literally in a glance, right, through advanced reporting and analytics.
Agent: We don't want these workarounds. We don't want folks saying, oh, we need to figure out how to do x, y, and [PERSON-6] So we're going to create 44 cell spreadsheet to track that.
Agent: We want to make sure that you have a foundation and a tool that will be able to house and store all of that. And that works with your team.
Agent: Is user friendly?
Agent: Is easy for them to get that information in?
Agent: And it's easy for you all to get the information out. We don't want a static solution. You all went through a merger and I believe it was [DATE-9].
Agent: [DATE-10], you guys grew tremendously. Your programs are going to continue to grow. The influence that you're having in this space is so tremendous that the work that you're doing needs to be scalable.
Agent: We need a solution that is flexible enough to adapt to the changes in the headwinds of, well, one, the actual environment and two, the environment around sustainability.
Agent: And is scalable and relies on innovation, right?
Agent: So [ORG-1], we innovate on our solutions constantly. And mentioned, [ORG-2] is happening [DATE-8] where new [ORG-6] is going to be introduced or rolled out or announced. And that's just part of what we do.
Agent: We make updates to our solutions three times a year based off of the feedback of nonprofit organizations. So we survey and we talk with our organizations throughout [DATE-14] to learn about, you know, what's still causing challenges.
Agent: Where are there opportunities for us to grow our solutions to better serve you with the work that you're doing?
Agent: I want to just pause here because I've just rambled here for maybe [TIME-2]. And I just want to get some feedback from you.
Agent: Thoughts so far on what we're talking about?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I think it sounds great. And I mean, this part is really good.
Agent: So keep it going.
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: Onward. All right. Tell me if you're like, hey, slow down for me.
Agent: All right, let's dive into specifically what are we talking about?
Agent: Okay, right?
Agent: We want to get you out of siloed systems. We want to get you out of single source of truth.
Agent: What does that mean?
Agent: Right?
Agent: What we're looking at right now, we call this our constituent or our funder or our customer, depending on who you're talking with our patient, right, in other areas of our business. 267.
Agent: In the middle is your person who you, Just think of an imaginary person who you all need to communicate with and have a strong relationship with.
Agent: This could be a board member, this could be a funder, this could be the leader of a partner organization, this could be a member of a government or an elected official.
Agent: And how do we solution, right, provide you with tools that help you maintain and grow that relationship?
Agent: Around the outside are four kind of pillars that most nonprofits, including what we've heard from you all so far, find super valuable about nonprofit class.
Agent: It's going to help you with your grants management, right?
Agent: And I want to kind of put in that bucket your project management, right?
Agent: So it's kind of, you know, helping you to be able to track the different stages of a grant, what deliverables are associated with that grant, what communication needs to happen back to the funder about that grant.
Agent: In a really clear and concise way. And because your teams are all putting data and information into [ORG-1], your single source of truth, that ability to then report back to the grantee becomes much more simplified.
Agent: [QUANTITY-2] overview of that piece of the puzzle. I also want to talk about Marketing engagement. [ORG-1] is the world number one [PRODUCT-1] and the world's number one, Marketing and engagement solution.
Agent: So we want to put good information in the [ORG-1]. We want to use that information to communicate out to our constituents. We want to use that communication to gather more information about them.
Agent: [DATE-16], excuse me, when do they open emails?
Agent: What types of emails are they open?
Agent: What are they clicking on?
Agent: When are they clicking on it?
Agent: What are they interested in?
Agent: And make sure that we are then targeting them with future communications that they're going to be responsive to, right, that bring value to them.
Agent: How do we bring value to your constituents so that their affinity is deepened with the organization?
Agent: And then how do we empower our teams internally to work collaboratively?
Agent: Hey, I noticed that this email landed. I noticed that we had a huge open rate on this. We need to really dive in and deepen engagement or our communications around this area.
Agent: Or hey, we've got a big grant coming up.
Agent: We need this renewal so badly, right?
Agent: Like the work depends on us getting this renewal.
Agent: Let's pull together and collaborate internally on [ORG-3] so that we're all pacing towards the same goal of a really strong renewal application so that we can make sure that we're continuing the funding.
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-1], can I do.
Agent: Jump in real quick?
Agent: Please
Agent: Wonderful. Hey, everybody. I am going to have to drop pretty soon to get down to [ORG-2]. Like [PERSON-1] said, I'm here in [GPE-1] [DATE-8].
Agent: You know, the nonprofit cloud is really the foundation of what we're putting forward for C4iCRAF. And what's so important about this is we're talking about these four pillars for fundraising.
Agent: We're going to talk about how you work with your funders, how you go after and seek those grants.
Agent: We're talking about how you're going to manage the actual administration of those grants, right?
Agent: Doing that required reporting, those deliverables that [PERSON-1] mentioned.
Agent: But the thing to keep in mind about [ORG-1] is we are a platform and we are designed to empower you to be able to build the things that you need around these pillars on this platform.
Agent: Because as much as we work hard with the industry, we work to deliver [PERCENT-3] of the things that you all need to do out of the box.
Agent: But we purposely maintain about a sort of difference there that allows you the agility that you need to do the things that you do because you're doing forestry research.
Agent: You're doing things that other organizations aren't doing and you're going to have procedures and things you do that don't match up with how other people do them.
Agent: And so with [ORG-1] and the nonprofit cloud we're delivering you an agile platform grounded in trust and the best practices of not just our non-profit sector, but the commercial sector, the healthcar e sector, all around the globe .
Agent: To enable you to make sure that you are going to be on a firm footing as you continue to grow and change and do new things.
Agent: And just as [PERSON-1] ended talking about the collaboration, you know, that stakeholder in the middle could very well be used.
Agent: See, it can be you that's there in the center of what C4iCraft is doing because with [ORG-3] and the ability to collaborate, we can take and put your grant reporting in [ORG-7] that then eventually flows into salesforce.
Agent: Where the reports are drawn from. So all of these pieces aren't independent silos. They're a unifie d platform . that helps us to grow and be successful.
Agent: According just for the sake of because I don't know if it's in this deck, I also want to say that we have a network of more than 3,000 applications that our partners have built on top of [ORG-1], that you can install into your [ORG-1] instance with the click of a mouse, that add much more bespoke functionality to enable you to do more while not having to create things from scratch.
Agent: And that app exchanges what we call it.
Agent: It's an integral part of how [ORG-1] works because we have partners that work in your space that understand your space, not as well as you do, but pretty close And they work with folks like [LOC-1] and all of the different [LOC-1] members .
Agent: To help learn and understand the practices around international grant making in particular and what it looks like and how it works. Just one example.
Agent: So that's I think a really important thing to understand and it helps explain sort of why we want to have a broader conversation, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5]. It's not just about the communications or the fundraising or the marketing.
Agent: It's about a broader sort of discussion around how we can help see for I. Thank you so much, [PERSON-1], for letting me jump in and do that little monologue. I'm going to go back on mute now.
Agent: All right. Awesome. Thank you, [PERSON-7].
Agent: I think you bring up some really good points, right?
Agent: And as we kind of move through [DATE-1], I want to kind of keep gut-checking with you, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], right?
Agent: So far, what we're looking at, how does this resonate with you?
Agent: What kind of questions does it bring up as we're looking at the screen right now?
EndUser: I mean, I guess when I look at this, I mean, the main thing I'm thinking about is kind of the core kind of areas of our program that we'd like to.
EndUser: That need this kind of support. And I think I think this fits it pretty well. We've discussed it already, but it's basically. the kind of fundraising grant management, project management teams. So that's two teams.
EndUser: And then both of those have a kind of a small core team and then they have a distributed teams in the regions. So that's those two teams. And I think they would really. benefit from this.
Agent: Can I ask a quick question [PERSON-4] just because this will help us as [ORG-8] e we're kind of both pulling towards hey we're gonna know if need to know how much this is going t o cost right so those two teams .
Agent: How many people are we talking about on those two teams?
EndUser: Well, they both probably, the resource mobilization team is probably like five core members. And I think the project management unit is also about the same size. And then they would have
EndUser: Distributed functions in the region, so they might each have an additional 16 people or so.
EndUser: So, you know, and I'm not sure if all of those 8 people would need to be active users, or if this could just be managed by that core team of, say, five for each.
EndUser: That part, I guess I would need to understand the solution a little bit better, and then we could.
EndUser: Could bring them in and have them explain or I could find out in detail how they would imagin e this being rolled out within their programs But that kind of takes fundraising program managemen t to some extent in grants management Between those two teams, that's kind of the main they would cover those three areas Then the Marketing and engagement is somethin g that would be better as a and should restore their curve be between my team, the communications, and Outreach tea m. probably bind with the resource mobilization or fundraising team.
EndUser: But the one that's not here, which maybe is program management, but it's that executive level
[ORG-9] Management of that executive level network and constituency. which maybe could fall into program management, but not sure.
Agent: And are you talking about executive level at your organization?
Agent: Are you talking about your relationships with other executives or leaders in the space?
EndUser: Yeah, exactly. So it's basically for use by the executives in our organization and then managing their networks.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Which would be at a similar level in our partner organizations.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: And that executive team is, you know, there's probably
EndUser: About or 23 people that we would want involved in that part.
Agent: Awesome.
Agent: That's really good for us to understand and certainly right when we're talking about the constituent, the gentleman in the middle of the circle, that can truly be anyone, right?
Agent: So those executive contacts or personal relationships that your leadership has, certainly tracking those relationships in your [PRODUCT-1] is a core use of the solution.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: Great.
Agent: And as you know, as I'm asking this question right about how many people we also talked during our last call about being able to provide you with, you know, some guide rails or some bumpers on how our licensing work.
Agent: And so anyone who would need access to that information, either to enter that information in, to view it, or to report out on it, would require a user license.
Agent: And so having information about headcounts and things of that nature helps us to start kind of plugging those numbers in, rather than using [PRODUCT-2], right?
Agent: It's kind of finessing that fine tuning that, and we'll continue to massage that throughout our conversations to make sure we're landing on an appropriate number of users. for the organization.
Agent: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah. I mean, so is this something though that I should go out and find out from our out to them pretty much right away.
Agent: Team?
Agent: I can definitely get
EndUser: And is there any distinction between like a kind of management type user?
EndUser: So if we have five people in the core team for fundraising. you know, and if they have maybe 13 people who would access that in addition to those five, we would just count that as 13 people.
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Yeah, we, the user licenses, depending on you know, their role at the organization, stay the same. the access or the information that they can view or change or etc can change.
EndUser: Okay. Okay. Okay. That's that's how cool. So I can, I can find that out.
Agent: Okay, fantastic. And as we get towards the end of the call [DATE-1], I'm going to propose some next steps where we talk maybe with some core members of each of those teams over [DATE-8].
Agent: So that we can do a deep dive into their specific day-to-day operations and needs, right, and have a better understanding from them. So we can, you know, you can certainly reach out to start getting those guide rail numbers.
Agent: And then we will also, you know, if you're comfortable with giving us access to folks to kind of better understand their day-to-day operations, we'll ask those questions as well during our calls.
EndUser: Okay, yep, that's fine.
Agent: Great.
Agent: I'm going to move forward because I've got a couple of people on this call that are like, are you going to let me talk here [DATE-1]?
Agent: And so I'm going to bounce quickly. So we talked a little bit about nonprofit cloud. I will send this deck as follow up so that you can drill into this.
Agent: But this little picture here is just a great visual of what some dashboards and what the internal nonprofit cloud might look like for you all. All right, ramp making.
Agent: We've talked about this really high level two slides back, but this is a solution that's going to allow you to create your unified view of all your funding programs.
Agent: From everything from planning through delivery through renewal and reapplying for those grants. It's going to quicker teams right to have visualization on the outcomes of those grants to make adjustments throughout. Right throughout the program.
Agent: Hey, this doesn't seem to be working. We need to, we need to tweak this right better stronger programs lead to more funding leads to better stronger programs.
Agent: And it's going to help you gain some efficiencies right bringing your teams together under one single source of truth to really dive in. So we're just talking previously about numbers around grant making teams, leadership teams, project management teams.
Agent: I'm curious if there are other folks at the organization who would need access for data entry.
Agent: These might be folks who are regionally based, folks who are doing actual, doing the actual resource and reporting back to the team about the status of projects.
Agent: Just curious if that opens up any kind of, you know, you can get good informatio n at this email .
Agent: Just oNY fiv e people in col d Anything else for you that we should kind of dig into for [TIME-3].
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I guess the question here would be for us, whether we would want a kind of small, centrally managed, kind of tightly controlled system, which would then mean a small team that's really dedicated to managing this resource.
EndUser: Or if we want to devolve that to the people who are actually responsible for it. implementing the projects. So that's a larger group of maybe 21 people or something lik e that .
EndUser: And whether that would be worthwhile to extend that to them. I'm sure they would benefit from it, but then there's the cost part of it as well, which we're not really sure about yet.
EndUser: But that would be, I guess, a second level to be considered.
Agent: Absolutely. Yeah. What we'll be able to do as we're getting some rough volumes, we know that you're going to need to tweak these numbers.
Agent: From you is we can start massaging those numbers, right?
Agent: And so as you're kind of thinking about weighing the two things, right?
Agent: One is, what do we need?
Agent: What can we afford?
Agent: We do this all day, every day in our personal lives as well.
Agent: Right?
Agent: And trying to find the balance between those two things.
Agent: And so as we kind of dive into, you know, costs and things of that nature, we can massage those, we can make adjustments and really kind of get that into a place that it's going to make sense for the organization.
Agent: All right. [PERSON-8], I've been talking now for too long. You're
Agent: Off. Okay. Thank you, [PERSON-1]. And just to take a quick step back on the [ORG-3] piece, [PERSON-4], I know that you've had some experience using [ORG-3].
Agent: And I just wanted to, yeah, take a step back and remind everyone kind of how we think about [ORG-3] and what it has become over [DATE-16] now.
Agent: So we know that there are other channel-based Messaging platforms out there in the space, but [ORG-3] is really the only platform that brings together automation, knowledge, and connection together in one place so that we can help drive productivity.
Agent: In a whole new way, really with the goal of helping organizations go faster towards their mission. So it starts with this open and extensible platform.
Agent: And again, you'll hear me using the word platform a lot because again [ORG-3] is so much more than just a direct Messaging tool. It truly is a platform.
Agent: So Similar to what [PERSON-9] was mentioning about [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-1], we keep this open and extensible so that you can customize [ORG-3] to meet the needs of C4. What your [ORG-3] looks like may be different from other nonprofit organizations.
Agent: We purposely keep it that way.
Agent: On top of that, we also have over 2,539 applications that can be integrated into [ORG-3] and are ready to go with the click of a button so that you can use all the apps that you already have [DATE-1] at [ORG-10] them together in one place That includes, I know we've talked about and heard that some of those applications that exist [DATE-1] are things like Zoom We can think of things like [PERSON-10], which I know has been mentioned on a few calls, time sheets, those can all be integrated into you r Slack instance.
Agent: And of course, [ORG-3] has deep connections with the [ORG-1] customer 47 so that everything that [PERSON-1] was mentioning previously, there are deep integrations in to that and not something that we can explore as well.
Agent: How do those platforms work togethe r?
Agent: So, how does [ORG-3] make work more productive?
Agent: We do it in three k ey you is. One is accelerating work with automation. So this automation can be things like no code workflows, pre-built integrations.
Agent: And really you can think of this as those day-to-day tasks, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-8], that we all have to do, that may not feel like they're driving towards the mission completely, but they have to get done.
Agent: There are opportunities where [ORG-3] can help automate some of these so that you can spend your time on the work you really need to be doing.
Agent: The second way we help organizations be more productive is by searching and sharing knowledge. And we heard through our conversations to date that.
Agent: This is going to be something that's very important for C4 when we're talking about research sharing, right?
Agent: Or we're talking about being able to search through a system that has all of this knowledge in it. You can think of [ORG-3] as almost a repository for knowledge.
Agent: So the more information that you put in there, actually the more valuable it becomes. Because that is all accessible and searchable by the staff. at the organization .
Agent: The third way that we help organizations become more productive is really by connecting and engaging everyone.
Agent: Again, we heard that this is something that's very important to see for when we think about how your workforce is globally distributed, working across different time zones, sometimes in different languages.
Agent: So this is where we think about that idea, [PERSON-4], that you mentioned in the past of creating that kind of common culture. and connecting everyone.
Agent: And there's a number of built-in features within [ORG-3], such as huddles and clips that help bring that workforce together. So [PERSON-1], if you don't mind just moving to the next slide.
Agent: And as you're doing that again, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], when we're thinking about [ORG-3], how I like to think about it in the context of the Salesforce 383 that [PERSON-1] was mentioning, think of [ORG-3] as that engagement layer.
Agent: So when [PERSON-1] was mentioning that grants management process, you can think of [ORG-3] and that example is the place where that collaboration operation around that process would be taking place .
Agent: The work that goes into that proces s would take place in [ORG-3] .
Agent: That make sense ?
Agent: So as far as what we've heard to date from you all, you know, we really value the opportunity to help see for transform your internal collaboration.
Agent: We know that's what you had come to us to talk about originally and really based on what we've heard to date, we're thinking about this in three buckets of how we can do this for you.
Agent: And would love any feedback on this, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], to make sure we're going down the right path.
Agent: So one of those, again, this goes back to that, creating that common culture, [PERSON-4], that I know you've mentioned by breaking down silos. So we really think about driving staff collaboration and productivity.
Agent: And that means getting work done from anywhere, uniting everyone in this common culture at C4 with the tools that you're already using [DATE-1] and bringing that fall.
Agent: Together again and what we can think of as like a digital office . We also have the opportunity to support the research that you mentioned was so critical to C4.
Agent: So we have many, many customers that are using [ORG-3] to move research forward by ensuring timely consistent secure communication.
Agent: Bringing everyone together who's working on that research in one place, cross-functionally, so that they're engaged in all of the stages of the research project.
Agent: They're able to share that across the organization and support that key piece of your organization. And then thirdly, accelerating organizational success and project management.
Agent: So again, by centralizing and automating information from multiple sources into [ORG-3], into one single source of truth and one platform, that can support faster collaboration, decision making.
Agent: We project management is one of the key use cases that we see [ORG-3] being used for across.
Agent: All different types of Industries So we feel very confident that that's somethin g that we can also help provide value around And therefore, of course, ultimately helping you you know, drive towards your missio n in a more productive way .
Agent: So I'll pause there for a second. Would love to hear any feedback. As you could probably see on the last slide, there's a lot that [ORG-3] can do.
Agent: So we want to make sure that we're aligning to your key priorities and we can certainly pivot if these aren't those.
EndUser: Yeah, no, this sounds great. And this is, like you said, this is the original reason why we started the conversation. And I think you pretty much had the main points.
EndUser: The one that I just wanted to make sure we don't forget is that there's need for collaborative spaces, which could be a collaborative space around a project or a research theme.
EndUser: Or say a new strategy developmen t like this saying we're doing in [LOC-2] but then there's also would be some nee d for kind of management communication to staff So it would be great to hear more about that how exactly that would work
EndUser: How that space can be controlled and manage d so that conversation don't just kind of, you know, get out of contro [NORP-1] So that would be, that's the part of it that we would definitely want t o, that would want to see that in the, you know, kind of articulated in the [GPE-4] l.
Agent: Great. Thank you for sharing that, [PERSON-4]. And that's great to hear. And absolutely something that [ORG-3] is wonderful at as well. So we will make sure in our next steps that is something that we show and is articulated.
Agent: It's something that we do every day here at [ORG-1]. So we have a lot of wonderful examples of how management communicates to staff, how staff communicates to one another, some best practices around that, some examples of that.
Agent: Certainly a key part of what [ORG-3] can help do And then as far as that need for collaborative spaces .
Agent: Around, you know, a strategic meeting that you all are having, like the one you're at [DATE-1] or things of that nature. absolutely [PERCENT-1] as well.
Agent: And actually we have a solution that I think will make a lot of sense when we show it to you as far as how we can almost have different workspaces that bucket, whether it's certain projects, certain departments, perhaps even certain, you know, management groups.
Agent: So we can go into that more for sure. And that kind of goes along the lines of.
Agent: I know you had mentioned previously that you've been working in a single workspace and it's like how do we organize something for all 667 staff members and keep that clean and keep that organized.
Agent: We have a solution for that. So I think that ties into what you're mentioning as well. So we'll certainly share that too. So thank you for that feedback. Anything else on that piece. Stay here. [PERSON-4].
Agent: No, that's good. That's great. OK, great. [PERSON-1], we can just slip to this, but I want to make sure that [PERSON-14] has some time here.
Agent: So really, again, just to wrap up, we can change the way that organizations work and function. And we are really excited about the opportunity to do that with you all and partner with you on that.
Agent: So thank you again for the opportunity.
Agent: I will hand it over to [PERSON-14], I believe, right?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: And I just want to kind of just weigh in really quickly here because I think that this is a really interesting transition in our in the presentation that we're doing right now, right?
Agent: We're talking about [ORG-3] internal collaboration tool, internal communication to help alleviate in part, right, [PERSON-4], to your point, help alleviate in part, crowded email inboxes. Right, how do we get all the communication that we need accomplished without.
Agent: Having an all staff email that goes out to hundreds of people that they don't need to see. And I think that this is a really interesting segue because [ORG-3] can help with that internal communication.
Agent: And what we're gonna talk about next and what [PERSON-14]'s gonna dive into is Marketing cloud, right?
Agent: Those external communications that you're gonna be sending out into the world.
Agent: Well, how do we ensure that those communications are meaningful and not, crowding out people in boxes, right?
Agent: And [PERSON-14]'s gonna dive into that a little bit about using all of that rich information that you have on your constituents to send targeted messages that are valuable to them, right?
Agent: So that they drive their engagement of the organization and not just clutter in boxes. [PERSON-14], do you
Agent: Wanna take it from there?
Agent: Yeah, sounds good, thank you. Yeah, so I know we have some things to do to close up the call too. So we'll keep it relatively high level.
Agent: But of course on the left-hand side here of this slide is what we typically see, right?
Agent: A very, very common challenges that organizations that we work with run into in terms of communications and making sure they're relevant and effective.
Agent: And really, and saving your team time too, right?
Agent: Especially with distributed teams as many locations as you have. I think it was up to 26 locations.
Agent: All of the various stakeholders you communicate with, right?
Agent: Government officials, funders, administrators, partners, universities, field assistants, right?
Agent: Who may be less responsive to email?
Agent: And then those senior level communications with important relationships with funders and officials that influence policy. So we wanna make sure that we're being effective and efficient.
Agent: Right in our communications approach and in the governance and how we Structure the technology here given distributed teams as well And that's what Marketing Cloud does right as a native salesforce solution It's about being able to use all of that information natively in your salesforce [PRODUCT-1], but also from any source so you can automate personalized journeys as we call them or campaigns that are relevant and timely that inspire your supporters to take action, right?
Agent: And all sort of a seamless process make increasing your efficiency, increasing your effectiveness through better email deliverability than it improves conversion rates, drives people to register for those events.
Agent: Then during the events are we sending appropriate communications and post-event, right?
Agent: Are we intelligently segmenting our database and particularly with each location so that those stakeholders regionally only receive those messages that are relevant to them?
Agent: And then of course, increasing your impact through.
Agent: The ability to optimize moving forward based on the performance of each of those campaigns, right?
Agent: So you're able to measure those metrics to know what's working and what's not working. And if you just advance to the next slide, this is really illustrating how the Marketing cloud, [ORG-1]'s communication and engagement solution.
Agent: Helps you know and expand your community through personalized experiences.
Agent: But given the time, I just want to touch on and highlight some of those important pieces for your organization, right?
Agent: Allowing each location to manage their own set of contacts locally.
Agent: While also providing that governance for one or two centralized locations is sort of more moved toward more of a centralized model, those two headquarters acting as one, providing all of the branding and templates for the organization.
Agent: So that the branding, you kind of protect that, right?
Agent: It's coming from one location, but also, providing each different location and team the flexibility to personalize for each of those locations.
Agent: While ensuring that you're compliant with [ORG-8], which is a major concern, right, that [PRODUCT-3] has certain features and functionality, and it's built in to support.
Agent: Right to be forgotten data portability, consent, restriction of processing, right?
Agent: Security, accountability and transparency, all of those things around GDPR. So that's top of mind for us for your organization as well.
Agent: And at the same time, as I just wrapped this up, supporting various languages for each location and all of the different domains that you have as assets for your organization.
Agent: And there are various ways to go about that, including what we call international sense, which allows you to select the specific language encoding for your email and provides pre-translated supporting pages, right?
Agent: So we can kind of hone in on what's going to be the best approach for you all. But that's what we've heard. Those are some of the additional questions we have around those. And then...
Agent: I'm just going to pause here looking at the time and because I've been chatting away.
Agent: Any questions about what we've covered so far?
Agent: Does that resonate based on everything we've heard from you [DATE-1]?
Agent: Do we miss the mark on anything so far?
Agent: Any questions or initial reactions?
EndUser: No, this sounds good. I think what we're... We're this, I guess overlaps kind of two areas of the organization. So, you know, Part of this is
EndUser: Well, if we look at marketing, I think we kind of need to look at two things. So there's the part of the organization, which is about fundraising.
Agent: Because,
EndUser: You know, I think we've covered that in quite some detail. And, you know, I think that some of the aspects of this in terms of, you know, if we're looking at segmentation and, you know, conversion and.
EndUser: You know, KPIs, all of that relates really quite, you know, to quite well to the resource mobilization team. From the communications team, there's, you know, we do a lot of these things as well.
EndUser: And, you know, we do have a pretty strong Marketing program. The goals are a little bit different. So those are not really. inversion goals in terms of marketing, or in terms of fundraising.
EndUser: But the goals there are more about
EndUser: Kind of thought leadership, you know, driving, you know, driving the conversation around global change and, you know, and what we're, you know, what are the kind of recommendations of what we're doing.
EndUser: So you know, those kinds of things are, you know, we look more at, you know, are people using our research?
EndUser: Are we being cited?
EndUser: You know, are we being cited?
EndUser: Are we appearing in traditional media, in our engagement on social media, and then al l the kind of things, the open rate of the newsletter, click-through rate, all of that kind of stuff all of which is pretty reasonably well advanced .
EndUser: But it's interesting to see how this could also, you know, these tools could be utilized in that way, possibly.
Agent: Yes, absolutely.
Agent: Having all of that connected, even though they're for different, you're measuring different things, right?
Agent: But still connected to communications overall for your organization. Now, I believe that [ORG-14], which is an important piece of it too, is using [ORG-16].
Agent: Are there different solutions that are being used for or by the resource mobilization and then your team Marketing communications?
EndUser: Yeah, so right now, we're really not that connected. So, yeah, for [ORG-14], we So we managed that the [ORG-14] accounts, so we're using [ORG-16] for that, and we use that for our C4Recraft accounts as well.
EndUser: So yeah, but there's not a big connect. It's a very different model. Resource mobilization is really relationships with governments and so forth.
Agent: And donor agencies
EndUser: Whereas for Outreach and engagement, we're looking at partners and practitioners that are in our field, big education and so forth.
Agent: Constituency
Agent: Gotcha.
Agent: And then real quick out of curiosity, thinking about tools and kind of what they used, it's kind of what you were describing kind of sounded like social listening or listening across kind of the social ecosphere, not just social media, including social media, but also on the web for, you know, maybe what these stakeholders may be using as far as your resources and publications and things.
Agent: Is that something you're doing now?
Agent: And if so, what are you using to listen?
EndUser: Yeah, well, we don't have like a great social listening solution.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: For social media, we use [PERSON-16] social. And so that, which is pretty sophisticated, but at the top end of their solution, it's a bit out of our range in terms So we can't quite go to of cost.
Agent: That talk. Sure. And, you know, we, [PRODUCT-4] integrates really nicely with [ORG-8], whether you're leveraging the listening component or not, just thinking about, you know, posting the resources and whatever you're using there.
Agent: So we partner with them really closely. All right. You know, the next slide really [PERSON-4] just kind of highlights some of those metrics.
Agent: We like to keep a really finger on the pulse of how our customers are doing, right?
Agent: Specifically, our nonprofit customers.
Agent: So those that do switch to a native marketing, a [ORG-1] Marketing solution, see an increase in all the right areas and a decrease in all the right areas, right?
Agent: In terms of return on investment and retention and acquisition of supporters and all those good things. So we certainly wanted to include that in the deck. But... This has been extremely valuable.
Agent: Thank you again and at this time I'm going to pass it back to recording.
Agent: Awesome and we are right at our time. I'm hoping that folks we every single time we have to run a little bit over. I'm hoping folks have a little bit of flexibility here as we close out our call.
Agent: I wanted to talk a little bit [PERSON-4] about you know kind of circling back to high-level process, right?
Agent: So what we show [DATE-1], we call this a digital transformation, right?
Agent: These are not small projects. They are not inexpensive projects. This could range anywhere from, you know, to do everything we talked about upwards to a [MONEY-1], right, depending on the volumes and counts.
Agent: And so I want to just benchmark with you. I know we were just talking about [PERSON-8] Social and it's a good saguai, right, as far as feasibility, right, and budget for the organization. Do those numbers.
Agent: Right and you are should we dial back should we continue to move forward with what we're kind of discussing here what are your initial reaction and thoughts to that?
Agent: Hope you're on mute.
EndUser: This is
Agent: That's [DATE-3] yeah it would be [DATE-3] for licensing yes yeah
EndUser: What would be like the split between the solutions?
Agent: Because we are not. quite there yet.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Right. We're doing mental math on our end and we have been for [DATE-13] as we've had these conversations.
Agent: And that's a big range, right?
Agent: That I just gave you 260 to a million is a significant range.
Agent: And so kind of what I have on the screen right now as far as next up is doing deep dives into each one of these core solutions that we just kind of outlined. And.
Agent: To be fully transparent, we are the closest to being able to provide you with pricing on [ORG-3] and marketing.
Agent: Okay, so I'd like to lead with those two deep dives and then we're going to be able to give you, you know, those buckets, right, and the pricing associated with those buckets.
Agent: And through those conversations, we're going to learn more about your [PRODUCT-1] needs. And really it comes down to those volumes, right, and those counts. So we [DATE-1] are tally, right, my mental tally.
Agent: I think it was around 108, we heard.
Agent: We still have a question mark of is that the final number?
Agent: Are there going to be other folks at the organization?
Agent: And we're thinking there probably are through our discovery that would need licenses. And so that's really where we're kind of going to need to do a little bit more discovery and understand use cases.
Agent: But I wanted to give out a range just because I think we're a little bit of chicken and egg here, right?
Agent: If we're not talking about something that's feasible for the organization, then we need to kind of pivot and change and focus and hone in on, you know, what is feasible?
Agent: Where can we have the biggest impact in ROI?
Agent: And so that's kind of my thought process here [DATE-1].
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I guess from, you know, I guess the, It depends a bit on how, I guess, how it's split up amongst those, you know, kind of four buckets, whether we would, you know, there would be decisions about the return on investment for each of the buckets, I think for [ORG-3], it's, you know, it's pretty, it seems a bit more straightforward to me.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So,
EndUser: You know, we have 693 staff. you know, we would want everyone to have access to that.
EndUser: You know, we would, I think, you know, the kind of functionality that you outlined is, you know, what we would want for all of those people. So that one seems to be pretty straightforward.
EndUser: Crm to me is something that we could probably scale to meet the budget, right?
EndUser: So we could have a, a small, tightly managed CRM system. And if that's enough to get started with, to implement and people start to use it and they see how it works.
EndUser: And then we say, okay, now let's roll it out [DATE-13] and include more people when we feel like we've got, you know, some good results and we have people on the team who are, you know, can kind of lead that with their broader global teams.
EndUser: You know, that might be a nice way to handle the [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: And, you know, it would also allow I think it would give the internal team confidence that, okay, this is working for us and we definitely want to roll it out further.
EndUser: We're seeing a definite return on investment, so it's going to pay itself off and that's great.
EndUser: Then the Marketing part, I'm a little bit less sure about partially because it's For the communications side of things, it's working reasonably well. I have no doubt that these tools would improve.
EndUser: But that and because it's kind of split between resource mobilization and communications in our organization the way we are now. That one I would have to think about more
EndUser: Or maybe hear more about or talk internally about how we might collaborate across our two functional areas to make them optimize that.
EndUser: But I guess the thing with the communications is it's, I think it's seen as working reasonably well.
EndUser: So it'd be a bigger ask to say, you know, we're taking something that's working well and, you know, spending more on it.
EndUser: So that would be a bigger ask where I think from the resource mobilization side, I think people would feel like, oh, wow, but we do need a solution here. We don't have the solution.
EndUser: Now we need something better . So that's a easier ask.
Agent: That makes perfect sense, right?
Agent: And I think that as we're thinking through this, having that phased mindset is going to lead to success here, right?
Agent: Into a good partnership. I do want us to spend some time digging into each of these buckets with the appropriate teams so we can at least give you sideposts right.
Agent: The reality is that ROI goes through the roof skyrockets with an interconnected full solution set, right?
Agent: And so as we're talking about this, we will in our future conversations start weaving in some of those ROI metrics.
Agent: I'm hearing right now that your Marketing solution is working for you and that you guys are happy with how it's performing.
Agent: It's on us to kind of explain why change, right?
Agent: Like what would be the value add to the organization. And the good news is we have because of the nature of our business, we have lots of data on metrics to help guide that as well.
Agent: And so I'm actually going to propose just giving internally are calendars and this is going to seem a little backwards given what you just said [PERSON-4], that we actually start with maybe a deeper dive into your Marketing and book out [TIME-1] here in [DATE-21] to better understand things like the volumes of messages that you're sending.
Agent: [PERSON-14] is like [PERSON-1], there's so many questions I have. And I think that I think that you and [PERSON-5] are the right people to have for that portion.
Agent: But I'd love to also invite anybody that's on the fundraising side of your Marketing and communication and Outreach to join that call.
Agent: Is that something that you'd be open to?
EndUser: Yeah, so I mean, we do I would like to bring in, you know, representatives from the fundraising team as well as our Outreach person. And she would be good to have on that call as well.
Agent: Okay, fantastic. Is now a good time for us to compare calendars. That's exactly who we want there to.
EndUser: We would have to reach out to them. the Outreach person just left for [GPE-5], so that's good, go in your direction.
EndUser: And she'll be in [GPE-5] and then [GPE-6] for [DATE-17], week and a half. So that's okay. Then from the fundraising side, we have someone based in [GPE-7].
EndUser: I'd like to have him involved and then someone else in [GPE-8]. So it's going to maybe get a little tricky to get everyone involved in that.
EndUser: Can you give us some options?
Agent: Yeah, [PERSON-14], do you have some options
Agent: You can pull out?
Agent: Yeah, just pulling up time zones for those other places you mentioned as well, [PERSON-4], because I want to be cognizant of that. So yeah, [GPE-7], of course, is going to be much later, so the earlier, the better.
Agent: So if we could do like a or [TIME-4], also for that person who's going to be in [GPE-5] and [GPE-6]. And then [PERSON-16], let me know if this works with your calendar.
Agent: We could potentially do [DATE-23] at 9 or 9
Agent: And 838 [ORG-16] is the time
Agent: That this meeting started. Just kind of. Yeah, that would be that would be 261 in [GPE-2].
EndUser: Ok, yeah, [DATE-23] is not going to work for me.
Agent: It looks like we could also do [DATE-21] or [DATE-26]. At those times, I mean, really, any time [DATE-5] at those times, if that works for sharing.
Agent: I can't do [DATE-21] at [DATE-17]. have Oh, thank you.
Agent: I something on my calendar.
Agent: My calendar is pretty up to date, but I couldn't do [DATE-21], but I could potentially do any other day.
Agent: Um, or potentially [TIME-5], which would be three. [GPE-2].
Agent: Yeah, I could do [DATE-26]. I could do at that time. I could do [DATE-26]. Um, really any other day that week. At that time would work except for [DATE-21].
EndUser: Yeah, so I could do [DATE-26], but a little bit later, [DATE-26] at four [GPE-2]. No, sorry. Yeah, four in [GPE-2].
Agent: So that would be, I guess, 10 for you. Yeah, that'd be 10 of [ORG-16]. That works for me. It looks like it works for you, [PERSON-13], for [TIME-1].
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: That works. Okay. And then I could do [DATE-26] at [DATE-17].
EndUser: Um, and. It looks like [DATE-17] at 10
Agent: Again.
Agent: It looks like
Agent: We could do it. I want to make sure that [PERSON-13] well.
Agent: Is on these calls as
Agent: [PERSON-13] needs to be our constant. So it looks like we could do [DATE-17] at 854.
EndUser: Can you design work for for you.
Agent: You?
Agent: Share this out
EndUser: Yes. Be 10.
Agent: Yeah, I think that Yeah, that works for me too.
EndUser: Works actually better for
Agent: Everybody.
Agent: [PERSON-13], I see that I can
Speaker 9: You've got.
Agent: Make that work. Yes, I can do [DATE-17]. I was going to be me to the punch. I can't do [DATE-26] [TIME-6] at all. I have two
Agent: Other customer calls.
Agent: So
EndUser: [DATE-26]. [DATE-17], we're going to [DATE-17].
EndUser: Can we just because I am not sure people?
Agent: About the other Just to give them some options.
EndUser: Oh, yes.
Agent: I mean
EndUser: Is [DATE-26] at [DATE-17].
EndUser: Is it possible?
Agent: Let me put this whole. Let's this on our calendar.
Agent: Hold
Agent: I'll look at it. The calendar is here.
Agent: One star and I and I believe [PERSON-16]. I'm not sure about I can do [DATE-26].
Agent: [PERSON-13].
Agent: Okay, great.
Speaker 9: Okay.
Agent: And
Speaker 9: [PERSON-8].
Speaker 9: Are these?
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And then [PERSON-4], the other thing for [DATE-26] already, I can see if I can move it. So I can tentatively join for [DATE-26].
EndUser: Okay, and then so [PERSON-5], maybe you could check with [PERSON-21] and [PERSON-17], either available on those two times.
EndUser: And be good.
Agent: And then the other thing that I wanted to. Um, sorry, so kind of propose here, [PERSON-4]. And I'm putting these on our calendar so that we don't lose track of them done. yeah. No, done.
Agent: Is, you know, we talked about this when we did our map review. The other kind of component here is we're, this team is focused and zoomed down on the licensing that you need through [ORG-1].
Agent: The other piece, the puzzle is bringing that licensing to life as [PERSON-9] outlined, right?
Agent: Of it out of the box you're going to be able to run with.
Agent: It's really that [PERCENT-4] component of fine tuning, the nothing building, Specifically for your organization, using your language, your processes, your needs, is going to be done through an Implementation team, a third party team.
Agent: I want to make sure that we're clear on this because this is an additional line item in budget, right?
Agent: In [DATE-26], or if we do a phased approach, you know, it might be, you know, like, I want to just make that really clear. Not [DATE-21] forever, but [DATE-21] as you're going through your bases.
Agent: I'd like to bring in an implementation, make a recommendation on somebody, and hopefully be able to coordinate our calendars to bring them in on our next call.
Agent: Is that something that you're comfortable with at this point?
Agent: Because the goal would be, hey, we're able to provide you numbers on licensing, as well as then numbers for implementation. So you have total cost of ownership going into your budgeting season.
EndUser: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah, no, I think that's good.
Agent: Yeah, bring them in. Bring them in. Okay. And when we're thinking about partners, we're kind of benchmarking this on a couple of different things.
Agent: Partners that have done similar work in the past, partners that align with your vision and values as an organization, partners that meet a reasonable budget threshold, and reasonable is very much, actually, what's the right word, right?
Agent: It's very flexible, right, depending on how we look at it.
Agent: But then the other core component is... where are they located, right?
Agent: As we're looking at calendars right now and trying to figure out, you know, how do best work with you through this evaluation, most of us being on in [LOC-3] of [GPE-3], is there value in us looking at maybe either a partner that's located in close to [GPE-8] or in [LOC-2], just as, you know, a way of balancing, right?
Agent: Or is that less important to you all?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean for us the kind of [GPE-9] is the kind of sweet zone from a time point of view. So, you know, from, if Yeah.
Agent: You look at that.
EndUser: Kind of swath. Then that's ideal because we can usually coordinate from [LOC-4] to the [LOC-5] something, even if it's not always that easy to get all three regions on a call. But someone who's based in that time zone
Agent: Can go either way. I was thinking that might be the case. Yeah.
Agent: So let us noodle on and it actually is a little bit of our, frankly, our delay, right?
Agent: Because we're reaching out to. yo u some colleagues to get recommendations on partners in those time zones.
Agent: We want to make sure having a good partner is such a critical piece, right?
Agent: These are folks that you're going to be on the phone with. really consistently for a significant portion of time, it helps bring your life to your solution to life, as I mentioned.
Agent: And it also is going to be very critical when we're talking about delivering training and adoption, right?
Agent: We don't want to see you invest [QUANTITY-1] of money into a solution that nobody uses, right?
Agent: Like, let's prevent that from happening by making sure you're working with a really good partner who can help. inspire your teams, right, through usability, ease of use, and then also training and adoption techniques.
Agent: And so we're going to want to make sure that we have a really strong partner engaged in the rest of our process. They're also going to be listening for different things than we're listening for and asking different questions.
Agent: We're very much focused on making sure you're getting the tools, right?
Agent: And then they're very much focused on bringing those tools to life and in pulling, you know, existing data from different solutions.
Agent: We know you guys are an earpiece, right?
Agent: Like they're going to architect the licensing. So we'll bring them in ASAP. I want to, again, I'm taught I'm I've been on a listening tour, frankly, internally with my colleagues, both in [GPE-3] and then throughout [LOC-2].
Agent: On who might be a good partner to bring in that kind of would help support this work. I'm zooming in on that.
Agent: I want to do frankly an interviewer too with the partners to make sure that we're bringing somebody to the table that's really going to work.
Agent: Just kind of giving you a little preview of what's happening behind the scenes here. Just when you're not hearing from us, we're thinking about you guys. All right, cool.
Agent: And then, Do we want to quickly look at calendars [DATE-26]?
Agent: [PERSON-8], or when [PERSON-23] is back online to try to do that deep dive for [ORG-3]?
Agent: Yes, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], if you have [TIME-7], we'd love to just book that deep dive for [ORG-3].
Agent: And really the intention there is I think we want to show you a little bit more of what the product actually looks like and how it can map to some of those solutions that we talked about.
Agent: So if you're open to that, and I don't know again similarly to the Marketing piece, if there's other folks you want to bring in, or [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], if it's you guys, that's wonderful as well.
Agent: So, you know, you let us know, but really the goal of that call would be, we've heard a lot of the use cases for [ORG-3].
Agent: Let's show you a little bit more about what the product can do and what it can look like, and make sure that we're aligned to those.
Agent: And then coming out of that, I think we can have a very good idea of what licensing and cost can look like frankly. [DATE-38] or that following week that first week in [DATE-36].
Agent: That would probably be a good time for us. Right now, [DATE-38], I can see that that morning works pretty well for our team.
Agent: I don't know if that's open for you all or if it's best to look to [DATE-21], we could do something [DATE-26] [DATE-26], [EVENT-1].
EndUser: 4th. I think that's okay. Okay.
Agent: Does this time work?
Agent: Does a little later in the day work, like even [TIME-8] start?
EndUser: So started for in [GPE-2].
Agent: [PERSON-21]?
Agent: Yeah, for one or two.
EndUser: So, okay, I think for that one, it would be good to have some people from HR and maybe a couple of the people that I would bring in for that. But that's okay.
EndUser: We can do for, yeah, [TIME-9], it's okay. CET, it's okay. On [DATE-26].
Agent: So that would be [TIME-10].
Agent: Eastern I think and [TIME-8] in [GPE-2].
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Does that work?
EndUser: Is that right?
Agent: Three or four?
Agent: Yeah, it's okay?
EndUser: Four. I'm just [ORG-13]. Okay. Is that That's [TIME-14].
Agent: Okay. Great. It's [DATE-30].
EndUser: I don't
Agent: Know if that works with.
Agent: Your schedules,
Agent: But. That looks good for [PERSON-13] and I.
Agent: Okay. [PERSON-4], do we want you want us to give another option for [DATE-21] in case some of those other folks can't make it [DATE-26] on your end or.
Agent: We can.
EndUser: We can see. I guess.
EndUser: We can do [DATE-21] at the fourth.
Agent: Same time. The Yeah. OK. That can be our backup. But we can plan on that [DATE-38].
Agent: And then [PERSON-4], it's [PERSON-5], if you hear from other folks that on your end that the fourth is better, I'm sorry, but yeah, the fourth.
EndUser: We can make that work.
Agent: All right.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: We did it.
Agent: Scheduling is
EndUser: Always the hardest part.
Agent: We're [TIME-16] over our allotted time. I kind of feel like we probably should be scheduling these meetings for longer, but we will never learn.
EndUser: And
Agent: But I'm super excited that we had this opportunity to have this chat. I Recorded this. I also have this deck. I'm going to send this follow-up to you all so that you can check it out.
Agent: Thank you so much, [PERSON-26]. And then any kind of questions leading into [DATE-5], please let us know. I can't stress enough that as we're having this next series of calls, the more the merrier.
Agent: We want voices from every level of the organization to be engaged. Right, somebody who is... You know, entering in data, you know, we received a wire transfer check in, and, you know, needs to put that in.
Agent: It's as valuable in these conversations as somebody who is looking at overall reporting and doing forecasting on, you know, when the anticipated funds are coming in, right?
Agent: We want to make sure that we have the full picture here because this is a solution that's going to support the full team, right?
Agent: The full, the full organization. And so, Please don't be shy about inviting people and bringing their voice to the calls. Also, please don't be shy about sending out that survey.
Agent: That's still going to be super valuable for us to have that information.
EndUser: Yeah, we'll keep pushing that one. And we'll also work with our teams to give them a little bit better briefing on where we are and what we need going forward.
EndUser: Awesome.
Agent: Thank you guys so much. We'll send you out onward.
EndUser: Thank you so much. And I session.
Agent: Have a great, great strategy
Agent: Thank Thank you.
EndUser: You, [PERSON-4]. Thank you, [PERSON-5].
Agent: Bye bye.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job articulating the value proposition of the seller's product and company. They explained how the product can help the customer collaborate internally, build strong programs, deliver those programs, measure impact, and report back to funders. They also emphasized the seller's commitment to sustainability and how their solutions can help the customer become digitally mature. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have done a better job:

1. During the introduction of the seller's company, the sales rep mentioned that they have a conference called [ORG-2] and that they will be making [QUANTITY-1] announcements about exciting new innovations on their solutions. While this is informative, it does not directly relate to the value proposition of the seller's product or company.
2. The sales rep mentioned that the seller's [PRODUCT-1] is a single source of truth for storing all of the customer's constituent information. While this is an important feature, the sales rep could have emphasized how this feature can help the customer achieve their goals, such as improving collaboration, reducing errors, or saving time.
3. The sales rep mentioned that the seller's [ORG-3] is a collaboration tool, but they could have provided more specific examples of how this tool can help the customer. For instance, they could have mentioned that [ORG-3] can help the customer's global team communicate with each other, plan programs, update each other on program status, and collaborate on projects.
4. The sales rep mentioned that the seller's solutions can help the customer become digitally mature, but they could have provided more details on what this means and how it can benefit the customer. For example, they could have mentioned that digital maturity can lead to increased efficiency, better decision-making, and improved outcomes.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job articulating the value proposition of the seller's company and product, but there were a few missed opportunities to provide more specific and concrete examples of how the seller's solutions can help the customer.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""How many people are we talking about on those two teams?"" The sales rep asked this question to better understand the customer's needs and to help determine the appropriate number of user licenses. The customer seemed more engaged because they provided specific numbers and details about the team structure.
2. ""Is there any distinction between like a kind of management type user?"" This question was asked to clarify the customer's requirements for user roles and access levels. The customer's response showed increased engagement as they inquired about the specifics of user management.
3. ""What would be like the split between the solutions?"" The sales rep asked this question to understand the customer's budget and priorities for each solution. The customer's response demonstrated engagement as they discussed the potential allocation of resources for each solution.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were related to the cost and the feasibility of implementing the solution for their organization. The customer asked for a more detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each of the four buckets (CRM, [ORG-3], Marketing, and Implementation) and expressed that the range provided by the seller (260 to a million dollars) was quite significant. The customer also mentioned that they would need to consider the return on investment for each of the buckets.

Additionally, the customer expressed some uncertainty about the Marketing solution, as their current solution was working reasonably well. They mentioned that they would need to think more about or discuss further how they might collaborate across their two functional areas (resource mobilization and communications) to optimize the use of the Marketing tools.

Lastly, the customer had some questions about the implementation process and the role of a third-party implementation team, which would be an additional line item in their budget. They wanted to ensure that the implementation partner was located in a time zone that was convenient for their organization and that they had a good working relationship with the partner.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the correct decision maker was on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The seller proposed some dates for future calls, but it is not clear if these were confirmed or accepted by the customer.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They were open to scheduling follow-up meetings and involving more people from their organization in the discussions. They also expressed interest in understanding the ROI of the proposed solutions. However, they did mention the need to consider budget constraints and the importance of working with a partner located in a suitable time zone. Overall, they seemed engaged and interested in moving forward with the process.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Yes, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They mentioned that the product fits well with their core areas of program that need support and would benefit their fundraising, grant management, and project management teams. However, they also expressed a need to understand the solution better and involve their team members in the process.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of the seller's product to help them collaborate internally, build strong programs, deliver those programs, measure their impact, and report back to funders. They specifically mentioned the value of having a single source of truth for all constituent information and the ability to use the collaboration tool for communication and planning within their global team. The customer also appreciated the seller's background in the nonprofit space and their shared passion for environmental causes.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current communication and engagement strategy, particularly for the communications team. They mentioned that their goals are different from the resource mobilization team, focusing on thought leadership and driving the conversation around global change. The rep could have asked more questions to uncover specific pain points, challenges, and goals in this area.
2. The rep could have delved deeper into the customer's existing social listening solution and how it is used to monitor and analyze conversations around their research and publications. This would help identify opportunities for improvement and demonstrate the value of the proposed tools in addressing the customer's needs.
3. The rep could have asked about the customer's experience with [ORG-16] and how it is currently used for managing [ORG-14] accounts. This information would help the rep tailor their approach and recommendations for implementing and scaling the CRM system within the organization.
4. The rep could have inquired about the customer's budgeting process and timeline to better understand their constraints and priorities. This would enable the rep to provide more accurate pricing information and tailor their proposal to fit the customer's financial requirements.
5. The rep could have asked about the customer's experience with digital transformation projects in the past, including any successes or challenges they encountered. This information would help the rep understand the customer's readiness for change and tailor their approach to address any concerns or reservations.

By spending more time understanding the customer's needs, the sales rep can build a stronger relationship, provide more targeted recommendations, and increase the likelihood of a successful partnership.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep asked several open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions include:
- ""What do you clarify [PERSON-1]?"" (to encourage the customer to ask questions and express their concerns)
- ""Thoughts so far on what we're talking about?"" (to gauge the customer's initial reaction to the presentation)
- ""How many people are we talking about on those two teams?"" (to gather more information about the customer's team size and structure)
- ""What kind of questions does it bring up as we're looking at the screen right now?"" (to understand if there are any specific areas of concern or interest)
- ""How does this resonate with you?"" (to gauge the customer's overall impression of the presentation)
- ""What are the main areas of your program that you'd like to see supported?"" (to identify the customer's specific needs and requirements)
- ""Is there any distinction between like a kind of management type user?"" (to clarify the customer's understanding of the licensing structure)
- ""What do we need? What can we afford?"" (to understand the customer's budget constraints and priorities)
- ""What are the key priorities?"" (to ensure that the solution aligns with the customer's needs)
- ""Any feedback on this, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], to make sure we're going down the right path?"" (to ensure that the solution meets the customer's expectations)
- ""What exactly that would work, possibly?"" (to understand the customer's specific requirements for collaborative spaces)
- ""Any questions or initial reactions?"" (to gauge the customer's overall impression of the presentation)

These open-ended questions demonstrate that the sales rep is actively seeking to understand the customer's needs, concerns, and priorities. By asking these questions, the sales rep is able to tailor the presentation to the customer's specific requirements and build a stronger rapport with the customer."
video_19790_167_6qr3y000000g3O2AAI,"Agent: After Yeah, okay, so first of all, thank you for being here.
Agent: You Daniel.
Agent: I think that I already met some of you [DATE-1] during when you were in motion guys and we already saw together something around, you know, energy cloud and if I don't go wrong, I mean, you are currently using it for some aspects of your business.
Agent: So talking with [PERSON-1], We decided that [PERSON-2] was asking us to give some updates on the solution, on the vertical solution, and maybe also focus a little bit on the subscription management path.
Agent: The gap of data is that we can eventually leverage in energy that is proud to implement this subscription management. So, let me just, okay.
Agent: So that is the idea of the agenda, but obviously we can, we can be so much interactivists we need and let's try that and because maybe some of you already know part of the solution.
Agent: Some of you not, I'm not sure who is up to date to which level. So eventually we can skip or focus on other aspects based on what are your interests.
Agent: So as you know, I mean, the idea of the solution in general from sales forces with verticals is to provide a further step towards the final solutions to customers, in the sense that normally says what's our main product, the [PRODUCT-1] product, or say it's service Marketing and so on, is quite a general, so it can be used by many companies for different kinds of businesses.
Agent: And the approach was to, through acquisition, like the acquisition of velocity, that is the previous, the company that will bring it in some of the vertical, based software base, but also developing and increasing and improving the solution.
Agent: Successful services trying to produce us some verticals like the energy one that will reduce the amount of work you need to do to reach your objectives.
Agent: Some of the things are already there, like on the data model is extended, some processes are already presented with a template and so on and so forth. We will see.
Agent: So this is the objective of this vertical to reduce the time to... to the value that you're going to have with the projects .
Agent: If you have any general question on, on energy ground as a vertical, feel free to, to ask, I mean, me and [PERSON-3] will be glad to answer.
Agent: So, during [DATE-2], we have, every, every year we have three releases.
Agent: And the idea behind this is as face-forces in general is doing with the [PRODUCT-1] is to provide new capabilities, okay?
Agent: Following what is mostly the market need in the sense that we collect obviously requests from several customers and we have a team internally of product management that is trying to provide the new [PRODUCT-2] and the solution to, and there are also other kind of efforts not only from a product.
Agent: Point of view of improving and increasing the solution, but also to make it better and t o make it more standard.
Agent: So what is the meaning of this?
Agent: So say it's also in the latest, I think mostly in [DATE-3] . is trying to simplify and normalize the solution.
Agent: So if there is already a product or a sub product that is providing a functionality, says for us it's trying to say, OK, this is the solution. We will not build other solutions for the same aspect.
Agent: And this means as an example that, as an example, you remember, I don't know if you have seen us energy clouds, but that's an example. We'll also be provided.
Agent: Of a flex card or a card called the customer story. That is like the story about the operations that you did with the customer, the goals, the opportunities, the cases.
Agent: Now, because this was already another aspect, another gadget that is called the timeline, that is essentially the same thing. So, energy go out now is adopted the timeline. So, this is just to say normalization of the solution.
Agent: The other aspect is moving to core. This means that most of the modules and capabilities from energy to this cloud are being migrated technically into the platform.
Agent: So no more context classes, but [GPE-1] libraries and part of the [GPE-1] platform. And this is happening piece by piece, is not one shot, as you can imagine.
Agent: As an example, the other model is one aspect, and this part is integrated.
Agent: [PERSON-1] says, as first, stands for [ORG-1]. So let's see a little bit of truthless life.
Agent: So this is the last one, essentially after the acquisition, the salesforce decided to rename and brand the broader task energy in this cloud before that was just developed resolution. And then we started launching some new stuff at release.
Agent: We tried to highlight the main ones with bold charters, but essentially. There are several things that cannot be resumed in a single couple of slides.
Agent: So there has been an effort to start producing some already built applications for some use cases, like for use cases for call center agents or use cases for the customer acquisition through the digital portals, the self-service portals and so on and so on.
Agent: So [ORG-2] has produced some of these applications already done that you can [PERSON-4], welcome. And we would see some of them more in [DATE-4].
Agent: Then there is, as you, as [PERSON-1] was asking about, I saw first also a verticalization of field service. This means that the [ORG-2] horizontal solution for [ORG-3] has been increased with some new licenses and capabilities.
Agent: And as an example, you know, the most ingredients for [ORG-4] users, the contractors that are not using directly the [PRODUCT-1] to access also the extended data model. the building that is happening .
Agent: Go to the next slide . that is happening in the latest period of some prepared work cycles and mobile flows for typical field work from technical agents that are working on the field and so on.
Agent: So there is a set of licenses for [ORG-3] that is verticalized to allow you to provide those other energy discoveries like using an omni-script or accessing the model and so on.
Agent: Another thing that is quite relevant, probably you already are, if you are using the vertical you should know it, is that from [EVENT-1], we also have a launch into the program for automatic upgrades.
Agent: So this means that if you onboard on this program, you will not need to upgrade the managed package yourself for every version. But [ORG-2] will take care of upgrading the package.
Agent: Ok, so I don't know if you already know this or not. Okay.
Agent: Then what else?
Agent: There are some other things like we will see in the next slide, but essentially, you know, the roadmap is progressing. In [DATE-5], as I was saying, there are some main, obviously, investment pillars.
Agent: So one of them is to to go to code, okay, and this is really taking a lot of efforts from our engineers because I can't repeat what is.
Agent: Another model, all the APIs for the CPU as an example have been moved to code. Most of them are already moved.
Agent: What else?
Agent: The only studio, only studio, so the set of the like on-microcript cards and so on and so forth, is there is now a standard Code version that is just using Code objects. And it still exists the package version.
Agent: But obviously to adapt to energy ground to work completely with the core solution of our new studio, there has been and is still not finished [DATE-6].
Agent: I think [DATE-7], would be the final [ORG-5] of the solution and the fence. Because some of the technical aspects behind the velocity assets like the car for [ORG-6] or other aspects, they are not easy.
Agent: In the sense, they use namespaces, they use a lot of... Code behind it, so to adapt it to work with the [PERSON-5] s in the standard, it took like one year You should be done now We are just waiting
Speaker 4: For a go from product managemen t to say, let's say to the customer to [ORG-7] e to [PERSON-6] in the standard.net to you . Yes, actually.
Speaker 4: When you're saying that right now it's using namespaces, what will change because still will get [PRODUCT-3]: As a managed package, right?
Agent: So it's still it will be using the namespaces or will be changing the backend objects for [ORG-8]. No, well, OK, so from from a point of view of the managed package, yes, it's still there and.
Agent: Or it will be there for some time yet. Now there is a long term plan, we don't have timelines to remove it completely. Okay.
Agent: So at the moment, you have the package installed and you can choose if to use package on the studio like a nine space, you know, runtime, designer and so on, or the standard one.
Agent: Until the latest version, if you choose to go for standard, there are some limitations, there are some considerations in the documentation, say before doing it, check this, because maybe you are using something that is not still supported with standard.
Agent: But the effort to support everything is going on, and I hope that
Agent: [DATE-8] will be there on the target layer line.
Speaker 4: I believe that recharge already opted
Agent: In for the auto renewal. Yeah, that is already there. For the push upgrades. Yeah, yeah, okay, but that is not that process is not forcing you to choose standard only studio or package on the studio.
Agent: You decide they will not change anything my great to I don't know if I pronounce wrong to your name.
Speaker 4: Automatically. To migrate to
Agent: No, it's correct. That's okay. the migration to standard on this video takes some effort in the sense that you need to take several of the only scripts and cards and so on and send it tool.
Speaker 4: Through the migration
Agent: In a sense that it's not a one-click migration, okay?
Agent: It takes a little bit of time, unfortunately. The current, you know that, for a moment to the next slide.
Speaker 4: Let's go now
Agent: I mentioned the fact that there are some applications that are provided already built. So there is, after the goal, I can send you the documentation of scanning how to reach this.
Agent: Now, essentially, if you go on help.setsus.com for energy, it's probably you will find the instructions. So these applications are like a substitution for the old concept of process library. We don't have and maintain the process library anymore.
Agent: What we do is that we produce this application and we maintain and update and release these applications. As a separate set from the baggage, so they are not inside the managed baggage yet.
Agent: And you can access this algorithm, generate one org with this solution, and then evaluate if you like some of the parts of the thing is applicable to your business, you can just migrate.
Agent: There are instructions to migrate these solutions to your sandbox. And then from the sandbox, you modify, adjust, and release. And these are currently using a sort of mid- they're using a MySQL standard. already now.
Agent: But there is like a sort of mid middle time flag enabled saying support also the managed package on the studio.
Agent: So some of the parts of the assets are on the streets and flags cards are in the new version and some are still on the other side.
Agent: So that just to keep in mind in the case you want to adopt some of these solutions and migrate them. Okay, so this is more or less very high level situation at the moment.
Agent: Most of these models were already present at the time of when you adopted the energy cloud. So, as an example, the business models like [ORG-6], the product catalog and the other management.
Agent: I'm not sure if you are using the digital commerce module. I will explain to you what is this.
Agent: But it's essentially a set of APIs to expose the CPU capabilities on digital channels, on a scalable way and other capabilities.
Agent: But something that probably was not there and I don't know if you are informal about is a full set of industry, common components and our service excellence, [ORG-2] service We will see something.
Agent: But as an example, we did not within the CPU. Now we are also able to use the rules engine instead of the old calculation models and calculation procedures. The rules engine is the target solution where [ORG-9] is converting.
Agent: Sorry, it's directing everyone because it's containing the [ORG-10] to work on any object on [ORG-2] and this build some decision metrics that can be used in several areas and decision tables.
Agent: So it's similar to the idea of calculation, modeling, and calculation procedures, but it's more general and more powerful. It's called a business rules engine.
Agent: Currently, if you look up your own, I am quite sure and you look up the licenses. and the permission set licenses that you have.
Agent: You wouldn't notice that you have a lot of permission set licenses that you probably are not using. The latest that was released was like [PRODUCT-1] analytics.
Agent: That is a successful product for [PERSON-7] data analytics that has been automatically given to everyone that has energy in this cloud because it's part of the new releases.
Agent: But also you will notice things like the arc that is like the relationship center, that is substituting the old velocity graphs or you know, are there no action templates, that is like the action plans, that is a way to establish something place for action plan that would be used to generate tasks for people working on some specific applications and reverse notes.
Agent: So there are seven things that obviously we cannot see all of them, but.. . And by the way, the list of these applications. So we have one application for all of them are in the same arc.
Agent: So if you go and generate an argument, you will find all of them. But the documentation is in different chapters. So there is a full set of processes and solution for the Customer409 contact center console for the agent.
Agent: There is a solution that is being improved now with the new capabilities for the customer acquisition portal. Thank you.
Agent: Full flow using the digital commerce to acquire an anonymous mode, a new account, create an order and so on and so forth with a portal built on obviously an experienced cloud. So it's fun.
Agent: There is an application for large accounts management.
Agent: So I don't know if this part of the capability is being used a lot of the moment in [ORG-13], but the CPU has been improved in the latest versions with some dedicated flows and data model to manage multi-site quotes and orders.
Agent: So if you have like customers in large accounts that are asking for.
Agent: I don't know, here, installing chargers, as an example, in several places, you can quote all of them together, okay?
Agent: And then have a sort of structural master quote and some quotes with groups, like you can say, okay, for this CD, for these 10 service points, I will deliver this charger, with this subscription, with this product and service.
Agent: And for this other group, it will be different. And then this can be attributed eventually with external pricing engine if you need it, and so on and so forth. And this flows through from now.
Agent: Code to order, so you can then generate order for each service point of order for the group and so on . And this application, the larger accounts as management is providing a console dedicated to managing the large account.
Agent: These are self-supporting, completely built with [PRODUCT-4] cards and the new studio capabilities and the current to adopt the, I don't remember the clear name, but [DATE-9], let's say experience model that is completely renewed and essentially is exposing the data and the processes for self-service for consumer accounts.
Agent: So this portal is providing you an example on how to build a self-service portal with, on with [ORG-13]. to access your bills, your consumption, change of service, or things like that.
Agent: And this one instead is a new set of capabilities around the energy efficiency of clean. I mean, in general, I'm not restricted to clean energy, but program management.
Agent: So the gap ability to, that has been hard, that the two energy described in the latest couple of versions and I think it's [ORG-5] now completely with the food solution that includes the possibility to build the full capabilities to manage energy programs.
Agent: So as an example, energy community, so you know, new energy, clean energy programs, where you can market the campaign, you can expose to digital channels of these programs and onboard new customers, you can track internally and also from a customer point of view, as an example, the CO2 settings, and it has a soft, you know, cardboard.
Agent: Footprint and savings respect to [ORG-17] for solar panel s of new talk .
Agent: We can go more in [DATE-4], but it's related to the possibility to manage programs through the digital channels, and hold the data model behind the scenes to track and manage the program internally. Okay.
Agent: So time is running a lot from. So what I want to say, we can do. I have some other slide, but probably maybe one thing is about digital commerce that you don't know, that we can.
Agent: But then what I was thinking is, I have a demo that is essentially the same demo that we use at the. [DATE-10], if you want to see some ideas around subscription.
Agent: But maybe most of you already saw this demo, and there is also a video around. So you tell me if you want to see the demo.
Agent: The other thing is showing you the differences between, or let's say the differences, the innovations, in the sense that we're talking about the new, only studio new customer 409, new capability for the [ORG-6].
Agent: There is a new card, because there is a new card for [ORG-6] that I don't know if you are using it or not, and things like that. So that is also an aspect that we can see.
Agent: And, I'm just realizing the damage is very short. So we can do it this through the demo.
Agent: In the sense, we can see some part of the demo, and then I will tell you when something is different now, and that we should in the new console and the new solution.
Agent: Or we can go buy questions to use the rest of the drive. So let me just give you an idea of what is digital commerce.
Agent: So digital commerce is, as I was saying, a set of APIs for exposing CPU capabilities to the digital channels. The idea is we don't want to execute to run for every single call because it's too slow.
Agent: One second is too much for a digital channel with a massive number of users navigating it.
Agent: So there is a set of APIs and there is an architecture based on a file server that will prepare the answers in a sort of way so that if you think to the final of navigation of the users like most of the users are pressing your website and seeing all the offers.
Agent: Only some of them will select one of the offers and only some of them will configure some of the dates and only some of them will as an example buy the offer. All of them.
Agent: Api request to do this operation . The answer to this API request is already prepared in advance by [ORG-2].
Agent: So it's immediate, okay?
Agent: It's just accessing our document in a file server and getting new the JSON reports for these combination of events of what it was an answer, okay?
Agent: And this is also supporting anonymous navigations. So it doesn't need, these APIs are exposed both through the communities or through portal from your site. also to anonymous navigation.
Agent: So anonymous user can ask the [ORG-10] to give me the offer, give me the details of this offer and so on and so forth.
Agent: So the full idea is It needs to be scalable and so for large peaks of rigorous and it needs to support non-musnavigation.
Agent: And so if you want to expose the catalog, the subscriptions and the charges to the digital channels, this is the way to go, okay, without replicating website or somewhere
Speaker 5: The catalog on the else.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-8] may ask a question. Absolutely. About the digital commerce. It still would be good maybe to hear more on the use cases.
Speaker 5: So you just said we can expose subscriptions and products into the digital channels without building the separate touch points, web touch points, applications. I still don't fully understand the use case.
Speaker 6: Maybe you could share a bit more ideas how we can be applied. But eventually, selling them [PERSON-9], it's not about post sale.
Speaker 6: It's just if someone wants to buy certain products, we basically have this catalog of products where we define, you know, name other features price. And then we can expose them, for example, on a website.
Speaker 6: And then people can buy it. That's the first part. I don't think it has this, because this is a digital commerce related thing.
Speaker 5: I don't think it has anything to do with
Agent: Post sale.
Speaker 6: What happens?
Speaker 6: That's to do it for the understand.
Speaker 6: There's an API in [ORG-2], we would be able to add all the products that we need, via the API we expose them and we can integrate them on a website if we need to sell products.
Speaker 6: So let's say if we would be selling charge points on a website directly, then we can expose those details about the charge points via the API.
Agent: Yeah, I think [PERSON-10] is showing here.
Agent: As an example, this is a community, you know, okay?
Agent: And this one that we are seeing when I press New Gasmer is an old omniscript.
Agent: An omniscript, I don't know if you know, exactly what it is but it's a sequence of steps that you can design currently, currently if you, if you, this is a new org, okay, with the new version of the energy release cloud and as an example this is an on-script.
Agent: So you come here and use, you put here some you know actions or some screens, some fields and so on and so forth.
Agent: So you define a flow very, very easily and then you can expose this on any channel, let's say on [ORG-2] agents, on communities, or we don't, given that it's compiling our [ORG-17], our web component, it would be running any browser page together inside another [ORG-18] or another portal, okay?
Agent: And when this only scripts is running here, and it reaches this step, okay?
Agent: Sorry. is not, I mean the Omelet script is not contained in this definition of products. These are coming from the... energy grab catalog and [ORG-6].
Agent: And our own script or your website or any other mobile operation can know this. It's doing an API call.
Agent: But this API call, as an example, is saying, I am from this channel, and I don't know, passing some context information and say, give me the offer, which are the offer, which is the description, what is the image, or what is the price, and what will be the price.
Agent: This [ORG-17] is not, it's from digital commerce, [ORG-17] said, and it's not running the [ORG-6] as if you are in a cart configuring a normal.
Agent: It's just giving you back the answer immediately because it's pretty often needed, okay?
Agent: So this kind of architecture can, as [PERSON-1] was saying, it's for sales. It's for sales. The sales can also be a not-great sales, so that cross sales.
Agent: So as an example, a customer is already having a charger, and wants to buy another service or you have a subscription. and you want to improve the subscription level or things like that.
Agent: So you can still use digital comments. But it's an architecture to leverage the catalog. So the product catalog that you define, and I would say, a pricing engine and
Speaker 6: The CPU, but in a scalable way. So if I go, Maybe the important piece is that this is mostly relevant for self-serve, for the sales-led process [PERSON-9], which is a lot of what we do.
Speaker 5: Not
Speaker 6: If customers
Speaker 5: Themselves would go and purchase something on the website, that is when using these APIs would be helpful. But for example, we have got it in take where customers open and choose what they want.
Agent: Could it be suitable for us if we develop new got it in take?
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 5: Yeah. And the sense
Agent: That you say that during the intake of the customer is choosing between different offers or configuring an offer. Yeah. Yeah, it's still a self-service, let's say, buy or say, process.
Agent: So, this demo from [DATE-13], was a bit too big to see demo, in the sense that the idea was, okay, you ever... partner that is accessing the partner portal with a customer in front of him and say, okay, this guy wants to buy and there is a contract with your partner.
Speaker 4: One, this old
Agent: So he knows they know they have [PERCENT-1] discount. This is on the product catalog on the contract. Okay.
Agent: But then when, obviously, going to the next step, we had like an email sent to the customer and the customer was doing the intake. but during the intake is just configuring some details.
Agent: This was done with an Omelet script also. If you want, I can show it to you, but essentially it's another Omelet script where the customer is configuring some of these details. Okay. This could be done also again.
Agent: With digital commerce. In the sense that behind the on-script, you can also cool the digital commerce APIs. Maybe you want to show additional options or options. I can use an additional service. or you want to price options.
Agent: So as an example, you want to price that in this case, it was like the color or the mounting type. This kind of things could be also priced, and then they intake with the digital commerce. OK.
Agent: The only thing is that they intake portal should run integrated with the APIs to [ORG-2], OK?
Agent: Yeah. I don't know, really, if you do want to go through the old demo and see the flow.
Agent: So maybe you got ideas on what you want to see or you want to see the new stuff and energy out.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-13], I have a quick question because when we set up the the demo, I also particularly mentioned that I would be interested in seeing what's developed in regards to subscriptions, how we can manage product for sale and also after sale.
Agent: Intention of having
Speaker 6: If the demo is from [DATE-10], I think this requirement is not included there.
Speaker 6: So what I would be interested in seeing is everything related to subscriptions, so I'm wondering what can you show in regards to that?
Agent: Okay, so this, let me just take one. Okay, in this demo already, but then I can show you also in the product design that's something in the new version.
Agent: And this demo was already using, how to say, subscriptions in the [ORG-17].
Agent: At the level of catalog, What we defined at the time was a subscription and [ORG-18] okay charges and subscription they were to separated offense but when Obviously when starting the on when the only script is Creating the org the opportunity It was creating the opportunity with both products.
Agent: Okay, so I don't know if it is readable or it's too small But so in this idea This is a card, okay, so it's like an opportunity, an order being taken for a specific custom, okay?
Agent: It's not the configuration of the subscription itself, it's the selling on the subscription. So as you can see, you can define products and bundles, and you can define regarding pricing.
Agent: You can define multi-brice, or you can define in-ibrice and things like that. And then you can also define, I would say, like, expected, you know.
Agent: End of subscription if it is like something that is allowed to renew it or not. And the baggage in this case, so the charger was a separate product.
Agent: But no one, I mean, you can decide that if you want to bundle things together in the sense, You can decide if it is like a top-down approach.
Agent: So in the sense, I sell this bundle that contains subscriptions and contain charges. And eventually, the customer can choose the options.
Agent: So which charger or which level of subscription?
Agent: Because you can control this with several rules in the CPU. You can decide to, for example, provide a cardinality saying, OK, if you buy the baggage, you need to include a [ORG-17] subscription.
Agent: So this is like bundling things from the start and going up top-down approach. I'm selling packages that are containing everything.
Agent: The other possibility is to define rules so that when I have a customer that has a like, as buying a charger, you can give the option or you can for the same to also buy a subscription.
Agent: There is a knock in the same bundle. But with the [ORG-6], from industry, you can define rules cross products.
Agent: You can say as an example, if I have this kind of subscription, or the baggage will be of this level, or this service will be included also, this kind of rules to automatically, you know, force or drive the cart can be done.
Agent: So, [PERSON-13], from the point of view of... That's what ?
Agent: Simply defining the author and defining the products for subscription is quite, I don't know if there is something in this part that you have questions about because there are, in the subscription management there are several aspects, you know, so it's like defining the offers, combining, you know, them together, pricing them, and then then to end, it also includes,
Speaker 6: You know, activating the subscription, billing the subscription and so on and so forth. So I don't know which interested on, but...
Agent: Aspect you are more
Speaker 6: I posted a list of questions in the chat on the aspects that I'm interested in because of course the sale part is important.
Speaker 6: I think we can see it here for how to add things, how to change the pricing if needed. Bundling is also a separate subject we will bundle things.
Agent: Because sometimes maybe
Speaker 6: Sometimes we want to sell things separately. So I don't We're still much on that want to focus.
Agent: But the three questions that I posted in the cha t would be the most relevant Okay, so the first one is now can we manage sorry, how can we configure subscription product s and what changes ?
Agent: Okay, how you can do it is now, I don't know if you're using it already or not, but now we have the product designer. Okay, so you can define all the different aspects of one offer and a product.
Agent: And essentially if I define a subscription, apart from the of the type, the family blah, and the description, Obviously, you can define attributes and so on and so forth.
Speaker 4: Definition
Agent: It's around pricing, you know. So because you need to also define a regarding price for the subscription, or you can also define both things.
Agent: You can define an activation price plus a regarding So within the pricing tab, you can add different kind of prices.
Speaker 4: Price. Okay.
Speaker 6: This is should be loaded in some kind of a little bit slow.
Speaker 6: And besides pricing, can we define for the same product different types of building schedules?
Speaker 6: Let's say we have a gold subscription, which a customer can buy [DATE-13] or [DATE-17]. But it's the same product. Basically, it's just a different building cycle. And of course, it might have a different price.
Speaker 4: And we
Agent: Set that up here. Yeah, I want to say, let me just take one product to this. I don't understand why this is not loading the prices. Yeah, okay, you can define [DATE-17] or [NORP-1] pricing.
Speaker 4: The choice, sorry, someone is rising an M or?
Speaker 4: Yeah, before you proceed, I just want to say one thing. So we are actually using attributes to define whether the subscription product
Speaker 4: And then using those attributes to decide how it will be built. But if there is anything else that we can use,
Agent: No, well, you mean from up, because we need to distinguish
Speaker 6: A little bit between quote, a face and a billing face, okay?
Speaker 4: The sales or
Speaker 6: So... billing will be done by your billing agent.
Agent: The
Speaker 6: I don't know which one. Correct. Yeah. So it will be done separately, but we can use some details about it. The actual operation of the billing is done separately.
Speaker 6: But how to do the billing or how often can be something that we set up here, because at the moment of sale, we also want to inform the customer that, hey, you know, you
Agent: Chose for the [DATE-17] or for the [DATE-13] billing. And then that can be used. in other downstream systems and other products .
Agent: Yeah, so you need the, I think you need the information in the, in the moment you prepare the order, while you specify, so this could be an attribute, okay, it could be like an attribute saying, the price will happen [DATE-17] or [DATE-13], sorry, the pricing.
Agent: And this is useful for the billing engine, okay, because you pass down an attribute or you pass down, you can, if you want, you can also, I don't know if you're using all the management, but you can also decompose the commercial order and add line items.
Agent: You can add, if your billing system doesn't accept an attribute and they want a line item in the order, you can also automatically add a line item. So this is just to align the billing.
Agent: From a point of view of definition, when you define the pricing here, you have like price list elements. So, as an example, there are different elements. So, you can define an [DATE-13] price and a multiple price.
Agent: And then you can drag and drop here rules. So, you could define a rule saying if the attribute is for pricing is [DATE-13], then this price is valid. During the [PERSON-17], we are still at the [PERSON-17] here.
Agent: If the attribute is like [DATE-17], then the other price. So, This box here, where you can take a rule and drop it there, is a way to have multiple different prices and just choose which one we'll apply.
Agent: So you can define a context rule to identify if it is ill or [DATE-17], and that will drive the selection of the price on the rotation time.
Agent: And the same attribute can be passed down to the billing, or to 13 the billing act in the correct way, so in the sense that we'll apply the correct scheduling for the bills and the calculations.
Agent: This is one easy way for this example requirement. Obviously, the pricing in here at the quotation time can also happen in another way. There is a there is a pricing that is called attribute pricing.
Agent: Okay, so when the CPU is running during the water or hotbed building, is a product thing called a pricing plan. Okay, pricing plan
Speaker 4: Is a sequence of steps. Now, let me see if I can show you.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, using it. So.
Speaker 4: Yeah, also, it's actually for the sake of understanding of everyone. I will just show. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Agent: So when you add some products in the cart, all the prices calculated. This price, the pricing plan is executed.
Agent: So this means that there are some standard steps, okay, like load the price of [DATE-10], apply contact to the <inaudible>, blah, blah.
Agent: And it's like a waterfall, OK?
Agent: So things are happening in sequence. But you can, and normally, these things are provided by sites of itself. You can download these procedures and add it here. You can add some steps here.
Agent: And in this case, as an example, for the demo, or this step is calculating the price for some data. of boiler or let's say warming plant for the house, this is calculating some other price.
Agent: So what this means that is taking the product, taking the car, taking all the attributes and doing some logic with business rules engine or with the old calculation procedure. and calculating the price dynamically without using average or code.
Agent: These procedures behind these steps are applying some more complex logic. If the product is pricing by these steps, it will not be over-read and by the other steps. You have these two different options, what I wanted to highlight.
Agent: You can define different prices on the price list.
Agent: And assign a rule to decide which one will apply, or you can leave the pricing for those particular products and subscriptions to our procedure, the business rules engine, that is very powerful and can really use the attributes and other fields from [ORG-2] to calculate the price.
Agent: As an example, to give you more complex examples, there are these, the attribute pricing is used for situations very complex like target margin pricing.
Agent: As an example, the agent is putting the margin in an attribute in the card saying, I want to do [PERCENT-2] margin.
Agent: We go to this category is also getting not only in the price, but also the cost, you know, and the. The attribute price is in book using this value [PERCENT-2] to calculate which should be the price you should
Agent: Sell the product to the customer. So it's very powerful and you, sorry, I know, I didn't see your problem. I was just, I just wanted to ask a question [PERSON-10] also mentioned that she's using this already.
Agent: Because
Agent: And to ask [PERSON-17] because she had those three questions like.
Agent: Is it clear how you can configure subscription products and how you can use triggers for activation?
Speaker 6: I think we didn't yet talk about the activations. So in our maybe to answer one of those question, Thank you.
Speaker 6: In our previous calls, I did mention that I saw from the team some demos for how to use things.
Speaker 6: So I think that's what also [PERSON-18] is referring to because we are using this for different types of products and also for subscriptions. But I don't think we are using it to the full potential that we can.
Speaker 6: And of course, we want to understand if maybe something changed in the meantime that we also don't know.
Speaker 6: Because It could be that you, for example, from a product direction, decided to have more informatio n about the billing as standard fields or properties that exist for products, for example, if the y are subscription products, and we use them as a custom attribute So those are also the nuances that we want to understand
Agent: If maybe we are using thing s in the right way, or there's a better way for how to do that . Yeah, I mean, no.
Agent: In this aspect, there has not been a big changes, apart from introducing the business through [PERSON-17] and [ORG-17].
Agent: Well, the recommendation is if attributes are very better, if you don't need 10 line items, because the other approach is to define, sub products inside the bundle, technical products, to pass this information to the billion.
Agent: But attributes and fields are probably more, how to say, dynamic and configurable. And the attribute price in engine is working on attributes and fields. So it's the way to go, I think you're doing the right thing.
Agent: If this is working with your building, in the sense that you don't need to add other products inside the bundle just for the building, then attribute is the right choice.
Agent: And I don't know if this answers your question, I don't know about here, but I think attribute to, I don't know which other information from the building you have in mind, but, way, the attribute is a good way to characterize the broadened so that it can be sold and be lived in the right way.
Agent: And then how to trigger a subscription activation?
Agent: I mean, when you define, when you go on after you sell something like a subscription, the process is passing through the creation of...
Agent: I would say, are you using all the management guys or not?
Agent: Because all the management is the other feature, not the two we have. that is working after the sales phase. So it's decomposing the order into technical elements.
Agent: So you can add and decompose this order producing additional information for the different systems and then orchestrate all the flows.
Agent: So you can invoke like other systems in a synchronous or as in [GPE-2], you can assign tasks and so on and so forth.
Agent: And this is where... You can also logic without coding to decide the dates of activation, and when to inform, as an example, the billing to start a billing for the customer and so on and so forth.
Speaker 4: Apply
Agent: If you are not using the management, obviously, you need to build something custom, because... the, I would say you have the possibility to decide the date for the order, but it's one date for all the line items.
Agent: So if you sell a charger, you need to ship it and then you need to activate, start activating the subscription, after the installation and the activation of the charger.
Agent: This kind of dependency needs to be managed manually or with the custom development. Hot-term management is said they're able to do this in the sense that you, you can just define the, on the plants.
Agent: Maybe, maybe if you want, if you are interested in hot-term management, we can do a dedicated session, so I can show you the go-up business, but that this is the main scope of hot-term management.
Speaker 6: So, managing the, the activation, the fulfillment of the different aspects of the sales order once submitted to the system.
Speaker 4: So, a quick question to you regarding disorder management. Are these the orders that we are using
Speaker 6: Or is it something different?
Speaker 7: Order
Agent: Management uses those orders, but it's a completely different process. We are not using anything related to order management. Okay, yeah.
Agent: The object is the standard audit, but then obviously the management has capabilities and uses some other, let's say, object to maintain the fulfillment request and the situation of the frustration and so on.
Agent: And so this is also related to your latest question, [PERSON-13], what happens in post sales?
Agent: What solution for managing the infirmities of the management?
Agent: And then post sales also means having assets. So if you go to any of these accounts, at the end you have some active assets as an example.
Agent: This is the new console, okay?
Agent: A little bit more respect to the respect. to the Odu tens . that you see is very poor and very old, you know, it has been avoided a lot.
Agent: And, but anyway, you have the assets, okay, these are customers, for example, as I do a few, then as a charger install, and in the asset level, okay, this is a cut, but if I go to the record, did you see the full, the full records?
Agent: If I take one of the existing assets, so,
Agent: You can define the asset level all the details, like the kind of products when it was activated, when it's expired in case of a subscription, what is the price, what is it's stolen, and so on and so forth.
Agent: And the asset is the place where you maintain the subscription. Okay. And then you should the energy cloud solution is providing capabilities to. upsell or renew the subscription, or change the offer level through the [ORG-6] depends.
Agent: I mean, if you need [ORG-6] to calculate New Pricing or things like that, then [ORG-6] is involved with other <inaudible> you have just like renewing the contractor.
Agent: This processes are, you already have templates around this process as an explanation and I'll do it, but it's possible to focus in on the asset, maintain all the boss sales processes, okay?
Agent: If you want like, if the customer is like wants to cancel the subscription or if you need to renew it and so on and so forth.
Agent: Given the time is very short, I just, I don't know, the other thing is also you, I think, Obviously, I
Speaker 5: Am sure you have a lot of questions that we need to manage to answer this. [PERSON-17], maybe one comment from my site. We are now using [PRODUCT-5]. Well, not everywhere. We just bought it in the [GPE-3].
Speaker 5: We already bring some nice opportunities, but still, I would say, our business team is hunger to see more. And I know that, and I fully support [PERSON-1], which [DATE-17]'s topic about subscription.
Speaker 5: Don't want to stall time for that [DATE-17].
Speaker 5: It would be good if we probably plan something else to learn more about order management, order fulfillment, what we see now on the screen, how it can complement energy cloud features on the functionalities.
Agent: I consider that the energy cloud is quite independent, but I think that's the answer. If you want, we have alpha now, still.
Speaker 5: If you want, we can see it now. But only if it fits to the main topic of [DATE-17]'s meeting, I see. I saw [PERSON-1]'s questions, three questions in the chat.
Agent: If they are covered, we can go if not, I would... Yeah, [PERSON-1] also asked us [DATE-18] some experience from other customers, maybe... So we have a lot of customers.
Agent: I remember because in [GPE-4], that our [ORG-25] story that would be published very soon is around the disk customer here.
Agent: It is a subsidiary company from an L, there is the merger energy provider in [GPE-4]. This company.
Agent: Sorry to interrupt you, but before you start, I just want to quickly ask [PERSON-1] how she would like to proceed because last time we scheduled this meeting, you also asked for a reference case for customer, see how other customers are using it in different industry and while you've mentioned like them electricity or energy industry relates most to you.
Agent: I just want to know if we should cover that and if.
Speaker 6: We also covered the questions you had in regards before we start this session. So I think the two other things, but I will make an assumption.
Speaker 6: So regarding the triggers, if we want to define various conditions for activating the subscription, let's say we activate upon payment, or reactivate
Agent: The subscription the subscription upon charge point installation. My answer is that we can use attributes for that. I can answer you quickly to this, Sotrian. So from a [ORG-6], we'll cut our point of view.
Agent: When you are in the public designer, you define the prices. Okay. You've been here. Let me see what it is. Come on. Let me try it, well, I've done you guys. There is a way to define time plans.
Agent: And time, let me let me see it here. [ORG-26] plans, point one, so long. [ORG-26] plans and time policies, okay.
Agent: This means you can decide As an example, when is the starting event?
Agent: Okay.
Agent: You can see there is an example here. So as an example, this one is from [DATE-17] to the end of plan. Okay. All you can decide that is from the first building.
Agent: This is obvious, not showing the diamond plants in the right way. Ah, this should be here, oh, I'm not here. Ah, sorry, it's in the glass in the same
Agent: Way. This is a diamond plant, and a tiny pole is this. Oh, come on.
Agent: So you say, as an example, the start time is the purchase date, but this could be like the first billing date, or [DATE-17].
Agent: So you can customize or configure these elements, okay?
Agent: And also the end time. And then you associate the policy with also with the plan.
Agent: So one plan is like the duration, okay?
Agent: So as an example, this one is for [DATE-18] in terms of [DATE-17], but you could define different duration.
Agent: When you define a price within the catalog, you can also, or a discount or any kind of pricing element, you can associate a time-plan and a time policy. Okay, this is still a configuration.
Agent: And as I said, you say, this is happening on the catalog, and then this information can be passed down to the building. So the building will know when to start the building of the...
Agent: And the other answer is using all the management in the sense that without the management, you can define more complex logic to decide when to start the subscription.
Agent: So from a point of view of defining information for the pricing, for the billing, you have time clients and time policies. From a point of view of physical, let's say, real activation of the first time, management.
Agent: You can use all the
Agent: I don't remember if I ever plan here, but I don't think so.
Agent: But essentially, the plan is like, okay, after this, in this demo was after this, the selection is confirmed of the charger, then start also the subscription building and activate the subscription. Without the management, you
Agent: Can do this kind of... So, just to clarify, right now they don't have order management in use, so, to trigger the subscription activation, they can use time plans and time policies, which is already available for them.
Agent: And they can also use order management for that. They have an extended use of capabilities, but it's in the order management piece, which is now not available for them. Just distinguish those two. What's available, you, [PERSON-18].
Agent: And what's not available. Okay, yeah.
Agent: Thank We'll talk to you soon. Okay,
Speaker 5: Yeah. Anuk and saying available for them, you mean us, [ORG-28], our sales team.
Speaker 6: Okay, clear. Anything that means we have
Speaker 4: Not purchased it.
Speaker 5: Yeah, we don't have the license.
Speaker 5: For all the management, you mean?
Speaker 5: Yeah. But Anuk, what you just said, there are two options either to use this What is what is called time frames, not time.
Agent: Policies, policies or the management.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. And to clarify With time two things and time policies, you work on a specific product like, I don't know, the subscription itself.
Speaker 5: A little bit, what is the difference?
Agent: So you define a time plan and time policy for the subscription. Without the management, you can instead define a logic that is based on the order for film. To give you the same example.
Agent: So if you as an example are getting a new account in your [PERSON-17] that is applying for a new charger and for a subscription.
Agent: And you want to say, look, I will need to do all the steps to visit the customer, ship the charger and install it and verify it's active.
Agent: And then I want to start the activation of the subscription afterwards, and then I want to start the billing afterwards. This kind of dependence, this kind of logic for the full progress, can only be defined without the manager.
Agent: It's not something you can do with that time plan or time policy.
Agent: The time plan and time policy is just for the single product, okay?
Agent: It's just defining a model of
Speaker 5: Pricing and that you can use for activation for the single product. So with all the management, it's more naturally embedded into the customer
Agent: Journey of furthering, if I can say like that. And, And yeah, and it's accelerated in the Dine 2 market for the new [PRODUCT-6] and offers because it's dynamically built in the plan, depending on some rules.
Agent: So if [DATE-17] you want to bundle as an example, the same charger with a different subscription or with additional services, you don't need to rebuild the full plan. You just combine together the things in the catalog.
Agent: And the other management will take care to analyze the composition of the commercial order and decide which is the flow to follow up and when to activate and subscription, for example.
Agent: As we were saying, maybe we can do a dedicated session for the management because it's, or we can start seeing something now to give you on a level of what is it.
Speaker 5: If I may very quickly, silly question, you mentioned [ORG-8] as an instrument, as part of [PRODUCT-5], we discussed it before. And also, order fulfillment module provides kind of a workflow.
Speaker 5: And if I'm not mistaken, [ORG-8] also provides automation via customized workflow. can we use instead [ORG-8] to build a proper order flow and also support subscription activation triggers and renewal triggers.
Agent: How they match each other, only studio and all the fulfill. No, I'm only studio contains only scripts for defining flows. Okay, but an only script is an interactive flow.
Agent: It's not something that is can run standalone on a server. It's just a flow that runs on customer engagement channels, or agent in front of the agent or in front of the customer. Okay, I'm the browser.
Agent: The other management is that gives you the ability to define long running or long term orchestration plans. And it will run,
Agent: One process could [DATE-25] and will be giving you the capability to wait. for an update from our channel or from another system, and then decide which step to do, assign tasks to other people.
Agent: So it's really from an architectural point of view of the solution is completely different aspect.
Agent: So I'm going to skip this just to define a session with steps for a user, like different forms, collecting information, showing you some offers.
Speaker 4: And loading documents so it's an interactive thing running on the browser. [PERSON-9] just to let you know [ORG-28] is something that we use like the tech team used to. give use of the guided.
Speaker 4: Those the one that you see for frame contract right now. It's built
Speaker 5: On.
Speaker 5: I think, actually, I understand you. We do not hear you well. Sometimes it's breaking your voice. But what I've heard that we are all the users in only [ORG-18], or we're going to use it journey, for
Speaker 4: For the sales our inside sales users.
Speaker 7: And it will also be useful multi-contract delivery. Yeah, we are using it. At [DATE-26], we develop.
Agent: Anyhow. Go ahead. We develop on top of the next.
Agent: Yes, unfortunately, your voice is breaking, but I think the message, I think that was clear here. So, if I go to
Agent: One of the accounts here, so an obvious clip is like a process that is running on a sales channel or could be also for the services. So, as I simply say here, I don't know, claim.
Agent: Let's see if it works. So the thing that is starting now is an omni-script. So it's a guided process for the user. It could be an internal user or an external user. But it's self-contained within the user session.
Agent: It's not something that runs behind the scenes for [DATE-28], waiting for something or synchronizing with other systems without user interaction. Instead, the order management is doing this.
Agent: Order management is setting up a full-on orchestration plan when you submit an order as an example.
Agent: They compose the order to multiple elements, and then we start. create the plan and automatically send in the steps forward. Okay, let me show you.
Agent: But before doing this, as [ORG-25] was mentioning, [PERSON-1], you also asked about one other customer story, or
Speaker 6: Maybe some reference, so I don't know what we want to do first now in [TIME-1].
Speaker 6: Do we want to see a little bit of this story?
Speaker 6: Or we want to go to show a little bit of the management?
Speaker 6: So regarding the customer, what I mentioned last time is particularly I'm interested to see examples of customers that have both a subscription and hardware elements. So if this fits the profile, we can take a quick look.
Agent: And then maybe we can see if we have time to look at order management. I think our meeting is until 13. So we only have [TIME-2]. No, OK.
Agent: The story that we provided is about this customer called Grisper ties. That is an another company. What they are doing is they produce meters and other hardware devices. for the energy distributors around [LOC-1].
Agent: So, the customers are green doberados. Small or medium or green doberados. So, they are like this, they sell the artwork, but obviously they sell it also other products. like services and support and so on and so forth.
Agent: And this includes regarding, you know, subscription-based services and one-time price services. So one of our services.
Agent: And they started, I think it was like, [DATE-28], now they are live from some time, at the beginning they had a lot of, you know, [ORG-28], you know, and a lot of manual operations.
Agent: And they adopted the energy in this cloud. There has been like a project that in [DATE-18], bring it to, to, to be live with the full end to end solution in the sense.
Agent: Not only the selling, but also, you know, the provisioning, the billing, all the part of your own prospecting.
Agent: So we can, if you want, also put you in contact with the our team because the, the main project was driven also with our group of [ORG-34].
Agent: Okay, so we have very good insights and knowledge about some questions.
Speaker 6: Yes, sorry for interrupting you, [PERSON-10].
Speaker 6: I am wondering if you have any customer examples where it's a combination of software and hardware because for an energy provider in this case, I'm not sure how the subscription fits in their scenario because Of course, they can have an energy contract, but for us, a subscription is something different.
Speaker 6: It is tied to the hardware, of course. but it is tied to other services that we offer as well.
Speaker 6: So for example, a subscription can say you have access to a certain feature in the software or not or a certain service that we offer or not, which is information that afterwards is used in other software systems.
Speaker 6: So what we are also interested in is how those things are managed because yeah, of course, for exampl e This information can be stored in the plan when we define it initially.
Speaker 6: But those things are exposed via the Commerce API.
Speaker 6: Is there a better way in which we can expose those features and attributes about the subscriptions that are sold or ready to a customer?
Speaker 6: So that they can be used by other systems.
Speaker 6: So I think I'm not sure if they have this aspect, but that is a little bit the aspect that we are interested in because yes, we have the hardware, but after the hardware is sold, there are other things that we consistently offer as part of the
Agent: Offering of a subscription to customers.
Agent: Yeah, I think from what I know, they also sell software and services because they sell apart from services like people, services in the sense, engineer, expertise or people that can support the final customer with the building of the solution and so on and so forth.
Agent: They also sell software. That is why I think this a customer, this experience is something quite near to what you need to do.
Agent: And the other reason why we selected this is also because we have a lot of information on this. But obviously, we are not to go.
Agent: In [DATE-4] of the aspects you are mentioning, like which [ORG-10] or which architecture solution was used to expose this on the different channels, which other elements they consider that we need.
Agent: To put you in contact with the team or with someone from the team that delivered this and built this for the customer because we personally have an eye level overview.
Agent: I know this is like the catalog in the sense they sell hardware and they sell services and they sell software. We're also part of this product in a subscription model.
Agent: And they built everything, you know, which says for us and with the energy described, they are not selling energy, okay, they are selling the hardware and services, okay, and software.
Agent: So if you think that, I think that the level of complexity and the kind of use case is not exactly your case but it's very near.
Speaker 6: So maybe what we're going to do is try to organize a session with our people that work on project.
Agent: The
Speaker 6: Is it this company that I shared the link to?
Speaker 6: Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 5: I'll take a look at what they're offering is on the website. Yeah. Okay. Good.
Speaker 5: But also, I think [PERSON-17] was a good idea to have this option, to have a call being organized with the team who delivered this project to this company, to learn more from them.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-13], I think we should consider it
Agent: When needed to learn more. I would be happy to join to listen.
Agent: Yeah, they also have another aspect that I, if I ever understood the last time with the conversation with the governor, you don't have to dislike the shade, the supply chain, in the sense they, they also take direct care of the, the provision, sorry, the, the bid hearing and change for the other, okay, so they do not build anything.
Agent: The companies not building me that's a hard work, but they have provided my partners. And so these companies mostly be to be okay.
Agent: So these companies sells large amount of other services and my subscription and so on in a long term scenario. So they say, okay, we do a contract with our customers for [DATE-25].
Agent: In the, in the during [DATE-28], we need to provide this amount of hardware, with this amount of services in this, with this schedule. Okay.
Agent: So it's, this part of complexity about supply chain may be, you don't have to manage, but it could be also, yeah, something that is in, or interest for you or not. But yeah, I agree.
Agent: So, [PERSON-17], if you give a look and you realize that this could apply or could be a meaningful use case, maybe.
Agent: It shouldn't be a problem to organize a direct [LAW-1] between you and our people, our experts, that work a lot more.
Agent: We only have left like [TIME-3] or so, I don't know if it's enough [PERSON-25] and him to see how the management I think is really too short. I would prefer.
Agent: That too we have, maybe we just need [TIME-4] or so we don't need long meaning to give you an idea of what our management is. [TIME-5] or two small, two few.
Speaker 5: I agree, I agree [PERSON-17]. I think we could organize a separation of,
Agent: On the supports as well.
Agent: Was that?
Agent: Yes, I can, I can take it offline with you. Just send me some options. And also who needs to be included in that session. And I can see the schedule for you with that right now. Yeah, no problem.
Speaker 6: Okay, is there anything else regarding the case and the customer that you prepared that you can share
Agent: Or was that mostly it [PERSON-10]?
Agent: Okay, well, we have a, I have a full deck with some more details, but I need to wait because it's been approved for an internal sharing.
Speaker 6: First for
Agent: Of course. Yeah, because unfortunately there are a lot of details, not a lot, but
Speaker 6: There are some details on the government. So the government needs to approve. Yeah, of course, we understand that.
Agent: So there's nothing else that you can share regarding that [DATE-17]. about this use case. I mean, I don't know, you have
Agent: Specific questions
Agent: In mind, because I know that the high level stories, they were starting from partially manual operations with a new company and that they have provided that are built in the artlet for them. They have customers.
Agent: And they sell to the customer, they are good producers by their partners, plus the services they provide internally. So they expertise.
Agent: The software services because they also sell like virtual servers, you know, and other elements to build electric distribution cabins and centrals and control the grid.
Agent: So this kind of hardware buildings are not just hardware, but obviously there are software services inside it.
Agent: It's not exactly a charger, it's a little bit more complex, but also if you think of a meter, Not the meter also can also be, I would say, augmented with some services.
Agent: So they combine together the supply chain of other with their services, they provide, and software and human services, and then they sell it through complex contracts to be to be companies [ORG-31], and distribution of adults.
Speaker 6: That are managed, like
Agent: In [GPE-4] and in the rest of [LOC-1] as you can see is like 17 different countries in the markets who... I don't know if you have specific questions, [PERSON-26], maybe I know something that I'm not mentioning, but
Speaker 6: This is the high level overview. Yeah, so I pasted the link of what is seems from their website, what seems to be a bit more aligned to what we are trying to do.
Speaker 6: And it's a combination of I guess they call it mirror as a service. So I imagine it includes the hardware and then also some software in regards to that.
Speaker 6: So I think if they are using sales force to manage that part, that is what would be interesting for us to learn from, because it is a bit more aligned. So that you need to check in
Agent: We understand, of course, with them on the next slide. I mean, I'm. They're not.
Agent: I know for sure that the part of the process that you see on this slide now, shall be made on the screen, so the full process of selling and fulfilling, this is done with sales, for sports, for this product, okay?
Agent: So the software, as I said, the software, they are included in the guide-all of management with sales, for [GPE-5] out. So that is, I can already say to you, yes, doing it wrong.
Speaker 6: They're
Agent: So maybe just to be conscious of time, we just have [TIME-6] left. I think [PERSON-1], what we can do is we can ask the internal team of the customer who implemented this.
Agent: If they are open for a call with you or reference call say share what they have implemented there.
Speaker 6: Or have
Agent: Specifically, on the last part with the metering as a service.
Speaker 6: You've mentioned with the
Agent: Let me just check that with the team and come back to you with that question when we can set up the meeting and how and who it is to be included in there.
Speaker 6: And
Agent: And then I think the second sectional item I have is that I will [PERSON-25] or [ORG-26] will mention the order of management piece so that we can schedule a [TIME-4] demo.
Agent: And I also just wanted to ask if everything is clear and it's Yeah, it's answered to your needs [PERSON-1] for the subscription. So when to you subscription management in [GPE-6].
Agent: What is currently available, what's available in order management and how everything <inaudible> up together. Maybe the last part is not clear, completely clear, but we can give a [TIME-7] demonstration around order.
Agent: Fulfillment facility, but I can understand that you are most interested in the first and maybe the last part so that's what we're doing.
Speaker 6: So let me know. Yeah, first of all, thank you for taking the time to meet with us and prepare for this and also walking us through all the information.
Speaker 6: I think it was useful and yeah, if we can have some additional details on how they worked with that part, it would be great.
Speaker 6: So maybe we can coordinate that as an next step and of course for [PERSON-9] to understand a little bit more about the order management part. Yeah, nothing else from my end.
Speaker 6: I don't know if anyone else from the [ORG-28] team wants to share other thoughts.
Speaker 5: Just it was very useful conversation. Thanks [PERSON-17] and Anuk for presentation. It increases quite a lot of understanding of salesforce products on my side.
Agent: Okay, thank you, not thank you to you and in general, I mean, for what it regards the detailed aspects of technical aspects of some elements and like, you know, my studio or typical or whatever.
Agent: Also, if you want to, if you have doubts about some of them, maybe you can also drop me an email and we can address them because obviously there are several aspects that we cannot address in a high level meeting like this.
Speaker 5: I'm a violin baller. Alright, alright, things in ill.
Agent: Thanks everyone.
Speaker 5: Have a great day.
Speaker 6: Have a great day. Thanks for the time. Bye bye.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information on the customer's specific concerns about the seller's product. The customer did ask several questions about the product's capabilities and features, but these do not necessarily indicate concerns. Additionally, the customer expressed interest in the product and its potential to meet their needs.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question about customer examples where it's a combination of software and hardware: The customer seemed more engaged as they were interested in understanding how subscriptions are managed in the context of both software and hardware elements, which is relevant to their own business model.
2. Question about exposing features and attributes of subscriptions via the Commerce API: The customer showed interest in this topic as they wanted to know how to make this information available to other systems, which is important for their consistent offering of subscription-based services.
3. Question about organizing a session with the team who delivered the project to the Grisper ties company: The customer was keen on learning more from the team that delivered the project, indicating that they found the Grisper ties use case relevant and informative.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of explaining the features and capabilities of the product, but there were a few instances where they could have better articulated the value proposition of the company or product. Here are some opportunities:

1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep thanked the customer for being there, but they did not explicitly mention the purpose of the call or the value that the customer would gain from the call.
2. The sales rep mentioned the acquisition of Velocity and the integration of their software, but they did not clearly explain how this acquisition and integration would benefit the customer.

7. The sales rep mentioned the new capabilities and applications provided by the company, but they did not clearly explain how these capabilities and applications would solve the customer's problems or meet their needs.

In general, the sales rep could have done a better job of connecting the features and capabilities of the product to the customer's pain points and needs. They could have also provided more concrete examples of how the product has helped similar customers in the past.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer to this question is unclear.

They did mention that they are using some of the seller's products and services, and they are interested in learning more about certain features and aspects. They also asked for a reference call with the internal team of a customer who implemented a similar solution to understand their experience. However, they did not make a clear statement about whether the product meets their needs overall.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. The questions were:
- ""So, during [DATE-2], we have, every, every year we have three releases. And the idea behind this is as face-forces in general is doing with the [PRODUCT-1] is to provide new capabilities, okay?""
- ""So if there is already a product or a sub product that is providing a functionality, says for us it's trying to say, OK, this is the solution. We will not build other solutions for the same aspect.""
- ""So say it's also in the latest, I think mostly in [DATE-3] . is trying to simplify and normalize the solution.""
- ""So if you have any general question on, on energy ground as a vertical, feel free to, to ask, I mean, me and [PERSON-3] will be glad to answer.""
- ""So, during [DATE-2], we have, every, every year we have three releases. And the idea behind this is as face-forces in general is doing with the [PRODUCT-1] is to provide new capabilities, okay?""
- ""So there has been an effort to start producing some already built applications for some use cases, like for use cases for call center agents or use cases for the customer acquisition through the digital portals, the self-service portals and so on and so on.""
- ""So [ORG-2] has produced some of these applications already done that you can [PERSON-4], welcome. And we would see some of them more in [DATE-4].""
- ""Then there is, as you, as [PERSON-1] was asking about, I saw first also a verticalization of field service. This means that the [ORG-2] horizontal solution for [ORG-3] has been increased with some new licenses and capabilities.""
- ""And as an example, you know, the most ingredients for [ORG-4] users, the contractors that are not using directly the [PRODUCT-1] to access also the extended data model.""
- ""Go to the next slide . that is happening in the latest period of some prepared work cycles and mobile flows for typical field work from technical agents that are working on the field and so on.""
- ""So there is a set of licenses for [ORG-3] that is verticalized to allow you to provide those other energy discoveries like using an omni-script or accessing the model and so on.""
- ""Another thing that is quite relevant, probably you already are, if you are using the vertical you should know it, is that from [EVENT-1], we also have a launch into the program for automatic upgrades.""
- ""So this means that if you onboard on this program, you will not need to upgrade the managed package yourself for every version. But [ORG-2] will take care of upgrading the package.""
- ""Then what else?""
- ""There are some other things like we will see in the next slide, but essentially, you know, the roadmap is progressing.""
- ""So one of them is to to go to code, okay, and this is really taking a lot of efforts from our engineers because I can't repeat what is.""
- ""Another model, all the APIs for the CPU as an example have been moved to code. Most of them are already moved.""
- ""What else?""
- ""The only studio, only studio, so the set of the like on-microcript cards and so on and so forth, is there is now a standard Code version that is just using Code objects. And it still exists the package version.""
- ""But obviously to adapt to energy ground to work completely with the core solution of our new studio, there has been and is still not finished [DATE-6].""
- ""I think [DATE-7], would be the final [ORG-5] of the solution and the fence. Because some of the technical aspects behind the velocity assets like the car for [ORG-6] or other aspects, they are not easy.""
- ""In the sense, they use namespaces, they use a lot of... Code behind it, so to adapt it to work with the [PERSON-5] s in the standard, it took like one year You should be done now We are just waiting""
- ""For a go from product management to say, let's say to the customer to [ORG-7] e to [PERSON-6] in the standard.net to you .""
- ""When you"
video_19791_167_6qr3y000000odqJAAQ,"Agent: And [PERSON-1], nice to meet you. I think you are the only new face.
EndUser: Yeah, nice to meet you as well.
Agent: I'm [PERSON-2]. I'm the Marketing Cloud account executive that works with [ORG-1]. So [DATE-1] we're going to turn it over to [PERSON-3]. He'll be going through Marketing Cloud engagement.
Agent: And [PERSON-4], really from the conversations we had previously focusing in on some of those new areas within [PRODUCT-1] that you all currently can take advantage of.
Agent: The real outcome of this is to get your feedback on does the new functionality that would be available in this world. Help make your decision as to a direction to move in.
Agent: Is there value there from the pieces that [PERSON-3] shows above and beyond what you have [DATE-1]. So I will speak for [PERSON-3], but I'm sure [PERSON-3] will say the same.
Agent: If there are questions, comments, thoughts as we go through, we'd love to hear that and make sure that we are on the right path with what we show.
Agent: And again, please put your questions in the chat, raise your hand, just come off mute. This is meant to walk you through what's possible. So if that sounds good to everybody, I'll turn it over to [PERSON-3].
Agent: Thanks [PERSON-5] and good afternoon everybody there in court law [ORG-2] or wherever you join us from [DATE-1] my name is [PERSON-6].
Agent: I'm a lead solution engineer in the Marketing Cloud and I am going to show you the modern sales force [PRODUCT-1] [DATE-1].
Agent: So like [PERSON-7] said, as you have questions of questions come up, feel free to interrupt me, pop them in the chat.
Agent: We probably have [TIME-1] Content to go through, so there should be plenty of time for questions. So if you have questions, throw them out.
Agent: First things first, what do you actually get with Marketing Cloud?
Agent: So everything I show you [DATE-1] is out of the box. It comes with [PRODUCT-2] that you would upgrade to.
Agent: If I show you anything that is not included out of the box, I will call that out right up front.
Agent: We will talk about and you'll see mostly email [DATE-1], but I will also mention mobile and I'll also mention web, since all of those things are important to you all.
Agent: There may be a tiny mention of some digital advertising.
Agent: When we get to journeys and journey building, we have not included any kind of digital advertising capabilities out of the box with Marketing Cloud but certainly that's something you can grow into and add if you would like.
Agent: Thanks for watching ! Everything else you see [DATE-1] comes with the new and modern marketing cloud. So with that, we'll jump right in.
Agent: If you have not visited or you haven't seen an updated marketing cloud, this is what it's looked like for [DATE-2] now. I'll call your attention to the studios on the left.
Agent: These are, you can think of these as kind of your vertical communication channels, right?
Agent: We'll spend most of our time [DATE-1] in email, but [PRODUCT-1] can handle communication on every channel. That can include SMS and MMS text messaging, and also pushes out to current and future digital applications. We do that.
Agent: Just through an SDK So you can put that in any app that you would like It doesn't have to be specific to [ORG-3] You can't control digital advertising I'll make mention of that, but again, not include d with what we've scoped out of the box for you all [ORG-4] is something that we may not talk about in depth I can show you how we would build landing pages and the like And there are some really, really cool capabilities particularly this thing called interactive emai l that leverages the power of [ORG-4] even though you don't really see it And then personalization is a real-time interaction management tool, not anything we're going to talk about [DATE-1], but reall y, really cool and it's on right.
Agent: So if you think of those vertical communication channel s, let's just call them web text and email, you manage those kind of separately and individual ly a day and that causes problems with efficiency because you have to repeat efforts and you' re trying to knit those things togethe r. And it's really hard to understand how all those things work.
Agent: Plus, it's not the most efficient use of time for people who are responsible for building those things. So on the right, one of the most important parts of Marketing Cloud are the builders.
Agent: We'll spend a lot of time talking about [WORK_OF_ART-1] [DATE-1]. You will see Content builder. We will talk about contact builder. The builders work across the studios.
Agent: So that's why we can create behavior triggered Messaging based on what you do on a website, what you do in an email, what you do with a text message.
Agent: So the magic of all of this is really [WORK_OF_ART-1]. That's the thing that would really revolutionize the way that you all think about what you do. without down communication efforts . So we'll go through all that stuff.
Agent: As part of the show, you will see lots of [PERSON-8]. So Salesforce Einstein is our [PRODUCT-3] platform. I will call out the different parts of AI that you may be seeing and what we're leveraging.
Agent: We will talk a little bit about some predictive and generative [PRODUCT-3] that's just right out of the box with what we do. So with that, that's the lay of the land. That's what we're going to talk about [DATE-1].
Agent: Before we get to the fun stuff of how to build emails, deal with content, and interact with recipients in a different way, I am going to talk about data a little bit because all of this is kind of underpinned by the data that you have in recruit.
Agent: How do we get that data into [PRODUCT-1] in more efficient way?
Agent: And how might you even use data at some point that isn't in recruit?
Agent: You may have data that is useful, that doesn't necessarily need to go into the [PRODUCT-4] that you could still leverage for communication. So that's the overall plan [DATE-1].
Agent: Any objections, questions, burning thoughts or requests before we hop into it. All righty, then first up, and I'll do my best to show you where we're going [DATE-1].
Agent: The first place we are going to go is inside of contact builders. We can talk a little bit about that. So this is kind of the heart of everything that Marketing Cloud does.
Agent: This is both a visual and actual representation of our data architecture in the system.
Agent: It is a contact centric data model, meaning that we assign a unique identifier to one person, so that whether there is data about you coming from multiple places, like recruit, or from other systems, we can rationalize who you are.
Agent: This contact centric hub is spoke data model is really central to what we do And this is the bulk of the work and effor t that Off-Print technology that you spoke with last wee k by implementation, they will help you set up these connection s because there are lots of ways to do thi s through the new and future APIs that [ORG-5] releases through Marketing Cloud APIs But [DATE-1], you can leverage things like automated SFTP dropoff s to do those integrations There are lots of integration methods available The thing that I want you to understand her e is that any piece of data that [ORG-1] ha s, you can connect to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud data mode l. Yes, the majority of that data tod ay lives and recruit.
Agent: But if that changes in the future, if there are new efforts in the future, or if you just want to expand what you're doing, because there's a lot of efficiency that we'll find in [PRODUCT-1] now, you can do that pretty easily, and you can spin up these hubs and spokes as needed.
Agent: So if in the future, there's a different [ORG-6] or a different financial aid system, or just some really important VIP recruiting spreadsheet that you get from somewhere that needs to be related into the system so you can use it.
Agent: There is a way to do that. That's what the data designer, what [PRODUCT-1] data is about. We'll use the term the way [PRODUCT-1] rationalizes data is with data extensions.
Agent: Data extensions are just a data table inside of the marketing cloud. So each one of these data connections can have multiple data extensions, any data that you add to the marketing cloud.
Agent: We'll relate back to a contact ID to a subscriber key so that we know that [PERSON-4] at [ORG-7] and [PERSON-4] at [ORG-8] are the same person.
Agent: And you can even start to do things like understand multiple mobile addresses and that stuff.
Agent: So questions about data or any of that stuff with the understanding that a huge portion of the work for data design and making this happen is what [PERSON-9] from [ORG-9] discussed with you [DATE-3].
Agent: So once we have the data, we can do fun things with it.
Agent: Any questions about this?
Agent: And like I said, we can be as technical here as anybody wants to be. But I want to make sure you understand where all of the magic tidbits come from that you're that we're about to use. All right.
Agent: Hub and spoke data model, very important. If you have the data, you can connect it to that contact hub and use it to do fun stuff.
Agent: So one of the first things that you might want to do is some segmentation or suppression. Here I am inside of email studio, excuse me, email studio and I am creating a data filter.
Agent: So data filters exist all over the Marketing Cloud and this is how you as a communications user, as an admissions user, are going to start manipulating data.
Agent: Here I am looking for a segment, so I want to create a segment where somebody has an incomplete application, so maybe they've started and they haven't completed, and their first time freshmen.
Agent: So this data is available to me and all of these data fields that you see here are available to me because they were connected through the hub and spoke model.
Agent: When that data is connected to the hub, you can do the following things. So maybe you want to create a special campaign that's focusing only on out-of-state students.
Agent: So we wanna look for a state not equal to [GPE-1] and we can do as many nested and ors as we want here.
Agent: So if we wanted this to be and this to be or, or if you wanna create really interesting program specific, defined specific degree programs, degree tracks, If you're looking for only women from a certain zip code that you want to target with some sort of outreach, you can do that.
Agent: The idea is that any piece of data that you have, you can define drag and drop.
Agent: You don't need any kind of... Any kind of special data skills, you don't need any kind of understanding of SQL to start creating the sort of segment that you want.
Agent: Behind the scenes, what this is doing is actually writing a SQL statement that we query the data with. You don't need to know anything about that.
Agent: This opens up a new world of being able to manipulate your data, right?
Agent: You don't have to ask someone who understands your database, you don't have to ask someone to combine data for you. Whoever is creating a [PRODUCT-5] target, creating a list, whatever that is, you can do it on your own.
Agent: So this, I hope this sounds more fun than it looks because this is kind of the least <inaudible> thing in terms of what it looks like in marketing cloud, but it's probably the most powerful because this opens up literally any piece of data with roles and permissions to anyone who needs to use it in their context.
Agent: So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5].
Agent: Questions about that?
Agent: The data filters will show up everywhere. We'll see them again in [PRODUCT-5] targeting.
Agent: You can save these and reuse them, which means someone, maybe someone in admissions is responsible for creating all the data filters, and then someone who's responsible for creating [PRODUCT-5] only applies the data filters.
Agent: So all of that's a possibility, but this is how you interact with your data in marketing club. So once we have a... question. Sorry. This might be maybe more of an offline question for [PERSON-10] afterwards.
EndUser: But like as and when our data goes in, I'm curious how the fields will come through from the different entities, like opportunity person, you know, the application entity, like all those things, how they'll show up on that side, or maybe [PERSON-3], you know, if you brought over recruit users?
Agent: So I can give my answer for I've seen other users do this. Obviously the world's your oyster and you guys will set it up however you would like.
Agent: Inside of the connections that you make to different source systems, you'll actually do basically create a crosswalk so that you can say this is opportunity data and it maps to this field.
Agent: This is lead data and it maps to this field. That sort of granularity for all of the fields that you want to map is up to you in the data creation process.
Agent: I don't know how that works for you all today, but again, that is part of the work so that whatever data structures that you have and recruit that you may want to maintain in marketing cloud, you'd simply set up the model to work that way.
Agent: The field in [PRODUCT-1] knows that it's equivalent to this field. in your source system like recruit. We have that set up already. We have that set up already.
Agent: Is that going to be different?
Agent: Doesn't have to be. No. So I think the difference would be is.
Agent: Is there data that you can't get at now that you want to leverage with [PRODUCT-1] or for future development purposes when ethos is a reality for you all?
Agent: Are there things that you maybe want to update on a different cadence?
Agent: So things that come in maybe more frequently than the daily, you know, [DATE-6] drop off kind of pulls. You wouldn't have to change any of that. You could replicate it.
Agent: I would encourage you to think about not only replicating because there is a lot of new capability here, but certainly you can do that to start as a pretty low lift.
EndUser: Yeah, I feel like, again, we could do this offline, but the participant data is not always, or participant polls are not always really easy to get all the data we need mat correctly, but we can move on. Yeah.
Agent: Just for clarity, in the beginning, your hub and spoke may just have one spoke, right?
Agent: It's just contact data just coming from one data feed and recruit. The point here.
Agent: Is that you can grow that data ecosystem, right?
Agent: It doesn't always have to be just a single connection.
Agent: There may be things that you want to pull directly from forms, directly from websites, maybe directly from things like [ORG-10]. We'll talk about that in a bit.
Agent: The only thing back to that hub and spoke model, just to call out, because I think we've mentioned it, is the business unit architecture option would be new to what they would have available.
Agent: I don't know how much it applies in this initial part of a consideration, but no one that we're representing undergrad and grad, and I know there's been about how financial aid fits into some communication models that exist.
Agent: Can you just give like the 33nd of what this could potentially mean?
Agent: Yeah, so business units in the Marketing Cloud are essentially shared infrastructure, right?
Agent: I'm in the prestigious [ORG-9]. You can have as many layers of business units as you would like.
Agent: For example, I've created one for our online, our online college where, subunits all report up to the same unit, meaning that [ORG-1] can know everything that sent to everyone, but maybe in enrollment, I only have access to the data and [PRODUCT-5] that I need to do what I do.
Agent: So in that way, if there ever needs to be any kind of bifurcation in data or responsibilities for who creates what and shares what, that capability exists, and then users within those units and administrators of the top unit decide who gets to see what.
Agent: So.
Agent: That is a great capability to have if there's ever a need for people to share data at a high level, but also to protect certain data or content, or if branding's really different, right?
Agent: The way that you talk about graduate degrees may be really different than the way that you talk about undergraduate degrees, so we create [PRODUCT-5] in a different place. But that possibility exists. All right.
Agent: That's all of the unfun data related stuff. Data comes into marketing cloud, let's do something with it. So I am inside email studio here and I am starting just with a template.
Agent: So I am very fond of saying that templates and dynamic [PRODUCT-5] will set you free. I've created just from stolen items on your website, created a template here for you.
Agent: I'll point out that we offer responsive design templates out of the box so you can design in a mobile emulator view. I'm showing you in desktop here just because it fits on my screen a little better.
Agent: And as a template creator, you can choose who can change things with the template. So perhaps you are very, very sensitive to making sure that exactly the right size color lines, low those, that's what a stuff gets enforced.
Agent: An administrator can block areas of the template so that no one will ever be able to change things like the header and footer, right?
Agent: So that a [PRODUCT-5] creator only has to focus on content. You will only have access to do things that have those roles and permissions in the system. Everything that happens in [PRODUCT-5] is drag and drop.
Agent: So I will show you what I mean by that, but it's basically if you want an image, you are going to drag and drop and define that image.
Agent: I started building some Content for you, just some basic stuff that again, I borrowed from your website so we can talk about how this works. You can also do this with layouts.
Agent: So I've chosen basically a hero image, some text and a call to action button. You don't have to know anything about HTML. It'll make this stuff work.
Agent: You choose and drag and drop your layouts to decide what you want.
Agent: If now we're in the future, you or web designers want to leverage things that are already built in HTML, everything in [PRODUCT-1] will render and display HTML, CSS and [GPE-2]. Yes, it's [PERSON-9], [PERSON-1], sorry.
EndUser: I was just going to say, we kind of already know how to do this. We do this already. So this is kind of like stuff that is new to us.
EndUser: I don't know if maybe you want to like try kind of something else because I mean, [PERSON-9], if you're okay with that. I mean, I'm already used to doing it like this already. I know you are too. Okay.
EndUser: So.
Agent: Sure. Um, you guys do dynamic Content [DATE-1]. So you're familiar with dynamic content, setting filters, um, that sort of stuff. Yes. This looks familiar to you. Perfect. So all of that stuff already exists.
Agent: The things that you don't do [DATE-1] may be some things like advanced [PRODUCT-5] design. So stuff like interactive email.
Agent: So interactive email is essentially a way to embed a web form into email so that you lower the friction required to get information from someone and just make it a lot easier to collect.
Agent: So here's what that would look like. So by dragging an interactive form block into the email and a built one for you here, you can do stuff like this.
Agent: Maybe you just want to collect some preference information as part of an email send, right?
Agent: So I need to know, hey, what might help you decide to enroll?
Agent: How seriously are you thinking about this?
Agent: Is there other stuff that you want to know?
Agent: All of this is just captured as a data extension and [PRODUCT-1] that can further your automation.
Agent: So knowing this information could help you focus on, hey look, we want the kind of warm, but I'm not sure I'm coming yet. And the people who say, yeah, you're definitely my number one choice.
Agent: I'm going to segment you differently. This costs very little effort to set up and you can see huge increases in engagement of the cause of it.
Agent: We've had customers who have seen not [PERCENT-1] but 10x greater engagement with email by doing things like this. The an interesting point about this is you can also pass hidden fields.
Agent: So you could make this a progressive form. So if you wanted new fields to show up, you don't want to show someone five different things, they have to answer every time.
Agent: Maybe in every outreach, you're updating one or two components to get more information. Yep, go ahead.
EndUser: So with this too, if we do have like it be so interactive where they're putting in like different types of information, like even like first name, last name or whatever, even though we already have that.
Agent: Can that actually just go back and connect into recruit them, you think?
Agent: Is that a possibility?
Agent: We can send back into an opportunity record and all that. It can. So that exists. I do want to say that Marketing Cloud doesn't magically make that happen.
Agent: It's dependent upon your integration method, right?
Agent: So absolutely, that's a possibility. The data can be stored in Marketing Cloud for a point, and then maybe once a week or [DATE-7], you do that poll now.
Agent: The possibility exists, certainly on [PRODUCT-1] side for this to be real-time.
Agent: I know there's discussion about what that would look like for you long-term in [ORG-1] as you guys adopt more of a recruit and ethos API philosophy versus those manual drop-offs. But yeah, absolutely.
Agent: The possibility exists for any data collected [PRODUCT-1] to be sent back to another system.
Agent: How you get that data from [PRODUCT-1] is kind of incumbent upon your setup and upon the system that you would send it to.
EndUser: Yeah, we could probably do the same thing with the SFTP, right?
EndUser: Or just put it into a folder and then it gets, oh, okay. So there we could do that.
EndUser: But with this form too, like how interactive can we get?
EndUser: Can we do like drop down menus to between like
Agent: Yeah, so let's I've got a few different. Let me get rid of this guy here. I've got a few different types of Content here. So let me hop into a preview and show you what it looks like.
Agent: So when I go to preview and test this particular form, this is what the experience would look like. I'll do it in mobile since pretty much everybody's gonna be doing a mobile. This is a multi-select.
Agent: So you know what, I'm having trouble with FAFSA and I wanna see what the campus looks like. I'm warm, but I don't know. This is pre-response. This is checkbox. So that's kind of what the experience looks like.
Agent: We'll go back. I'll show you another one that I've seen a lot of customers use very successfully. Since you all do have a student ambassador program, you could set up a way to do interactive ask a student.
Agent: So this one would have drop-downs. When you create those, [PERSON-1], it's pretty easy. These are the options you have for text, select, radio, checkbox, images, star ratings, that kind of stuff.
Agent: So that's all very much kind of click and configure. And let me show you what that looks like so far as the experience. But yes, you can do drop downs. That's my long way of saying.
Agent: Yeah, you can drop downs multi-select.
EndUser: [PERSON-9], you might have already been doing this.
EndUser: I was just thinking for us to, we ever send out to like a spec list, you know, for people and they want to take what major they're in, we can change that drop down to math, which then recruits.
EndUser: They're going to have to go to another website. It is right there on the email and send it in. You probably already are doing that, but I was just.
EndUser: Yeah, no, we actually haven't been doing that. And we've been talking about using suspects, but we aren't currently, but all good things.
EndUser: I could think of 10 ways to use this right off the top. We do.
EndUser: Ok. And that's exactly the point, right?
Agent: You can collect this on a web form and I'm not saying that this should replace any kind of web form strategy that you have.
Agent: What this can do is supplement that communication in a very real way, right?
Agent: The reason that we have customers see that big increase in engagement is it costs me a lot less clicks to do this from an email.
Agent: I'm already looking at them, open it up in the browser and maybe having to scroll. You know, those little things that reduce friction matter.
Agent: So that's, you know, this starts to answer some of what I believe [PERSON-9] was talking about. with like capturing demonstrated interest throughout the process. Right.
Agent: Is that what we were thinking of here too for interactive email?
Agent: I
Agent: Think so. It could. No, that question is not for me.
Agent: But yeah, the idea is In every send, if you wanted, you can create a way for that recipient on the other end to give you information, right?
Agent: A direct way to offer up zero-party information that you can use for further segmentation suppression, whatever you would like.
Agent: All right, a couple of things that I do want to show you that are kind of new to marketing clients [DATE-1]. Maybe right now, you wouldn't know how to start thinking about all of these new segments you create.
Agent: So using something like interactive email, some of you have a lot more data, so you can do a lot more refined targeting. We do offer some generative [PRODUCT-3] out of the box.
Agent: So here I'll show you what that looks like in terms of subject lines. So what we're doing here, this is leveraging a secure [WORK_OF_ART-2].
Agent: So all of the trust and security of the [ORG-3] comes here. Now [PERSON-14]...
Agent: I'm just going to do what I would do with chat [ORG-9], right?
Agent: So the key message is I want you to apply [DATE-1]. and we want you here, whatever it is that you want in that subject line.
Agent: I've created a brand personality where I gave it some parameters and here's the prompt that you should use.
Agent: You have to click the box that says you understand robots particularly over the world if you don't use this with correct ethics and business protocol and it'll create some draft subject lines for you.
Agent: So look, maybe these aren't perfect. Yeah, that one looks okay, that one doesn't. What is awesome about this is you start training . [ORG-1] starts training its own [WORK_OF_ART-3] inside of marketing cloud.
Agent: So the more you use it, the smarter it gets, the more effective it becomes.
Agent: So this is not going to replace what a marketer does, but it probably changes the way you think about spending your time, right?
Agent: You can pick out a few subject lines that, you know, look good so you can start thinking about other things.
Agent: The exact same thing exists When you are creating text and body copy, if you want to take it to that degree, you'll be able to create even generative body copy if that's something that you want to do.
Agent: And again, since you can create brand personalities that you control and prompt, you can try and control what the output of that generative [PRODUCT-3] is so that it sounds like the same kind of brand identity and voice you have when your marketing is writing.
Agent: So, just another way to start expanding out and using. using some of the [PRODUCT-3] availability. One last thing, you all do any A, B testing with what you're doing [DATE-1] in email.
Agent: So there are a couple of ways to think about A, B testing. You can do it right inside.
Agent: So you'll see this [PRODUCT-5] block, an A, B test Content block, where you literally just define A, define B, and see who wins.
Agent: I built one for you just to give you an idea of what it would look like. If you do it one block at a time, you are literally going to do it one block at a time.
Agent: Is it the carrying shark or the disruptor shark that gets more clicks?
Agent: A really easy thing to do. This doesn't have to be images. It can be any combination of things. Code snippets, images, buttons, any of those sorts of things you could do as an AV test.
Agent: If you are looking to do multivariate A-B testing, that's what this entire A-B testing menu is about so that you can change what the from name is, what the subject line is, everything in the body.
Agent: So if you're looking to do multivariate testing, that's built in. If you just want to do quick head to heads and see what happens, that's what the A-B testing Content box is about. All right.
Agent: I know you guys have this today, but just so we don't lose it.
Agent: Anytime you see the silhouette inside of marketing cloud, this guy, so whether it's that's in subject lines, templates, anywhere else, any piece of data that you have, again, connected through that hub and spoke data model you do, you can use to do your replace stream kind of stuff.
Agent: So that's a quick run through of content, questions about that. Anything that you want to do, that you didn't see, anything you're curious about.
EndUser: Well, actually I got one funny question for you.
EndUser: So with that little guy that you just showed us, what'd you call him again?
EndUser: Oh, so the care.
Agent: No, yeah, the little degree, pick out all the data source, like the silhouette for a person. Yeah, just so this is just our replace string menu. Yep.
EndUser: Yeah. So that silhouette, let me ask you a question.
EndUser: How do you delete one of those off of that as an option?
EndUser: Like say that you go in there and you choose a data source. And yep, a data extension or data source and you put it in there and you want to get rid of it.
EndUser: How do you get rid of it?
EndUser: Because I went through you guys as customer service after I put one on there and I could not get rid of it for the life of me.
EndUser: I found a way to do it by deleting the old data source, but it was like a big pain and not even customer service could help me.
Agent: So if I do like a first name, I just want to do a first name personalization in the subject line.
Agent: You're asking how would I get rid of this?
Agent: No, as an option out of the silhouette. Oh, so you can't even see it. Yeah. Got it. So that is if you do not restrict a data extension that comes in.
Agent: So if you've got everything from recruit, that's available to everyone, then you would be able to pick everyone. What they're pick every data field.
Agent: What we see most customers do, especially if they're going to be occasional users that are building content, is use something called a filtered data extension, where you're taking just some of those components, right?
Agent: So maybe instead of every single field in the world, we just want there to be like 10 so that a [PRODUCT-5] builder can do some personalization without, you know, blowing up the world. So you could absolutely restrict that.
Agent: The short answer would be [PERSON-1] that you are doing that as a separate data extension or as a filtered view of an existing data extension .
Agent: And then you would restrict by user, you would restrict by user role who has access to what.
Agent: But yeah, I think they're, I'm sorry, that experience happened to you, but someone should have been able to express press two Hey, look, if you delete it from the data extension, it's gone from the data extension forever.
Agent: So why not just create a data extension that has those things that you want?
Agent: Yeah, I figured it out. I just wanted to see what you had in terms of suggestions. Yeah. Yeah. So templates, dynamic content, [ORG-9] testing, interactive email, which I can't overstate the importance of that.
Agent: It's all about making things a little bit easier for folks. Any kind of Content you want to create, we make it pretty easy. And again, copy and paste that stuff from HTML into this.
Agent: You can do it either or as well. You don't have to choose all Content blocks or all HTML. You can go back and forth between those things.
Agent: Anything else about Content before we move on?
Agent: So the whole point of this is to do this. This is the fun part. This is [WORK_OF_ART-1]. This is [WORK_OF_ART-1].
Agent: And this is the point of [PRODUCT-1] so that we can take any piece of data and automate Messaging on any channel. I'm just doing this as a basic email send right now.
Agent: So right now, if you're in my data extension and you have an email address, I'm gonna send you this email.
Agent: So maybe this is coming from an [ORG-14] form, right?
Agent: Anybody who clicks on the [ORG-14], this is the journey that you go on. where I'm going to send you some communication, I'm going to control the flow of that communication, maybe I send you some follow-up, and that's it.
Agent: So this is a short journey. So maybe to try and get some more engagement, you decide to use some tools in Marketing Cloud like predictive AI.
Agent: So predictive send time optimization looks at all the clicks and data that we have about you.
Agent: And based on the time period that you define, it's going to put it at the top of your inbox at the time that you're most likely to read it.
Agent: So I know [PERSON-7]'s up at [TIME-2] on [DATE-8], so that's when I'm going to send it to her in [DATE-9]. I know that [PERSON-17] reads things late on [DATE-10].
Agent: That's when I put it in her inbox. The idea being that it's the small things that you can do . to try and increase the likelihood that people are going to engage with your message.
Agent: Small thing, really easy to do, and it costs you a couple of clicks to set it up.
Agent: If you decide you're one two design something completely different, there is version control in [WORK_OF_ART-1], so you can always roll back to an earlier version if you don't like what you're working on.
Agent: But here I built more of a multi-channel journey where I'm going to look at behavior.
Agent: So in addition to sending that email, after [DATE-9], I want to know, did you click?
Agent: Did you actually click on the call to action?
Agent: Did you click on the Completely Enrollment button?
Agent: If you did, maybe I want to look for something else. I want to look for a data flag and recruit that says... Thanks for watching .
Agent: Application Complete, Deposit Paid, whatever that is, and based on the individual information about whether I clicked or not it chooses the path that I go down. If I did click Great, then I take the follow through steps. Great.
Agent: If I did click, but for some reason I didn't take that next step, clearly I'm someone who will engage with email, so let's send another email.
Agent: If I never clicked in the first place, maybe email is not it for me. I'm not paying attention to emails that come from you.
Agent: And instead, we're going to drop in a text message and send you that call to action via text. Then we can run the same logic.
Agent: Did you do the thing that we wanted you to do?
Agent: If so, great. We're just going to join you Backup to the top journey here and finish your enrollment. If not, that's when you can decide to do other things.
Agent: One of those things could be a very targeted paid digital ad audience. So you're going to include that individual in a very tight, low volume target ad buy to try and get them to convert.
Agent: Maybe if that doesn't work, maybe then and only then do we want to pay for postage and glossy mailers to go out to someone.
Agent: So based on whether you engage or not, what actions you take or not, you can control with automation and journey builder what happens next.
Agent: So this is the big idea and all of us as All of us as savvy digital consumers, we do this all the time, right?
Agent: [EVENT-1] was [DATE-9]. If you've ever gone to a website, put a thing in your cart and then intentionally not checked out because you know you're going to get a coupon in [DATE-9].
Agent: You know you're going to get a text rebate offer or that thing starts following you around on [ORG-17], [ORG-22], whatever. This is the kind of tool that controls that experience.
Agent: The idea is to knit together your communication channels, knit together all those pieces of data you have, honor the response.
Agent: That you get from people to drive the next step, all without someone having to go in pull a list, put it in somewhere else, and do that activation .
Agent: The kind of efficiency that you get from this process is hard. It's hard to comprehend when you're in a world now where what you do is recruit communication plans.
Agent: So the idea here is all the stuff that you would do or want to do more than what a communication plan would handle. This is the answer for how you would do that.
Agent: So we can talk more about all the different things available in [FAC-1] building but questions about this general idea.
EndUser: So I love this. This is the kind of stuff that I geek out over.
EndUser: How would this information look like coming back into recruit?
EndUser: Like... I'm trying to envision what it would look like because I can see the person record and the activities and the emails that they're receiving, although for us, texts aren't on there and things like that.
EndUser: But I'm just curious how this would feedback into recruit.
Agent: Yep. So again, I can tell you what the possibilities are from the Marketing Cloud side, then it would be up to you as to decisions what you feedback into recruit.
Agent: All of the things that I will call engagement data. So clicks, form fills, that sort of stuff. That's all information that's just part of a contact record, part of that contact ID and marketing cloud.
Agent: If there are parts of that you want to send back to their recruit record, great.
Agent: One of the most common things that we see is customers creating, by the way, what happens behind the scenes here?
Agent: You're just going to create, there's just going to, there is a data table that is created automatically in marketing cloud. so that you can do something with it down the road.
Agent: One of those things that you may want to do and what we see customers do most often in recruiting is create like [DATE-14] or [DATE-17] look back so that someone on a contact record can see, these are all the times that [PERSON-22] clicked in [DATE-22].
Agent: We may not want to see a full text and full message of everything ever sent.
Agent: You could do that, you know, it's debatable, the value of that, but any piece of data that [PRODUCT-1] collects, is there so that it can be sent to other places.
Agent: Again, I don't want to represent that is an automatic magic button that just happens. But to answer your question, [PERSON-4], each of these steps is just creating a data table.
Agent: You could direct that data table potentially to any place or any field dependent upon that receiving system. One of the most common things that we see recruit customers do right out of the box is these exits to journeys.
Agent: So let's say you got somebody who does all the things that you want them to do, the exit to a journey could be the beginning of another journey, right?
Agent: So everybody that gets through this gauntlet, that is simply creating a data extension, a list of people that were then going to put on our enrollment nurturing journey or start your advising journey, right?
Agent: So at the most basic level, every one of these steps is simply creating a data table. You can choose to send that data anywhere you would like or leverage it in other places in [PERSON-9].
Agent: Certainly one of the things we do in [ORG-3] [PRODUCT-4] is send that stuff back to contact records and leads and that sort of thing.
Agent: You would need to make sure that is possible and doable with your setup in recruit. Things like creating a task for recruiter in recruit. Short of that, you can also do things like send an email notification.
Agent: We see customers as a work around before you get that real-time integration with recruit. I'm doing things like that to send a recruiter in the morning Hey, here were your most active people [DATE-9].
Agent: These might be the ones that you want to reach out to [DATE-1].
EndUser: Do you have other institutions or another, maybe, user that is a recruit, a [NORP-1] user that is currently using [WORK_OF_ART-1], anyone that might be interested in chatting with us, that could show us real time, kind of how they do it?
Agent: I know those customers exist, but because [ORG-3] doesn't build that, you will need to work with off-prem to talk with those folks or other partners who have done it since we're not doing that work unless you know of someone [PERSON-7].
Agent: But generally, we refer folks to the partners who build that integration. Yeah, I was going to say [PERSON-9], we can, I know [PERSON-9] is going to do the demo, but he's in flight.
Agent: I'll connect with him and see who he can recommend that they've worked on to talk with you all that works. That'd be great. Thank you.
Agent: So the short story here is any way you want to control the flow of communications or information. You do it with flow control.
Agent: If you want to wait based on whether someone has clicked, based on some specific date, you know, this whole when I click when I engage, it's great for people who engage, but there are deadlines and admissions.
Agent: So maybe you wait until a specific date and it's [DATE-21] before an enrollment deadline so the push goes to everyone. There are ways to control this.
Agent: One other thing that I'll point out here is that [PERSON-8] exists in lots of ways out of the box in [PRODUCT-1]. One of the most useful ones can be with an Einstein engagement scoring split.
Agent: [PERSON-8] engagement scoring is a predictive [PRODUCT-3] score, 0 to 90.
Agent: How likely are you to click?
Agent: How likely are you to convert?
Agent: So you could do things like start segmenting folks based on what their engagement score is. So again, all of this is set up behind the scenes.
Agent: People who are more likely, most likely to click, we're going to send different [PRODUCT-5] to those people.
Agent: And of course, we want to do that based on click likelihood, not open likelihood, and let [PERSON-8] create those segments for you. So you can use [PRODUCT-3] to start getting more segment awareness than potentially you have [DATE-1].
Agent: Or then you have people to do the analysis for. That's the idea of how you could use predictive analysis. In addition to [PERSON-21] and Engagement Scoring, we also do a frequency score.
Agent: So this, I call this the Goldilocks score, right?
Agent: So based on somebody's engagement pattern, are they getting too much, not enough, or is it just right?
Agent: And you can start to split people out using [PRODUCT-3] in that way. The idea here is that it's there. It costs a couple of clicks to put it in and see how it works. most of our customers .
Agent: Put [ORG-9] in front of every send because it isn't no way harmful and can, you know, you can see incremental upticks and engagement because of that.
Agent: So that's journey building. I want to talk a little bit about reporting before we leave journey questions.
Agent: The only thing that I'd dinnell and [PERSON-25], when specifically, you know, the two, between three of us, we've talked a lot about like the email volume and quantity and how like emails are just going on.
Agent: Everybody, I think like we've talked about a journey builder and knowing that someone has taken an action and not sending them necessarily that an email that they don't need, right?
Agent: I think should help. start to cut down some of the extra volume that's perhaps happening because of the way sending is happening [DATE-1].
Agent: So just curious to have questions about that and just wanted to point that out because I know that a hot topic and I think that [WORK_OF_ART-1] will help to make sure those people are out automatically.
Agent: They're getting the next message they need as they need it. That sort of thing.
EndUser: I agree. I'm a little too.
Agent: So, I mean, this is just my point of view.
Agent: If people aren't engaging with your email and they've got a long history of not engaging with your email, pounding them over the face with more email may not be the best approach.
Agent: Sure, you may get someone who randomly clicks after [DATE-25] when they have it after all that time. But there's potentially a lot less sending that can be cut out to people who aren't engaging with it.
Agent: Having the ability to analyze that engagement matters. You can do that with journeyability. You can do that with some reports. So let's talk about reporting real quickly.
Agent: You may already be familiar with this level of sin tracking inside of marketing cloud. This is just single sin tracking. How many clicks, how many bounces, hard or soft, that kind of stuff.
Agent: You want to get kind of your click activity, heat map, which links, which areas where people using, that something exists in the Marketing Cloud here as well.
Agent: I do want to show you a tool that I'm not sure you're using [DATE-1] out of the box called intelligence reports. So, intelligence reports in the Marketing Cloud are pre-configured dashboards leveraging our broader [PRODUCT-1] intelligence platform.
Agent: And again, this is out of the box to help you do quick analysis of big data.
Agent: So, if you want to look for certain sending dates, certain campaigns, and analyze what engagement looked like, what does the pattern look like daily for all of these metrics.
Agent: If I want to look at only one or two things, that is a really easy thing to manipulate. These dashboards are real time. Parts and pieces of these dashboards can be scheduled.
Agent: So the sharing guy right here can be great. You could set up a scheduled report to go out every [DATE-22] at 4.634038513414288 to deans or whomever that may want to know what's happening.
Agent: This can save you a lot of time and keep people up to date with what's going on. They don't have to log in the Marketing Cloud to see it.
Agent: You can just have it sent as a PDF or an image sent out via email. So, parts or pieces of a dashboard are really easy to automate in that way.
Agent: Lots of cool things you can do around understanding what your deliverability looks like.
Agent: Here, I'm just going to look at unsubscribe rates to find out, do I have problems with certain email domains?
Agent: Are there [DATE-25] or sending patterns where I can do things to, you know, reduce what my undeliverables look like?
Agent: So ways to manage that sort of deliverability hygiene. And then if you want to start doing some broad audience analysis, we make that really easy too.
Agent: So for whatever reason, this registration incomplete audience, our click rate is way higher.
Agent: Why is that?
Agent: Or our unsubscribes or hire for this audience?
Agent: It's a way to start looking at big data in a way that you can make some decisions about all of the data behind all of these dashboards you can pivot on.
Agent: So if you want to get that in the pivot and start drilling down, you absolutely can do it. One of the other things that we include with intelligence reports is cross channel apps.
Agent: So this would be a paid edition if you want it. It is not a wildly expensive thing, but there are four cross-channel apps, including one that works with [ORG-10].
Agent: I'll show you what that looks like for email-to-web conversion. And all of this works simply through single sign-on to your [ORG-21] account. So I saw the [ORG-21] tracking links you all have updated to GA4 for web tracking.
Agent: What you do here is basically single sign-on to that. GA4 account, it's going to pull in all of your [ORG-21] web tags and properties, mix that with your [PRODUCT-1] data so you can see things like this funnel.
Agent: Based on emails sent, how many visits did that get us?
Agent: How many applications did that get us?
Agent: If you want to do things like traffic analysis from web and email, you can start to see what that looks like and start drilling into some insights.
Agent: If you want to see what performance looks like between email and web. The idea here.
Agent: Here is we, [ORG-3] know that pretty much the entire world uses [ORG-10] So we're offering a pretty easy way to start [PERSON-22] those two things, to do some analysis that you may no t have time or bandwidth to do [DATE-1] .
Agent: Right?
Agent: So if we want to look at what is our, you know, what is our very best visitor bounce rate and what is that telling us about which days that happened, which campaigns are producing that?
Agent: It's a pre-configured dashboard. You don't have to have a data analyst or someone who suddenly has [TIME-3] in a day to go and figure this stuff out. So short answer with intelligence and reporting.
Agent: Is that any kind of reporting you want to do is available in the marketing cloud, whether that's individual, kind of, send-level reports, subscriber-level reporting, or this kind of broader analysis of what's going on across all of your sending that is interactive and most importantly can be scheduled and shared across the department across the university.
Agent: Questions about reporting?
Agent: Or any other kinds of reporting that I think to Recover the ones that I take notes on, we had taken notes on from our last conversation, but any other metrics that you're just curious about?
EndUser: I'm not thinking metrics, but I'm thinking about you know, calendaring and sending that out. I think about an email that [PERSON-4] sends every [DATE-25] of like, here's what's upcoming for our, like, here's the communications that are going out.
EndUser: Now that may be different now if we incorporate your new builder because those, some of those triggered communications, but some of those date specific communications that we want our team to know and be aware of as their students get in.
EndUser: So, can that be automatically sent for [PERSON-4]'s sake?
Agent: There is a communications calendar inside the marketing cloud.
Agent: It may not do all of the things you want it to do, but certainly you can create so that anybody inside of the business unit could see that, you know, we have a campaign launching [DATE-1].
Agent: These are [DATE-4] they are going to be events and messages. That is absolutely possible to do. You could set up some automation so that those things get added to the calendar.
Agent: If you don't have something like this today, and by the way, the way that I see most modern admissions departments who aren't making broad use of marketing cloud, the way that I see most of them doing it [DATE-1], it's kind of whiteboards and sticky notes.
Agent: So if you're doing it that way, you're not the only people who do it that way, but there is a way to create it digitally and share.
Agent: A couple of things that don't happen here, this calendar doesn't export to anywhere.
EndUser: So if you want to use this calendar, you need to be in Marketing Cloud and be able to see it. But there is a calendar kind of out of the box how you use it is up to you.
EndUser: So there is a way for the left hand and the right hand to know what's going on, [PERSON-25]. But date specific campaigns don't auto-populate on the calendar. You have to add it or do they.
Agent: So you could add a campaign here or let me show you where I, my screens or a little out of the sink here.
Agent: For example, when you go to create an email or a message, you could add, you could identify a campaign that already exists on your calendar.
Agent: So if I wanted to include this message as part of our, you know, push to apply for fall, that campaign will show up as a thin over in the campaign calendar.
Agent: You have to have that campaign set up and configured, or you manually add it in the calendar. So if you tag it here with a campaign that you've already set up, yes, it will appear in the calendar.
Agent: If you haven't done that and you just have a one-off send or an event or something, you would manually add that to the calendar. Yeah, so better, better, but not perfect is the way.
Agent: Just grab the Marketing Cloud calendar.
EndUser: Does this Marketing Cloud calendar by chance?
EndUser: I mean, like I'm sure it does, but can it think back into outlook for like if we were to have like a calendar we share between like a department now?
Agent: No. So that's one of those things I mentioned. If you want to use this calendar, you have to be in marketing cloud.
Agent: Another thing that I see a lot of admissions departments do to you guys, you know, Outlook users just create a shared calendar. Whoever the person is that creates things in the marketing calendar, you would create that
EndUser: Same campaign and your Outlook shared calendar so that people have a way to use it. I get it, it's manual, but that's, you know, that's, that's the way we see people do. Yeah, it's not the best feature.
Agent: It's not the best feature of [PRODUCT-1] for sure.
Agent: Anything else that we've missed that you all were specifically interested in seeing or Dr. [PERSON-25], if there is anything, I know you're a newer entrant into the conversation, but if there was anything that was specifically on your mind, happy to jump into those things too.
EndUser: Sorry, I know that question was directed for [PERSON-28]. And anybody. OK. I have a question, though, about the messages, some of these icons.
EndUser: Like, what is some of those in-app?
Agent: So in-app and push notifications, these are specific to mobile communications.
Agent: So if [ORG-1] now has a mobile app or has mobile apps in the future, You install [PRODUCT-6] in that app, and then you can do things like push banner notifications, push lock screen notifications out via that app.
Agent: Inbox communications work much the same way they just do it within within an email inbox so that once an email is delivered, we want to send another notification that emails they are waiting for you to see it.
Agent: Sms is what it sounds like. That's text messaging, [ORG-25]'s what it sounds like. That's for, you know, we see WhatsApp quite a bit with international recruiting, whether undergrad or graduate.
Agent: So that's another, another kind of out of the box connection that we have if you have WhatsApp or want to include WhatsApp in a journey, right?
Agent: It may be easier because of time zones and other things rather than trying to get someone just to go through email, give them the option, you know, look.
Agent: Send an email using interactive email would you prefer email check here or would you prefer to communicate via WhatsApp that would be a way to start segregating people by their preferred communication channel and give them an option to engage in both friends.
Agent: And we didn't talk much about the mobile studio components and I'm not sure how relevant they are or will be to you all with what you're doing but just to make sure that I've mentioned it.
Agent: There is the mobile code like [PERSON-3] said, the SMS, mobile code included within the Marketing Cloud additions in the mobile studio builder or when [PERSON-3] was showing those builders at the top and so that allows for the SMS sending of one two many like he's showing here and then there's also capabilities.
Agent: Again, may not be relevant, but for things like geo fencing around certain areas to send those triggered and targeted messages out like there's an open house event right near it or as you branch into more things like maybe current students become a part of [PRODUCT-1] [DATE-28], like notifications of tutoring options or events, things like that.
Agent: So all of that's available and included within marketing cloud. Those are just things that we didn't even get to talk much about [DATE-1], but I wanted to point out.
Agent: Any other questions, things that you need to know, want to know how to do, would like to do, can't do [DATE-1]. any of those questions.
EndUser: So this might have been mentioned to me, but is there any way like, is there like a test environment that we can play with it eventually?
EndUser: No, there is. No.
Agent: One of, so is this about before you evaluate and purchase or after when things are live?
Agent: Good question. I just said no straight. I was like, no, good, good ball of course.
Agent: And the reason I mention after things are live, one of, we see lots of customers, one of the uses of a business unit, when we were talking about that shared kind of organizational structure in marketing cloud, you could have a testing business unit where you go to do things in kind of a safe space, whether that's data integrations, Content tests, that sort of stuff.
Agent: And we see lots of campuses when they start to distribute marketing further to other departments.
Agent: That becomes kind of the training and safe space where people go to learn before they're activated and promoted up to the live sending business.
Agent: But there's not a trial. Unfortunately, there's not a trial. There's not a trial. You can have like a trial Marketing Cloud environment.
Agent: You can go through [LOC-1] and there may be some things you can do there that are like training related. [PERSON-1], but there isn't any ability to get into a trial for marketing.
Agent: Hopefully that gave you an idea of what, what. Marketing Cloud looks like [DATE-1] versus the Marketing Cloud that you have known up into this point.
Agent: Yeah, anything that we missed before we did great on time. I have a question. Yeah, since I was assuming it was like a different platform altogether since it's what we're already using and just add on.
EndUser: Do you still have to read to all the emails?
Agent: So you. The same. Yeah, you could absolutely migrate the existing [PRODUCT-5] that you have. There would be different methods for doing that. Off-prem can present different options. The lowest tech option, copy and paste.
Agent: There's also utility inside a [PRODUCT-1] called package manager, which is what it sounds like. You can bundle up packages, export them, import them into your new environment.
Agent: Or if you have colleagues at other campuses that have [PRODUCT-5] that you like, you can even share packages between campuses.
EndUser: So there are lots of methods, lots of methods, [PERSON-21], to replicate [PRODUCT-5] that you already have. It's not like the same system just add-ons to it. It's an actual different
Agent: Whole system we're using. It is. It is a differently architected system. It's not just a flip-a-switch upgrade to a code line thing. It is a new system.
Agent: But we built the ability and to migrate stuff that you want to keep. We don't expect that you would have to rebuild every email that you've ever sent.
Agent: That's something that package manager will do pretty quickly and deploy into your new environment.
EndUser: Ok. Thank you. Any
Agent: Good questions?
Agent: I think, [PERSON-25] is, I'll go with [PERSON-27] to, you know, get someone you all can speak with. Because I think functionality, or I shouldn't, you know, let me just ask the question, not as soon.
Agent: Did the functionality that we showed [DATE-1], like, do you feel like we've gotten their sort of checkbox on what you were hoping to see from functionality?
Agent: I think the outstanding question implemented like the, I was saying the question is still the recruit data possibilities.
EndUser: Yeah, I think that's the, the standing question of how it would look in recruit. I think it covered [DATE-1] so much. And I think truly it only kind of scratched the surface of, yeah.
EndUser: Options that could be added and implemented into what we are already doing and just to enhance everything that we do and be more efficient.
EndUser: I mean, I feel like it could take [DATE-21] to like really dive in and see all of the features.
EndUser: But at least on our side, I think truly seeing how it works with recruit and how it would defer to what it currently is now is like probably the number of questions.
Agent: Okay, so I will message [PERSON-9]. I know he's out. The rest of [DATE-25] on an on site in [GPE-3].
Agent: When do you all close for the semester?
Agent: [DATE-22] or [DATE-27]?
Agent: Are you are you around [DATE-27]?
Agent: What does that look like?
Agent: [PERSON-1]'s like, I'm here, I'm here forever. The 25nd is the official [DATE-27] here.
EndUser: Some of us take off earlier than that.
Agent: Yep, as you should, as you should. I'll get with [PERSON-9] and just see what options he has to offer as far as conversations and references that he might suggest.
Agent: I'm not sure if those references on the other side are around [DATE-27] either. I know some places are closing us up [DATE-22].
EndUser: So I'll take that as a big action item. Um, users, so like a lot of the stuff seems to be like you have to be a user in marketing cloud.
EndUser: You know how we are right now, we don't have very many users in there. Number one, we have to.
EndUser: Can we have a limited amount of users?
EndUser: Um, and we don't want everyone touching this because it's absolutely dangerous. So what is the user allowance and is that a,
Agent: You know, and what, and what we've been thinking through for you all in a new edition to accommodate email volume specifically [PRODUCT-5] contact volume, things like that. You're going to have more users.
Agent: Allocated to your account, then you will ever use. It comes with 99 users. And within the, you're not going to get to 92, that's just more of a, that's just utilization included.
Agent: But within user roles and permissions, if there are reasons to define different user roles and permissions for who can actually modify content, who can send content, who's approving [PRODUCT-5] before it goes out.
Agent: All of those are roles and permissions that get created and defined. But yeah, [PERSON-21], I don't foresee you needing 90, just
EndUser: That's what will be available. No. Okay. Thank you.
Agent: Yeah, no problem. And I know we are right over time.
Agent: So any other outstanding items for me to work on here, finding out some other conversations, but anything else that's top of mind and a big lingering question for anybody?
EndUser: I guess I'm just thinking like, step. So we'll talk, try and get that conversation with another recruit user. And then I think our recruit team is like looking at what ethos timeline is, though it might be very long.
EndUser: And [PERSON-21], I'm looking at you, but I know that you probably don't want me to look at you for that.
EndUser: Because like, like my eggs are right in and the eat. Well, I know. It's another, it's another team that we have to work with, which is.
EndUser: Yeah, did it get did it happen on the 10?
EndUser: Well, we have we're on practice the test or whatever. We're on [DATE-26]. Yeah. So we're on [DATE-26]. So I guess it's somewhere on the back end, but we have to have like ethos. Yeah.
EndUser: You actually install it. It exists. It is a real thing in the world. It exists. But I can't say anything on the record. I like that it exists. They say it exists. That exists. Yeah. That's a positive step.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: So yes, [PERSON-17], if that's the if that of the integration path of interest and those are there are those questions. I think to [PERSON-9]'s point, there may be ways to do integration now that don't prevent.
Agent: Don't prevent leveraging ethos once it's available from the team fully to consider, right?
Agent: You know, if you can't take the whole big leap into ethos immediately, maybe there are ways, and you know, [PERSON-9], we mentioned SFTP even, things like that can be put into place potentially. But that's a good point.
EndUser: And then- Yeah, I keep us like on scale. schedule because I know that our clock is ticking towards [DATE-34].
EndUser: And so I want to at least make sure that we're making some progress towards Implementation of this product, knowing we need other,
Agent: You know, solutions to get the data over. Yeah. And there's another thing that I'm thinking about as I know I've shared with everybody on this call, so sorry to be a program record.
Agent: But is the [DATE-34], right?
Agent: So it's [DATE-37]. [PERSON-9]'s turned out a little bit on the lower end as well, potentially for your implementation.
Agent: But I like to be a pessimist in terms of timelines on Implementation just because we all know how that goes, right?
Agent: So if we say, funny to [DATE-26], Well, that's kicking off a project in [DATE-33]-ish, right?
Agent: And you're not sending, you're sending far before that [DATE-26] to be clear.
Agent: But wanting to be able to say, let's cut the contracts we have now and move off of it, not have duplicative costs coming into the new fiscal.
Agent: That puts you in probably a name something executed in [DATE-37], which as we talked about, I also have incentives available to save costs for a [DATE-37] purchase.
Agent: And all of those things that we haven't gone into full detail about yet.
Agent: But I'm happy to, even if that's [DATE-27], whoever the right folks are, if it's to you, [PERSON-27], [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-21], go through what that incentive cost means tangibly.
Agent: If it's easier to see it, we can go through that too. Cause I've just sort of thrown out numbers of what that might look like, but I'm happy to say.
Agent: Let's go in and actually look at it, cost benefit of a [DATE-37] purchase versus a [DATE-33] purchase.
EndUser: If that's helpful. If we can, yes, I think we're in the throes of budget pitching right now and if this is to be implemented [DATE-34], like this is the time.
EndUser: I'm out quite a bit [DATE-27], but I'm also going to be driving a lot. So like I
Agent: Can't understand. Like we could even give something, you know, like, like I'm hoping [DATE-22] [TIME-4] even.
Agent: I mean, I just I would have to work with my manager to put together some stuff, but If [DATE-22] [TIME-4] is even better so that you're not driving in a car to listen to numbers of I'm fine.
Agent: I can do that.
Agent: Are you talking this [DATE-22] or [DATE-26]?
Agent: Yeah, the 17th. I can even I can we can get some any other better than
EndUser: Yeah, if we could do like a quick [TIME-5] just like quick numbers.
EndUser: That way I didn't have maybe some of [DATE-27] to sit and let it, you know, let me tell [PERSON-9] a couple times, you know, drop through it and then, yeah, you got to be helpful.
EndUser: [PERSON-4], are you, are you out?
EndUser: I will probably be driving. Okay.
EndUser: Good [TIME-4], but, um, I'm happy to jump on a call or if [PERSON-25] and if you want to take that one. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I can do [DATE-26]. I can do [DATE-26] at
Agent: 21 or I can do [DATE-22] anytime after [TIME-6].
EndUser: [ORG-22] doesn't look great, but I could do. Any like two or three. Ready time after three and then [PERSON-4], I can loop you in on what those numbers are. Well, you went and then.
EndUser: Yeah, I want to invite. And if I can join if I'm sitting in a car, then I'll join while.
Agent: Awesome. Well, I'll get that together. I'll send over the invite. And this way we just slide out, you know, and we see how things move forward from here. We'll talk then.
EndUser: Sounds good. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much. Great. Thanks for your time, everyone. Thank you.

The customer did express interest in the product's capabilities and how it could potentially enhance their current processes. However, they also had questions about how the product would integrate with their existing systems, particularly their recruitment system. They mentioned that they would need to have a conversation with another recruit user and look at the ethos timeline. Therefore, it is not entirely clear if they feel the product meets their needs without further information.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and demonstrating the features of the product. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. Data Integration: The sales rep briefly touched upon data integration with the customer's existing systems, but did not spend enough time understanding the specific data sources and how they would be integrated with the product.
2. User Access: The sales rep mentioned that the product comes with 99 users, but did not spend enough time understanding the customer's current user access and how it would need to be adjusted for the new product.
3. Implementation Timeline: The sales rep mentioned the implementation timeline, but did not spend enough time understanding the customer's specific timeline and how it would impact the implementation process.
4. Budget and Incentives: The sales rep briefly mentioned budget and incentives, but did not spend enough time understanding the customer's budget constraints and how the incentives could be used to offset the costs.
5. Competitors: The sales rep did not mention any competitors or how the product compares to other similar products in the market.

Overall, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific needs and challenges in these areas to provide a more tailored demonstration and pitch.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the interactive email feature of the seller's product, which allows for the collection of information from recipients directly within the email. They also mentioned the potential for this feature to increase engagement and the possibility of passing hidden fields for progressive forms. The customer also mentioned the potential for this feature to lower the friction required to get information from someone and make it easier to collect.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information on any specific concerns or objections expressed by the customer that would prevent the deal from closing. The customer did express interest in understanding how the data from the seller's product would integrate with their existing systems, specifically recruit, and how it would look in their system. However, this does not necessarily indicate a concern or objection that would prevent the deal from closing.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked several open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""Is there value there from the pieces that [PERSON-3] shows above and beyond what you have [DATE-1]?""
2. ""If there are questions, comments, thoughts as we go through, we'd love to hear that and make sure that we are on the right path with what we show.""
3. ""Any objections, questions, burning thoughts or requests before we hop into it.""
4. ""So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5]. Questions about that?""
5. ""So once we have the data, we can do fun things with it. Any questions about this?""
6. ""So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5]. Questions about that?""
7. ""So any piece of data that [ORG-1] has, you can connect to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud data model. Yes, the majority of that data today lives and recruit. But if that changes in the future, if there are new efforts in the future, or if you just want to expand what you're doing, because there's a lot of efficiency that we'll find in [PRODUCT-1] now, you can do that pretty easily, and you can spin up these hubs and spokes as needed.""
8. ""So if in the future, there's a different [ORG-6] or a different financial aid system, or just some really important VIP recruiting spreadsheet that you get from somewhere that needs to be related into the system so you can use it. There is a way to do that. That's what the data designer, what [PRODUCT-1] data is about.""
9. ""So questions about data or any of that stuff with the understanding that a huge portion of the work for data design and making this happen is what [PERSON-9] from [ORG-9] discussed with you [DATE-3].""
10. ""So once we have a... question. Sorry. This might be maybe more of an offline question for [PERSON-10] afterwards.""
11. ""So if you think of those vertical communication channels, let's just call them web text and email, you manage those kind of separately and individual ly a day and that causes problems with efficiency because you have to repeat efforts and you' re trying to knit those things together.""
12. ""So if that sounds good to everybody, I'll turn it over to [PERSON-3].""
13. ""Any objections, questions, burning thoughts or requests before we hop into it.""
14. ""So once we have the data, we can do fun things with it. Any questions about this?""
15. ""So one of the first things that you might want to do is some segmentation or suppression. Here I am inside of email studio, excuse me, email studio and I am creating a data filter.""
16. ""So maybe you want to create a special campaign that's focusing only on out-of-state students. So we wanna look for a state not equal to [GPE-1] and we can do as many nested and ors as we want here.""
17. ""So if we wanted this to be and this to be or, or if you wanna create really interesting program specific, defined specific degree programs, degree tracks, If you're looking for only women from a certain zip code that you want to target with some sort of outreach, you can do that.""
18. ""The idea is that any piece of data that you have, you can define drag and drop.""
19. ""So this, I hope this sounds more fun than it looks because this is kind of the least <inaudible> thing in terms of what it looks like in marketing cloud, but it's probably the most powerful because this opens up literally any piece of data with roles and permissions to anyone who needs to use it in their context.""
20. ""So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5]. Questions about that?""
21. ""So the data filters will show up everywhere. We'll see them again in [PRODUCT-5] targeting.""",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question: ""So I love this. This is the kind of stuff that I geek out over. How would this information look like coming back into recruit? Like... I'm trying to envision what it would look like because I can see the person record and the activities and the emails that they're receiving, although for us, texts aren't on there and things like that.""
   Answer: The customer seemed more engaged because they started thinking about ways to implement the solution and how it would integrate with their existing systems.

2. Question: ""Do you have other institutions or another, maybe, user that is a recruit, a [NORP-1] user that is currently using [WORK_OF_ART-1], anyone that might be interested in chatting with us, that could show us real time, kind of how they do it?""
   Answer: The customer seemed more engaged because they showed interest in learning from other users' experiences and seeing real-world examples of the solution in action.

3. Question: ""I'm not thinking metrics, but I'm thinking about you know, calendaring and sending that out. I think about an email that [PERSON-4] sends every [DATE-25] of like, here's what's upcoming for our, like, here's the communications that are going out. Now that may be different now if we incorporate your new builder because those, some of those triggered communications, but some of those date specific communications that we want our team to know and be aware of as their students get in.""

1.

2. When discussing the possibility of using Marketing Cloud for mobile communications, the sales rep mentioned the different types of mobile communications, such as push notifications, in-app messages, and SMS.

3. When discussing the possibility of using Marketing Cloud for digital advertising, the sales rep mentioned that it is not included out of the box with the Marketing Cloud but can be added if the customer would like.

Agent: Ready to go, perfect. I was just waiting for that little bond, know that the Recording had started. Thanks, [PERSON-2].
Agent: Okay guys, so we had a chat about probably [DATE-1], maybe a little bit longer now that we had a bit of a conversation around kind of, you know, where [PERSON-3] was going, where you are growing, and how you are looking to really leverage more data intelligence, more artificial intelligence, and using that to drive your customer experience.
Agent: So within [ORG-1], we have this term [PERSON-4]. So we kind of productize all of our different artificial intelligence areas of platform with that term [PERSON-4] beforehand.
Agent: Okay, so you'll hear lots and lots of different areas of the platform with the name [PERSON-4] in front of them [DATE-2].
Agent: And what we wanted to do in [DATE-2]'s session, so in [DATE-2]'s session, we just want to kind of, I suppose, inspire a little bit.
Agent: We want to show you a little bit of the functionalities that we have around [PERSON-4] for the Marketing Cloud platform and how we could look to increase the relevance and the context when you're communicating with your customers across all the different channels.
Agent: So we want to drill into some of those areas that we think would be really, really functional and really, really helpful for you guys.
Agent: Now, I'm going to show a couple of slides just to kind of set the scene around what we're going to talk about. And the first slide I have to show is this particular one here.
Agent: So this is just a legal statement that we have to show at the start of our call, just to let you know that [ORG-1] is a publicly traded company.
Agent: Everything we are going to show you [DATE-2] is currently available.
Agent: But should we make any forward-looking statements or should we talk about any roadmap functionality?
Agent: All purchasing decisions should be made on currently available technology. Okay. You don't have to read all of this, don't worry. We can print it at the end too.
Agent: So [ORG-1] itself is really a platform and when we talk about a platform what we mean by that is the ability for you to to build on top of the [ORG-1] layer all of the different communication strategies that you would want across all of the different business areas that you would use to engage with your customers.
Agent: So when we talk about the [ORG-1] platform, it's really all about, you know, how can we leverage these different tools to improve our customer experience, improve our internal employee engagement, improve the satisfaction across the board to make sure we are delivering the best representation of our business to our customers.
Agent: And as you can see here, it covers many, many different areas where we would interact and engage with our customers. And of course, we're going to be focusing on this Marketing component of the Salesforce Customer 341 platform [DATE-2].
Agent: So within the Marketing area, there are lots and lots of different areas where we use artificial intelligence to drive effective customer engagement. Okay, and we do that in a couple of different ways.
Agent: So one is to really [ORG-2] how we're communicating with our customers.
Agent: One is optimizing the performance to make sure that we're getting a lot of visual insights, we're getting a lot of understanding of how different campaigns are performing, and then we actually need to be able to make sure that we're actioning all of those different insights.
Agent: So we're not just getting surfaced that information that we're doing something with it, that we have actionable insight that we can go ahead and we can use across all of our different Marketing campaigns.
Agent: And in each of those different pillars, there's lots and lots of different pieces of functionality. So you can see, you know, we have [PERSON-5]-time optimization, engagement scoring, Marketing insights, Content tagging and selection.
Agent: Okay, that's just a couple of examples of the areas of [PERSON-4] that we have across the Marketing platform.
Agent: But not all of these pieces of functionality are necessarily going to be the ones that are gonna deliver the most value for you.
Agent: So we wanted to kind of drill into a couple of areas that based on our conversation, the last.
Agent: Time we really think will be beneficial for [PERSON-6] and will help you kind of move forward and increase your customer engagement . So the first one is personalization recipes.
Agent: So this is basically making sure that we are recommending the best product, the best content, the best categories of restaurants, of food that people can go ahead and engage with.
Agent: And we wanna do that in real-time across the mobile app and of course through all of the email communication that we are sending out as well. And really, this is all being driven by behavior tracking.
Agent: So it's understanding all the behavior that's happening within the mobile app and being able to create what we call affinity modeling in the back end to really understand what each customer, what each prospective customer is up to.
Agent: And then we boost all of that using our machine learning algorithms to make sure that we are delivering those one-to-one personalized recommendations in real-time across those different channels.
Agent: And this is one of the areas that I'm going to drill into a little bit further when we jump into the demo component, alongside the personalization decisions.
Agent: Okay, and this is really all about delivering next best action, next best offer. So this is using an algorithm called contextual bandit, so it's a multi-arm bandit that basically goes through.
Agent: And again, it looks at everything that has happened on an individual's record, but it also looks at all of the different offers, the different promotions, the different [PRODUCT-1] that's available and it looks at that in relation to business value.
Agent: S o what is the promotion or the offer that's going to deliver the most value fo r the customer but also the most value for the business ?
Agent: And how can we balance the two two make sure we are putting that next best offer in front of the right customers.
Agent: And then I'll be handing it over to [PERSON-7] who's going to go through a little bit more of the kind of the [PERSON-4] components when we're talking about messaging.
Agent: So talking about how we can use kind of some natural language processing to understand what tones, what words, what phrases we're using within our subject lines to try and get people to engage with the email [PRODUCT-1] that we're sending out and making sure that we're getting some actionable insights about how we can go ahead and we can optimize those subject lines.
Agent: There's also an area within [PRODUCT-2] selection.
Agent: So this is really all about making sure that, you know, within one single template, within one single email that's being sent out, that single email can look completely different to each and every individual that will open it.
Agent: Okay, it's going to be completely personalized in terms of, the banner, their header imagery, the content, the recommendations that are within that email.
Agent: And really, that's all being optimized to make sure that as soon as someone opens that email, they're going to be delivered the best piece of [PRODUCT-1] based on their most recent interaction.
Agent: Even if that email was, say, sent to [TIME-1] on a [DATE-3] [TIME-2], they happen to have engaged with the app at [DATE-4], maybe to order some breakfast, and then they go and look at the email.
Agent: That email will be able to change automatically in real-time based on that most recent interaction, even after the email was being sent out. Okay. And then the final pieces are in kind of Einstein Content tagging.
Agent: So helping to really organize all of your content, to help you decide, you know, how best to tag it, how best to organize all of your [PRODUCT-1] into a searchable library so that it will make it a lot easier for you to find, to search all of your content, and we'll make sure that you're just working within an area because we talk before about quite a large [PRODUCT-1] catalog.
Agent: So being able to see which are the images that are going to work most well for you for all of your different campaigns and making sure that you're able to find them very, very easily as well.
Agent: Ok. Hopefully, these features, these functionalities, these areas sound like they line up with what you're looking for based on our previous call.
Agent: But I'll just stop, I'll pause here for a second and just see if anyone has any comments, any questions so far.
EndUser: I just have a question more.
EndUser: How does I should AI decide, learns about customer, preference communication and channel, like time of [DATE-5], can I be tailored specific service or group to be one and like, what is the basic flexibility of adjusting the model?
Agent: So each of the different areas have slightly different models. So I kind of mentioned a couple. So there's been affinity model, there's been contextual bandit. There's also some alternating least squares that are being used in the recommendations.
Agent: So there's slightly different models for each one.
EndUser: It sounds like you're about the
Agent: Talking about send time optimization because you were talking best time to send out different emails. I'm not sure of the exact model that's used there.
Agent: But basically, the first time someone is sent to communication, we don't know anything about that person. We don't know. necessarily know when the best time to send it is.
Agent: But what we'll do is we'll look at people wit h similar behaviors, similar characteristics and say, right, well, similar people to that perso n tend to open the email at that time.
Agent: So for the first send, that's when they'll start to sen d that email.
Agent: But as that individual starts to engage more and more with the email [PRODUCT-1] that you'r e sending out, starts to engage more in the background with [GPE-1], we start to get more of an understandin g about when they're active and when they're most engaged.
Agent: And then going forward, [ORG-3] l you'll start to optimize their send time s.
EndUser: So it's not just using their engagement with the app, but also the channel and just wondering what level of parameters that we talked about here, because I'll give you our use case that we were thinking.
EndUser: We wanna optimize right time of descent, but we also know when I understand the time of the [GPE-2] specific service, for example, if you wanna go down the road.
EndUser: So that's why just to see if there is a flexibility to do something like that.
Agent: So when you say a specific service, so do you mean within the different offerings of <inaudible> house or do you mean different channels of communication?
EndUser: No, not channels, different offerings. We call services like right healing versus food. Okay. Yes.
EndUser: So yeah, users behave really differently for right heal versus food, right?
EndUser: Yeah. And food is sometimes, yeah, quite more frequent, which is right healing. And you can detect natural behavior amongst the two. So we're wondering like,
Agent: So you
Agent: Have one profile for each of the individual because it's going to look at all of the [PRODUCT-1] that is sent and then it will create a pattern for each individual.
Agent: But can do is within a window of send, you can actually choose what range you want to offer.
EndUser: What you
Agent: So for example, for a product that is a high-frequency purchase, when you send a communication, you can decide to choose the best time in a window of [TIME-3].
EndUser: So it's restricted
Agent: And then if it's for low frequency purchase, then you can put a [DATE-6] window and then it will pick the best time and date within [DATE-7].
EndUser: Okay. I assume there is also fallback timing and stuff like that, customization to.
Agent: If there's no information, then it will be sent at the preset date and time.
EndUser: Clear. Perfect.
Agent: Any other questions around any bad or any follow on questions from there?
Speaker 5: I just have a quick question on the offer optimization that you mentioned.
Speaker 5: So like one of the features that you mentioned here is that it's able to identify what is the right sort of offer for each customer and then plan. that if I'm correct.
Speaker 5: What I want to do, like, understand is that like, which offer work, which did not, there can be multiple criteria to judge that, right?
Speaker 5: So, some people might look at C-PAIR, some might look at customer acquisition cost, and then there are multiple others.
Speaker 5: So, is it possible for us to define the criteria of campaign success for [PERSON-4], and then based on that, optimize it?
Agent: Yeah, so I mean if I look at the screen that we have here, okay, so there are There is the ability for you to engineer to feature engineer the algorithm that runs those personalization decisions for next best off for next best action.
Agent: So you have the ability to influence it fairly heavily for all the different criteria that is important to you.
Agent: And it's actually not showing it on this screen here, but there's a little area that you can select right at the top that says, do you want to optimize this for conversions, for clicks, for purchases.
Agent: So you are able to select kind of what your overall or overarching goal is.
Agent: Or if it's something like customer lifetime value but those are pre-set goals It is impossible for you to create your own goal You would have to select one of those [ORG-4] r and then you would be able to influence i t through the feature engineering that we see on screen here .
Speaker 5: Alright, yeah, that address is part of the question and then again, you know, like. If you kind of try to kind of. Map it without doing right now and how we can use asking for this, but.
Speaker 5: Lot of questions that might come up and I want to kind of block the entire time for that.
Speaker 5: So do you guys have any sort of demo interface which which we can, you know, like me play around way to know how things are working and can be more specific in our questions. Maybe.
Agent: So we don't actually offer trial or demo versions that customers can access.
Agent: But what we can do is [DATE-2], as I said, we're looking to it as an inspiration session to just make sure that we're on point with what you guys are looking for.
Agent: And then we can do deeper dive sessions into each of the individual areas that interest you most, and we can, of course, get more into the technicalities and the back ends of those different areas through further screen shares.
Speaker 5: All right, thanks for clarifying, [PERSON-8]. No worries. Thank you.
Agent: Okay. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to jump in and I'm just going to show you a little bit of some of the areas that I've mentioned. So the recipes and the [PERSON-4] decisions. Okay.
Agent: Now, I'm going to show you this through the context of a kind of a fictitious business that we have created for demonstration purposes. Okay.
Agent: Now, this particular business is it's an it's an outdoor kind of hiking and equipment branded store. So, bit similar to like the north face. Okay.
Agent: So when I've come to this particular website now, I'm actually visiting as an anonymous visitor.
Agent: And I think the important thing to mention here is I'm going to focus just on the web channel for the purposes of this demonstration, but exactly the same sort of behavior can be tracked and can be logged across the mobile app.
Agent: Okay, still a little bit more visual to be able to show it from the website in terms of the demonstration.
Agent: So I'm an anonymous visitor on the website right now, and everything on the website's quite generic, okay?
Agent: So I've got the call to action to join a loyalty program. I've got different areas and categorizations that I can go ahead and interact with.
Agent: So of course these could be, if we were to think about, you know, the food sites, the food ordering side of <inaudible>, these could be the different categories of restaurants, the different categories of cuisine, that I could go ahead and then interact with.
Agent: So for example, I might go ahead and I might click into the women category here and then start to kind of narrow down my search by starting to look at footwear.
Agent: And again, just kind of use your imagination a little bit to kind of run with me and talk about this in terms of the categorizations that we might have for, like I said, for the locality of the cuisine or the different cuisines and types of food ordering services that we have.
Agent: Okay. So I'll scroll down here and I'm actually going to go ahead and I'm going to filter this activity here by running.
Agent: So I can go ahead and I can drill down even deeper into all of the different products and to all of the different categories that are available.
Agent: And I'm going to go and I'm going to click on these kind of gray and pink nice running shoes. So a couple of things are already happening on this particular website right now.
Agent: So one thing is I'm being told how many people are viewing this product right now. So this could be something that could be interesting to people from a restaurant perspective.
Agent: So if there are a lot of people engaging with a restaurant at the moment or a lot of people pushing through orders at the moment, potentially that might tell someone, this particular restaurant is very, very busy.
Agent: There might be a longer lead time for my order. Maybe I might wanna go in and check. a different restaurant with similar cuisine that's also in the locality as well .
Agent: This tends to work as just to show either popularity of a restaurant or potentially to show that urgency. I want to get my order in right now because there's a lot of people browsing, a lot of people engaging.
Agent: Now, if I scroll down a little bit further here, we're already starting to make some recommendations. So in this particular use case, we're just looking at similar items.
Agent: So we're looking at different things that we know about the product that someone's engaging with.
Agent: So whether that is the cuisine itself, whether that's the certain ingredients of the cuisine or the different dishes that they're looking at, we can go ahead and then start to make some recommendations about potentially similar items.
Agent: And all of this is, and all of this is still happening now in that anonymous state OK ?
Agent: So even in this anonymous state, in the background, we are creating a record within [PRODUCT-3] for all of that activity and all of that engagement.
Agent: And if I go ahead and click into one of these anonymous records, this is what it actually looks like in the background. This is the kind of the customer profile that's being built on this particular anonymous visitor.
Agent: And what it's doing here is it's picking up IP address information. So we know what city and what locality someone is interested in. We can see if they've ever had any purchases with us.
Agent: We get their average order value or their customer lifetime value.
Agent: And on this timeline in the middle, we'd be able to see the different dates, the different times that they've been interacting on the mobile app, or potentially making any orders.
Agent: Okay, so we're getting lots and lots of information even though this person is anonymous.
Agent: For probably the most powerful part of this profile is really coming from this affinity matrix that we see at the top here, or this affinity wheel that we see at the top.
Agent: Now this is completely customizable, okay?
Agent: So this is, you know, kind of driven towards that e-commerce, that online retail business we were just looking at. And it's looking at things like, you know, the categories of, you know, running outdoors, hiking.
Agent: It's also looking at the different styles of the items and maybe other different attributes about those items. As we said, this could be the different categories of the different cuisines. It could be dish types.
Agent: It could be specific ingredients. It could also be things to look out for people, like if they're gluten free, if they have another allergy, if they have some sort of intolerance.
Agent: We could also be Recording that information based on the dishes or the different restaurants that they're engaging with as well. OK. I'm sorry. Sorry.
EndUser: This is all.
EndUser: Depending on the level of data we provide, right?
EndUser: Or we can define basically like mapping within the [ORG-5] studio.
Agent: Yeah, so it's basically actually all being driven by a catalog, either a catalog of [PRODUCT-1] or a catalog of products.
Agent: So if we look at think of like, obviously, in this case, because we're talking about an online e-commerce retailer, they're actual individual products, okay?
Agent: And they have all of these kind of tags and these categorizations associated with them. For you, it would be more of a [PRODUCT-1] catalog.
Agent: So it would be, you know, imagery, blocks of text, different information about the restaurants, you know, promotions that are aligned to. different restaurants and categories as well. Okay now.. .
Agent: We would say recommend that this all gets uploaded as a kind of an individual kind of catalog. That's kind of the easiest way for it to get ingested into the system.
Agent: And then we would say, you know, create these different kind of attributes, these different dimensions that you want to record.
Agent: And the more of these attributes and the more of these dimensions, you can record around those different pieces of content, then kind of the deeper and the more granular we can go into our recommendations.
Agent: Does that answer your question?
Agent: Yeah, yeah,
EndUser: Yeah. Actually, yes. OK, perfect, perfect.
Agent: Ok, and so obviously, you know, that profile that we have, that affinity wheel, all of that event stream and that event tracking, all of that is being kind of built up to build this picture in the background of, you know, our anonymous engagers or also of our prospective customers and returning customers as well.
Agent: And all of that data is then being used in this machine learning area.
Agent: So for these [PERSON-4] recipes, so that we can go ahead and we can make different recommendations to all of the different users that are interacting across the system.
Agent: So we saw those, you know, those similar items that we were seeing down the bottom on this particular page here. That's being driven by machine learning in the background.
Agent: It's looking at just, like I said, all of the different attributes on someone's record and finding similar items based on the product. page they're currently engaging with.
Agent: But this could also be, you know, trending items, most popular items, or it could be next best recommended product for you as well .
Agent: Now, if I scroll up here and I go back to my home page, so a couple of things are now going to change on the home page based on when I was that initial anonymous visitor.
Agent: And it's these call to actions here. So these are my kind of my next best actions that are popping up on the screen here. So I've been engaging with a running shoe, been engaging with that particular product.
Agent: So my next best action is to go ahead and start to engage further with the running category. So now it's sort of saying, right, we know you're interested.
Agent: Interested in running shoes, what about engaging with the running category so you can loo k at other things like running leggings, running jackets, maybe fitness trackers, things lik e that.
Agent: So it's starting to try and get me to engage with the broader category rather tha n just trying to drill down and only go ahead and recommend the information about the specifi c dish or the specific restaurant I was looking at .
Agent: Okay. And then another call to action here is just to go ahead, you know, to register, to join a community, to share ratings, to share feedback and things like that.
Agent: Now in this particular case, I'm going to go ahead and I'm start to kind of navigate like I'm moving away from the website.
Agent: And again, this is just another call to action that's popping up to try and get someone to leave their email address.
Agent: Now in the case of [PERSON-6], pretty much everybody's already going to be identified on the mobile app, but we can just have, you know, those triggers or those indicators that someone is about to navigate away from the app or close the app down and use that kind of behavioral triggers, maybe pop up a push notification or an in-app message with some sort of little offer or a little promotion to try and get them to complete their order or try and get them to, you know, complete their ride and just go ahead and try to get, you know, the optimize that conversion as much as possible before they navigate away.
Agent: Okay. And I heard a little ping-bong there. So I'll have some right hand.
EndUser: Yeah.
Speaker 5: Those are the reasons. So like I just said, a question on the personalization that you spoke of. So what I want to understand is that on that part, there are two aspects.
Speaker 5: One is capturing the intent of the user, which you kind of in here said that the user is interested in running. And the next is action. And that is display this [PRODUCT-1] card. or give this offer.
Speaker 5: So, like within this personalization, how do we define, you know, what are the intents to tag users to?
Speaker 5: And then, like, what are the levers we have to then define, so how we basically put actions against those intents?
Agent: Yeah, yeah. So that all gets created when you're actually creating the campaign itself.
Agent: So whether you're creating it as a web campaign, a mobile campaign, or an email campaign, you can actually, you know, you decide the piece of [PRODUCT-1] that you want, and then you attribute the different actions.
Agent: So whether it's something like it's exit intent, whether it's a different pop up, whether it's a particular type of group of recommendations that you want to go ahead and attribute to that, you will define those rules as you're creating the campaign in there.
Agent: As well .
Agent: Okay, so it's really, it's what we kind of call almost gray or white box kind of algorithms because you do have the ability to influence it and to tweak it, but you can't completely remodel it or design absolutely everything about it.
Agent: There's a certain level of the algorithms that's kind of locked down, but you do have that ability to sort of to influence that, you know, the intent, do different triggers and the outcome that you're trying to generate. Okay.
EndUser: Just one question here.
EndUser: This means that basically model can predict the simulate set of users based on their engagement with the content, right?
EndUser: We don't need to even go into the transactions.
Agent: Into individual purchases?
EndUser: Yeah, yeah.
Agent: No, no, no. So I mean, yeah, we can we can start to make recommendations and we can start to make, you know, next best actions on someone simply based on how they've been engaging.
Agent: They don't necessarily ever have to have converted to a purchase. There's a lot of information that you can kind of gather from someone just about how they're engaging.
Agent: Like, I know I actually do this, I'm terrible for this, on the Just Eat app here in [GPE-3].
Agent: I will always, when I'm a little bit hungover and I maybe have few too many drinks, I'm always on the app and I'm like faffing around, I can't decide like do I want to like.
Agent: Eat loads of carbs, I don't want to be really healthy And then I'll keep closing the act down Because I'm like, no, you should make something [PERSON-1], I don't order anything I have that internal conflict with myself So I'm not ordering necessarily at that time But there's lots and lots of informatio n about those patterns that are quite interestin g to learn about me This happens every [DATE-8] morning [PERSON-1] clearly has a little conflict with hersel f about what she wants to order And maybe if a little in that message popped up and said we're going to give you [PERCENT-1] off a few orde r in [DATE-9] .
Agent: Might be the little trigger I need to just be like, yeah, that's the world of the universe telling me I need to order all the cards, you [PERSON-9] Yeah, So yeah, [PERCENT-2] can be driven by the behavior side of things as well.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: And this can be, we can be, can choose what we want to like drive as a goal, right?
EndUser: Like, would it be based on the behavior or transactions?
EndUser: We can switch this.
Agent: Is this Yeah, so the algorithms and cells, so something like the recommendations, like the [PERSON-4] recipes, like we're looking at on screen here and the decisions, they are always going to be driven by behavior and by transactions.
EndUser: The local customization?
Agent: Just that's just the way the algorithms are built.
Agent: It will always take them into account, but it will prioritize the purchases and the transactions because they're the things that you actually converted on and the things that you actually bought.
Agent: The behavior side of things is interesting as well to influence it, but it will put a heavier weighting on the conversions and the purchases. mattress . but it will always take both of them into account.
EndUser: Perfect, perfect.
Agent: Okay, so just to quickly show you then what a record might look like for someone who is a little bit more built up, who's a little bit more engaged, so you can start to see that the different areas of the affinity wheel are just building out a lot more on this particular person's record.
Agent: We've got their lifetime value, how many orders, their average order value here as well. And also you can see all of these different kind of bubbles on the timeline.
Agent: And each of these represents a visit to the app or to the website. And the bigger that bubble, the longer that particular person has been engaging with the app, the more they've been engaging with the content.
Agent: Now the thing about this is it's probably going to be very, very rare, but you would ever really want to look at an individual person's record.
Agent: But the idea of this is just to give you an idea of all of the information that's being captured in order to feed the artificial intelligence engine.
Agent: So that you understand how it's being built out, the event stream of all of the data that's being captured, how they're being driven into the different kind of the segments so that we can go ahead and make those recommendations.
Agent: But the likelihood of you ever actually drilling down and looking at race So this record is probably actually pretty small . Okay, unless maybe she brings in, she has a service complaint or some sort of service issue. Okay.
Agent: So, In terms of the initial part of the demo to show you a little bit around [PERSON-4] personalization [PERSON-4] decisions. I'm going to stop it there.
Agent: Okay, as I said, we can do further sessions to deep dive into each of these areas, but I want to give [ORG-6]
Agent: A little bit of time to drill into the [PRODUCT-1] side of things because I know the [PRODUCT-1] tracking the insights and things like that. We're very important as well.
Agent: But just before I swap over, just to check if there's any more questions or any other comments there at all.
Agent: Not for
EndUser: My shade. Okay, perfect, perfect.
Agent: Okay, so I'm just going to stop sharing my screen. I'm going to hand it over to [PERSON-10]. As I said, those two areas were what we call [PERSON-4] recommendations, [PERSON-4] decisions for an aspects action.
Agent: So we can do individual sessions on each of those if needed, and I'll hand you over to [PERSON-7] now so she can jump through the other areas of [PERSON-4]. Thanks guys. Thank
EndUser: You.
Agent: Perfect. Thank you, [PERSON-1]. So just before I actually jump into the [PRODUCT-1] creation, I'm going to give you a broad overview of the Marketing platform.
Agent: So here the idea is that on the home page you really have the comment center where you're going to be able to pilot the different activities.
Agent: So what you have is first on the left you have all of your different studios and you have to imagine that the studio is a Marketing channel that you can activate.
Agent: So you're going to find all of your emails anything regarding mobile so that will take into account SMS, WhatsApp, but also anything regarding push and push notification in app.
Agent: You also have the capacity to link with social media platform for organic posting or for paid advertising campaign. And then you have the link with your desk or your app or your desktop website, which would be [ORG-7].
Agent: And that's what [PERSON-1] just showed you before. Once you have all of the different channels, you can then activate them and you can create experience with by mixing all of these channels together.
Agent: So that's what we would find in the different builders. The builders will allow you to create connected experience.
Agent: So for example, in [ORG-8], that's where you're going to be able to build multi-channel engagement programs to start sending [PRODUCT-1] to your customers and then being able to adapt your behavior depending on what they are doing and how they are engaging.
Agent: So typically, that's in [ORG-8], that you would build maybe, and welcome programs, birthday programs, engagement programs, re-engagement programs for inactive users, those kind of scenarios.
Agent: What we also have is all of the different [PERSON-4] capabilities related to Marketing cloud.
Agent: So just like [PERSON-1] mentioned a little bit at the beginning of the presentation in the slides, we have a lot of artificial intelligence features that are naturally integrated on the platform.
Agent: So [DATE-2] I'll make a focus especially on [FAC-1] selection and I'll show you how we can use engagement scoring, same time optimization and engagement frequency directly within our journey tool.
Agent: Do you have any questions so far?
Agent: Okay, perfect.
Agent: So what I'll do is right away, I'll detail into our [PRODUCT-1] builder, which is kind of our library of assets, which is the place where I'm able to create Marketing content, [ORG-2] that content, and then use that [PRODUCT-1] in my different journeys or for my different communications.
Agent: So typically here, I'll show you an example of a Marketing email for [ORG-9], so the same brand as [PERSON-1] used before.
Agent: So I'll show you how very easily we can create that content, use the different building functionalities, and then how we can add a layer of artificial intelligence to [ORG-2] the display of that email.
Agent: But first big first things first.
Agent: So when we open the email, when we open our builder, we have on the left the different components that can then be used to drag and drop on the canvas and then build the different blocks of our email.
Agent: So what we can see is that we have the basic components that are necessary to build our content. So for example, the button to add the call to action.
Agent: We also have the text, the image block that allows us to Personalize the email very easily. I just drag, I drop the block on my canvas and I can build my email.
Agent: But what we also have is more advanced functionalities that will allow us to go further in the way we are customizing our email.
Agent: The first one is AD testing, we can create different variation within one email to try different content.
Agent: We can also create dynamic Content where we will display different blocks, different components depending on the value of a field, so the value of an attribute for each customer.
Agent: For example, depending on their preferred food or their preferred services with Chareem, we could display different banners, different promotions, different offers.
Agent: What we also have is the link with artificial intelligence in order to automatically suggest some [PRODUCT-1] depending on the pool of assets, the pool of pictures and banners that the [PRODUCT-4] will select from depending on the set of criteria.
Agent: So this is where I'll deep dive a little bit more.
Agent: Just before I deep dive, I'll also show you how directly within emails we're going to be able to add forms, so it's called interactive forms, which we allow us to interact with our customer and get more insights about how they're liking our services, how they're liking our products.
Agent: So by putting these different questions, the different surveys directly within the [PRODUCT-1] of the email, we are making sure that we are gathering new information, centralizing that information in the [PRODUCT-5], and making sure that the experience is very smooth and transparent for the customer.
Agent: He doesn't have to log into a different platform or open another browser directly from the email from the mailbox. He can give us some information about his profile so that we can enrich our database.
Agent: Before I dive into the artificial intelligence, do you have any questions?
EndUser: Just the information is served back into [PRODUCT-6], right?
Agent: Exactly. It goes directly back into [PRODUCT-6] so that then from there you can either [ORG-2] future Content or you can create different branches and different journeys depending on what information he's sharing with you.
Agent: You know, so typically if you send them like some feedback surveys after each of the delivery, it's interesting if the grades are not very high to then be able to do a follow-up maybe with support.
EndUser: Okay. Cool. Just a
Speaker 5: Quick question from my side. So this is called customizing the Content for mail.
Speaker 5: But let's say if you have any other channels, for example, push in app or any custom channels, is it also possible to kind of customize for those channels?
Agent: To customize the [PRODUCT-1] of those directly from the tool.
Speaker 5: Yes.
Agent: Yes, so this is the email builder, but we also have the same type of builder for SMS and for push. I'll show you push and just in [TIME-4]. Thank you. Okay, perfect.
Agent: But so to show you a bit more in detail how we can actually [ORG-10] of the different emails, I'll give that in what we called [FAC-1] selection.
Agent: So the goal of [FAC-1] selection is to make sure that each customer is going to get different emails and personalized content, depending on their behavior and depending on the data that we have for this customer.
Agent: So by digging into a pool of assets, so an asset can be a picture, a banner, a promotion, we'll be able to automatically display the right message to the right customer.
Agent: And so how do we do that?
Agent: So the first thing is that we are going to build a pool of assets. So we'll define what we call an asset class.
Agent: So an asset class, for example, would be a banner at the top of my email, a banner for a specific event in a specific city.
Agent: And within that asset class, so within that specific banner, I'm going to have different variation. So for example, here, for this specific banner, I have 13 different assets. So I have different 14 different version of that specific banner.
Agent: So if I go back, then by configuring the asset attributes, that's how I'm going to be able to identify, okay, within that banner, how am I going to decide who will see what banner?
Agent: So for example, the attributes can be here the activity, the city, the language, but maybe for carrying it could be the type of food, the restaurant, the city, the language where they are ordering from.
Agent: Once I've decided those attributes, then I actually match those attributes with the attributes that I have on the profile of my consumer.
Agent: So that I know that for each banner, for example, which is regarding a specific type of food in [GPE-4], then I will match with the customer who also are in [GPE-4] and who are interested in that specific type of food.
Agent: So by setting up these rules, I'm going to make sure that I'm mapping my consumers attributes with all of my assets, all of my pictures, attributes.
Agent: And then using this matching, the artificial intelligence will automatically decide, okay, what banner do I need to display to which consumer?
Agent: And it will pick from the pool of assets automatically to change the different banners, depending on the consumer and depending on the different communications that I'm sending.
Agent: What I can do is I can influence a little bit the artificial intelligence. So for example, I can decide to put in place exclusion rules.
Agent: So if I take an example for Perim, I can decide that one of the exclusion rules is that I want to make sure that if my consumer is vegetarian, I will never show him a banner or a food chain or food restaurant that is not vegetarian.
Agent: So this is typically the type of rule that I can program based on an attribute that I have about my consumer. What I can also put in place is what we call Fatigue Rule.
Agent: Fatigue Rule is to program the [PRODUCT-4] to make sure that we are not showing the same image to the same customer again and again.
Agent: So I can decide that, for example, each specific asset, so each banner, each picture can only be displayed a maximum of ones, two or three times to a customer.
Agent: And then once it has been displayed more than three times, it cannot be automatically selected in my different emails.
Agent: In case I fall into that situation where the pictures have been displayed too many times per customer, then I have what we call a fallback asset.
Agent: So the fallback asset is a generic version of that banner that will be displayed to any customer who is not matching with the different criteria.
Agent: So that there's never nothing, there's never an empty block, you will be able to decide of a generic version of that specific banner.
Agent: Do you have any questions?
Agent: Does it make sense so far?
Speaker 6: Yeah, I have a quick question.
Speaker 6: So for assets, is there a limit in terms of mapping attributes to each asset?
Speaker 6: And If you wanted to use the same asset in multiple journeys or multiple communications, like, is that possible?
Speaker 6: Like, is that flexible enough for us to basically reuse it?
Agent: Yes. So, what you can do is, so each asset can be assigned to different asset classes, so that it's used in different content.
Agent: And for the limits of attributes for one asset, and I don't have any any information, precise information, I don't have the limit at the top of my head.
Agent: I look into it, but I think you have quite a lot of flexibility in the number of fields that you can put in place.
Agent: And I don't think there's a specific limit, but I'll look into it to make sure that if there's a specific number, I can share it with you.
Speaker 6: Yes, yes, that would be great. Thank you.
Agent: [PERSON-7], there's just a couple of chats or questions in the chat is what I meant to say.
Agent: One way of saying, will we get a notification if we're using the fallback assets often so we can add more relevant ones?
Agent: So I think this is something that you may show when I'm not sure in terms of Content insights and you know the different insights that pop up about the [PRODUCT-1] and things like that.
Agent: I think that is something you're going to show.
Agent: Am I right?
Agent: Yes, and it's something that you have in the performance analytics. You have visibility over which asset is being used the most and in which communication.
Agent: So for one asset class, so for one type of asset, you have performance metrics that will tell you, okay, which one has been used, when it has been used, so that then you can, if the fallback asset is being used a lot, then you have the visibility over when it has been used and why it's used a lot, and you can then edit the different attributes so that it matches with more of the different banners that you uploaded.
Agent: Okay, perfect.
Agent: And I think it was, I hope I'm pronouncing the name okay, it is [PERSON-10] who's asked that question. But if there's a follow-up question, maybe pop that into the chat as well.
Agent: And then when [ORG-10] has said, is it possible to prioritize or filter multiple banners for customers based on attributes?
Speaker 5: Just to add a bit more context on that, so we have newsletters wherein we might do highlighting some of the offers that the customers are eligible for.
Speaker 5: It's possible that there might be 13 different offers, and a particular customer is only level for five of them, and you want to display them in a particular order as maybe cards in emails.
Speaker 5: Is it possible to do that filtering and prioritization based on the customer tools?
Agent: Yes, so for the filtering, it's possible because you can put exclusion rules or you can put must match values to make sure that a customer who is only eligible for certain offers will match with those attributes.
Agent: So that's possible. For [ORG-13], you don't have the possibility to decide in which order you will display the banners.
Agent: But what you can do is you can create attributes to try and influence the way the banners will be displayed.
Agent: So by adding for example, maybe a preference or this kind of fields so that it's taking into evaluation also in the decision.
Speaker 5: Okay, but it can handle multiple banners for sure.
Agent: Yes, and so the way the way it works is if I showed you a bit in more detail.
Agent: So If you look at all of your assets, so this is what we call the asset pool, then you will find all of the different banners, all of the different images that have been uploaded.
Agent: And then for each of the images, you will see the asset class. So that's where there, that's the pool of asset in which it's going to be a part of.
Agent: And then you will see if there's a fallback image for this asset, yes or no, is this asset still available?
Agent: Because also what happens is that, especially with offers and promotions, sometimes they are only valid for certain. range of time.
Agent: And so after a certain amount of time, you can program it so that it's automatically archive d and it's not displayed anymore to the customer after a specific date, for example . Then we can see the tags.
Agent: So the tags are the description of that email. So for example, the color, the type of component on the image, the font, the text, And then you have the different attributes that have been chosen.
Agent: So here I have three attributes. I have activity. So this, for example, the first image is more planning affinity people, the second one training, the third one hiking, and then you have the city.
Agent: So which city is actually this event in so that it's matched with the right customers.
Agent: And same with the language, if there's specific [PRODUCT-1] on the banner that is translated in different languages, then it needs to be displayed to the right customer.
Speaker 5: Okay.
Agent: And then I think [PERSON-13] just had one question [PERSON-13] might be easier if you just want to unmute maybe and ask is that okay.
Speaker 6: Yeah, sorry about that.
Agent: Okay, that works. So it was just a question about timing on [PRODUCT-7].
Agent: So
Agent: This one is specific to app, but I think also potentially maybe in some Cases maybe for email as well, I don't know, but time-based [PRODUCT-1] to say maybe if every time someone opens an app but say like [TIME-5] on a [DATE-10] to show that particular piece of [PRODUCT-1] within the app, I think that could be done more with basic rules more so than necessarily with machine learning though.
Agent: Am I right?
Agent: I'm okay.
Agent: Yes, exactly like I think if it's to display some [PRODUCT-1] within the app That's something that we can set up directly with the push notification builder Where we are able to we're able to program at what specific time we want the pop up to appear in the app and then using Personalization string we are able to adapt what Content is displayed depending on the user
Agent: Ok, so you would say at [TIME-6] on a [DATE-10], I know I want to push an in-app message. And like you said, your dynamic string would decide which of the pieces of [PRODUCT-1] to show in that message.
Agent: Exactly. Perfect.
Agent: Ok, hopefully that answers your question.
Agent: Okay, and so if I take an example with a specific email, so for example, here we can see that banner that is going to be different depending on which customer is actually opening the email depending on their city, on their language and on the activities that they are more, that they are preferred.
Agent: So if I switch to different customers, I can see that automatically, the banner is going to be different and it's speaking from the pool of assets that I've uploaded.
Agent: And it will automatically display something differen t for my different customers .
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Is this, this is using [ORG-13], right?
EndUser: For email dynamic emails.
Agent: So that's not using [ORG-13]. That's something that you can do. You can create a personalization using [ORG-13] script directly within your email.
EndUser: But it is using
Agent: Einstein Content selection. So it's already doing it for you. You don't need to Code it. It uses this interface and it does the matching automatically.
EndUser: And one other. Check, I see you have a litmus here. That's like native integrated.
EndUser: There is no, or is it add-on?
Agent: So it's both, it's natively integrated, but you have to have a litmus license to access the native integration.
EndUser: Do you have something similar as well?
EndUser: Like in box testing core is just, we have to use litmus.
Agent: You have to use litmus if you want to have a proper rendering solution and being emails that would be through litmus.
EndUser: Able to just say the different
Agent: Okay, and the second level of artificial intelligence that we can place in our [PRODUCT-1] is what we call [PERSON-13] Insights.
Agent: The goal of [ORG-16] is to help you test and learn how your different subject lines for your emails are performing.
Agent: And the idea here is very simple, is to have an idea of whether the subject line is performing as average, better than the average or below than the average in terms of engagement.
Agent: So is it helping you have email open, have clicks and have engagement?
Agent: The way you can use it is by analyzing automatically all of the different subject lines that you are going to create for your emails, analyze the performance, but you can also use our performance tester in order to test in advance how your different subject lines are performing.
Agent: And so, for example, here, if I create different version of that subject line, I'm going to create one with an emoji one without emoji. I'll launch a test. Sorry. And it will.
Agent: I think I put something. Let me put different version.
Agent: I'm sorry that I guess that's the issue of the live demo.
Agent: So automatically it will actually give you an idea of whether if that email is performing, if that specific [DATE-10] time is performing better, less than the average, so that then you can decide, okay, which one I need to place on my different emails.
Agent: Does it make sense for you?
EndUser: Yeah, definitely.
Agent: In the way it's going to, sorry.
Agent: The way it's going to analyze it is by using a mix of natural language processing, the history of all of the emails that you have sent, but also an anonymized database of all of the emails that have been sent globally on the Marketing platform.
Agent: So it's billions of emails that are building that algorithm in order to have an idea of what is working and what is not working.
Agent: And then you can evaluate depending on having an exclamation mark, having an emoji, how it's influencing the open, the emotional tone of the email, the words that are within that specific subject line.
Agent: For example, if I put that there's a free something, then it would perform 27, better than the average.
EndUser: I have a question here, actually two questions.
EndUser: The first one is how do you solve the new [ORG-16]?
EndUser: With [ORG-13] 13 issue with the emails because everything is rendered to proxy. So basically you have open rates jump up. And the second thing is we can see this like contest. Content clustering on a broader level.
EndUser: So if I want to look into what overall is great performing for specific segment, I can drill down into that. So for example, this segment has this is like top three type of [PRODUCT-1] or top five content.
EndUser: There is like top referring phrase or whatever. It is like, yeah. OK.
Agent: Yeah, for [DATE-13]. So actually all of the metrics within the Marketing Cloud platform have been adapted and all of the models have been adapted in order to take it to account the actual engagements. So the clicks.
Agent: In a way more heavy way than the opens. So all of the models have been already with the [DATE-13] release have been modified so that the engagement is taking over just open rate.
Agent: As we know that most of the open rates are going to be not relevant anymore, especially on the [ORG-16] platform.
EndUser: Yeah, because that's where I was wondering, optimization or subject line is going to be a bit. But this is screwed to the iOS, which for us is a big chunk.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Yes, so what is still going to work is the analysis of the sentence and then in order to have an idea of the performance, it's not just going to be based on open, it's going to mostly be based on actual clicks and engagement on that email.
Agent: And that's why the goal for, I mean, obviously you're aware of that, but the goal of marketers now is to try and put as many call to action or attractive messages within the email to create.
Agent: Create an engagement, because without that engagement you can't be [PERCENT-2] sure that email was actually open .
Agent: Okay, I think we are almost or it's time if you still have [TIME-7]. I'll I'll show you very quickly how you're going to be able to orchestrate then all of this Content with our journey tool.
Agent: So the idea here of [ORG-8] is to be able to create engagement programs using multiple channels and multiple data source to be able to really customize the experience for each of the different, each of the different clients.
Agent: So typically here, the first thing I would do is to decide, okay, who is going to enter in my welcome program.
Agent: So for example, all of the new people who just downloaded the app or all of the people who just created an account.
Agent: Once I decided who I inject in my journey, then I'm going to be able to decide how do I want to engage with that specific customer.
Agent: And this is where I'm going to be able to see all of my different channels.
Agent: So I have the email, the SMS, the [ORG-14], and all of the communication in-app, so which is the main communication source for you, will be push-notification, the inbox or the in-app messages, which would be those pop-ups that would appear when I'm on a specific page on the app.
Agent: I also have the possibility to connect with my social media platform so that automatically I can retarget a specific customer with banners, ads, Content on social media.
Agent: So for example on [ORG-14], on [PERSON-16], on [ORG-21], making sure that I'm really giving this multi-channel experience for my customer. Next step is building the actual logic of the program and adding another level of artificial intelligence.
Agent: Typically, this is where we could find that [PERSON-4]'s 10-time optimization, that we talked at the beginning of the meeting, that will help make sure that we are sending the right email at the best time for each of the customers.
Agent: We also have our frequency split that will automatically analyze how much emails, how much communications we are sending to each of our customers, and then will help us identify whether they are saturated with Marketing communications or whether they are receiving the right amount or not enough Marketing communication.
Agent: Depending on these levels, we'll be able to then adjust how much more communications we're sending to the different profiles.
Agent: And with the scoring split, we're going to be able to see how engaged they are with [ORG-17] that we are sending them.
Agent: So are they opening the emails?
Agent: Are they kicking on the content?
Agent: And after that, are they going on to the app, spending some time either browsing or actually converting and placing an order?
Agent: The idea, again, is to create different branches, different personas, so that we can address each profile in a custom way.
Agent: Do you have any questions on this?
EndUser: I just have one question. Because we are, at least in terms of a channel, we want to integrate our own channel within the app, basically specific screen on the page reserved for, let's say communication truth theorem.
EndUser: Do you have something like that like that we can create with to API or service?
Agent: So would it be to have some blocks on your app that would be customized
EndUser: Depending on exactly what Content blocks.
Agent: Content blocks. Yes, so, [PERSON-1], I don't know if you want to take that point.
Agent: So in [GPE-5], can you just phrase the question for me again?
Agent: Because you were saying you wanted it to be an Integration into CRM to create these blocks?
Agent: Or did I miss you?
EndUser: No, not create. I want to pass the audience. So basically, I want to add this within the journey step. So. Basically, as of my material, I want to create on a general journey to the customer.
EndUser: If I serve you a [PRODUCT-1] on food to push or email, once you land on the food, I want to show you again a [PRODUCT-1] on the specific tile.
Agent: Okay, okay, so you will you will have already created this empty Content area within the app and you just want us to inject the same piece that would have been seen in the email or the same piece in some other way or through the push
EndUser: That would have been seen up. Yeah, basically some type of way of communicating with the app.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, it sounds possible. I haven't seen it done before. So I would probably have to confirm that one with someone on the product team seems pretty possible.
Agent: And we can definitely influence Content areas with things like the product recommendations and things like that, but making it link to a message they've already seen before and having that bridge between the two I'd have to [PERCENT-2] confirm for it.
EndUser: Okay. Basically. What we want is to self force serve payload to the app. Right, this is what we want.
EndUser: And this payload care, you know, it should go like this is the, this is the person that you see it, this is the [PRODUCT-1] that you see it.
EndUser: This is the, you know, like copy and artwork, for example, or in first case, just the audience, but essentially something like this, because this is for us also a channel.
Agent: Yeah, no, that makes sense. That makes sense. Like I said, I believe it would be possible, but if you I would prefer to be [PERCENT-2] sure. Yeah.
EndUser: So
Agent: I leave that one with me and I'll confirm that one for you. Okay.
Agent: Any other questions there at Anything more you want all guys or anything?
Speaker 5: To be into?
Speaker 5: And I'm very hesitantly asking my last question. So one of the like.
Speaker 5: The challenges that we face with the, those on the [PRODUCT-5] tools that we've been using is the number of ways you can segment a customer base, right?
Speaker 5: So for example, let's say you want to target only customers who have had dominant number of orders on food. So they're dominant food users, but not dominant ideal users.
Speaker 5: And maybe looking at customers who have had one order at least in [DATE-16] [DATE-16]. So these sort of different filters, which kind of gives more flexibility of selecting a particular customer segment.
Speaker 5: It will be great to understand what are the lever s that sales was provided I know that it might not be enough time to cover that but if you have it in some sort of material or maybe you can look at it in a further discussion that will really help .
Agent: Yeah, so I mean, we definitely can like really, really deeply segment, but I'm just not sure if we really have time to go into the segmentation field or just now just I'm seeing that we're kind of [TIME-8] over time at the moment, but we could do another session just on segmentation, just on how we filter into the different audiences.
Agent: And even if you wanted to before that session, we could ask you for a couple of specific examples of ones that you want, and we could show how we build those exact examples for you as well. Okay.
Speaker 5: I like your perfect perfect.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: As I said guys apologies for running a little bit over time, No, no, and questions are great questions are great.
EndUser: But we had a lot of questions.
Agent: And I think like I said, the idea of [DATE-2]'s session was just to hopefully give you enough of a sort of a feel and a taster for how the [PRODUCT-4] layer touches of the Marketing platform.
EndUser: All the different areas
Agent: Hopefully in line with what we covered on our last call, but also just give you food for thought.
Agent: Then from there, you can decide if you do want to drill deeper into different areas, if there's more technical under the hood conversations that we need to have with individual teams or individual people, we can of course arrange that as well.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah. Thank you guys for sharing this. It's really insightful. What we really would want. I know.
EndUser: Because some of the team members were not here [DATE-2] to get this overview to them So we can kind of go over it because there been a lot of information and a lot of useful pieces that I think we need to kind of sit on and Analyze a bit and understand what is there so we can kind of yeah I want to take this with the team and discuss because there have been some great features that we see and And some really useful specifically, the [PRODUCT-1] piece, that's really a
EndUser: Robust solution that you have.
EndUser: The only thing I'm worried about, again, but when I look at me, I wonder what is the cost of such a service?
EndUser: And I know this is a separate one. And if this is also can be connected to a different solution, or it has to come with the part of a Marketing cloud.
EndUser: Because I'm always thinking about the cost because I'm a fierce experience.
Agent: Let's do this book. Let's make sure first that this is the right solution for you and solution you guys are looking for.
EndUser: Make sure that this is the
Agent: And then let's leave the costing and the commercials as like a last step because like this is like who you'll be able to like share with you any commercials first off validate this is the right thing for you.
EndUser: Now. But let's
Agent: How we're gonna implement it, how to be integrated with your systems, what kind of other systems you want to connect to it, and make sure that everything is covered, [PERCENT-2] good to go, and then we can take it to the commercial piece after.
EndUser: Okay, so in terms of like timeline, so we can get kind of a, because I want to wrap my head around, okay, because what solutions I already know and this new solution that you already went through [DATE-2].
EndUser: So we can kind of put the robust feature that we would ideally want.
EndUser: And then to, you know, see how do we go about implementation, What is the effort coming from you?
EndUser: What is the effort coming from the supporting teams as to the external agencies?
EndUser: And then we can understand the cost and then we can think if we cannot afford it, where do we go from there, right?
EndUser: This is what I want to understand actually.
Agent: Yeah, exactly. So here's the thing. What I would recommend that first of let us share with you the recording, use it with the team internally, walk them through that.
Agent: If you have any questions, we can have another session for the questions to deep drive in the points that we have discussed [DATE-2] and make sure that this is covered.
Agent: Once we have discovered, we can start, you know, like discussing the next steps, which is will be okay.
Agent: How we're going to implement the solution?
Agent: With what systems we need to integrate with, And then we can introduce you to a couple of partners.
Agent: We know already that there is a partner working on the [PRODUCT-5] piece, but like we need to check if they have the certifications that help them to, you know, to implement such a solution.
Agent: So then we introduce you to a couple of different partners.
Agent: You understand from them, like how they are going to get the job done, what is the timeline and everything?
Agent: And then like we take it to the next step. So let's take it step by step. First off, the most important piece for us is to make sure that we are positioning the right solution.
Agent: Then how we're going to implement this and then how we're going to make it happen for you guys financially.
EndUser: Okay, cool. Yeah, I just want to visualize, you know, like we could go pretty fast with the steps from our standpoint.
EndUser: Okay, you know, so I just want to make sure that like, we, some specific set of time that we can go through it even like faster from our side, because if we do need to make some decisions and changes, this has to happen soon, you know, because this is a robust shift.
EndUser: And the biggest issues, engineering effort, platform cost.
EndUser: Yeah, so yeah, that's the biggest thing I'm worried about to understand like what is the real cause I've seen before when I'm working on implementing the software, she took a bit of time, but I think we can go definitely go faster.
EndUser: Then what I've seen before. And yeah, I just want to understand that piece as well. Sure.
Agent: See how long it will take to implement it will depends on like the Implementation partner capacity Okay, and also the resources looking for the project.
EndUser: That you guys are it's very Yeah, it's a collection.
Agent: So
EndUser: I just need to know like, you know What could be the effort required because then our team needs to assess and then scope it see how many people we
Agent: Need to Here's the thing. Let's do this. OK. Let's schedule a quick feedback session with you and the team if you would like to invite anyone from the team who did enjoy it before. Please do so.
Agent: First off, share it with them, the Recording from [DATE-2], like me, the attorney with the team. And then we can go over this feedback session.
Agent: We make sure that we cover anything, any questions that might have not been answered that you guys have.
EndUser: Or any new questions
Agent: And then agree what would be the next step look like.
EndUser: Okay, shall
Agent: We start introducing partners need another deep dive session
EndUser: And take it. Perfect. Okay, feel
Agent: I will send you some options for [DATE-13]. Okay. When which one will work the best for you and the rest of the team and then we can go over access. Right.
EndUser: Perfect. Deal.
Agent: Thank you so much for your time.
Speaker 7: What can the rest of the team we
Agent: Know that we took like almost for time and extra but really appreciate this interactive session. It's really nice.
EndUser: Bye bye.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. Cost of the service: The customer expressed concern about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the financial implications before proceeding further.
2. Integration and implementation: The customer was interested in knowing the timeline, effort, and resources required for implementing the solution and integrating it with their existing systems. They also wanted to know how the new solution would work alongside their existing solutions.
3. Segmentation and filtering: The customer wanted to understand the capabilities of the product in terms of segmenting and filtering their customer base, specifically in targeting customers who have had a dominant number of orders on food but not on rides.
4. Personalization and customization: The customer was interested in understanding how the product could help them personalize and customize their communications across different channels, including their own in-app channel.

It is important to note that the customer had several questions and concerns, and these were some of the main ones that were discussed during the call.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question about how the AI decides, learns about customer preference communication and channel, like time of day, and can it be tailored for specific services or groups to be one (timestamp 00:22:15). The customer showed interest and asked a follow-up question, indicating engagement.
2. Question about the local customization and the level of parameters that can be adjusted (timestamp 00:26:30). The customer asked for more details, showing engagement.
3. Question about how the personalization works, specifically how to define the criteria of campaign success and optimize it (timestamp 00:34:15). The customer asked for a demo interface to play around with and get more specific in their questions, indicating engagement.

These questions seemed to engage the customer more based on their follow-up questions and requests for more information.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep mentioned that the company, ORG-1, is a platform that allows for the building of different communication strategies across various business areas. However, they did not explicitly mention how this platform can benefit the customer's organization or improve their customer experience.

2. When discussing the Marketing area of the Salesforce Customer 360 platform, the sales rep listed various artificial intelligence functionalities, but did not clearly connect them to the customer's specific needs or pain points.

3. During the demo component, the sales rep showcased various features such as personalization recipes and personalization decisions, but could have better explained how these features would directly impact the customer's business objectives and KPIs.

4. The sales rep mentioned the ability to define criteria for campaign success and optimize accordingly, but did not provide concrete examples of how this could be done or how it would benefit the customer.

5. When discussing the cost of the service, the sales rep suggested focusing on validating the solution first and then addressing cost later. While this approach can be useful in some cases, it might have been more beneficial to provide at least a general idea of the pricing structure to help the customer understand the financial implications of implementing the solution.

In general, the sales rep could have done a better job of connecting the features and capabilities of the product to the customer's specific needs and goals. By providing more concrete examples and use cases, the sales rep could have more effectively demonstrated the value of the product and how it can positively impact the customer's business.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They found the presentation insightful and saw great features in the seller's product. However, they expressed concern about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the implementation effort, timeline, and financial aspects before making a decision. They agreed to have a feedback session with the seller's team to discuss any unanswered questions and agree on the next steps.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: It is unclear from the transcript if the right decision maker was present on the call. The sales representative mentions the need to share the recording and information with the customer's team, which suggests that more than one person would be involved in the decision-making process. However, no specific decision maker is mentioned by name.

As for the agreed-upon next steps, the sales representative suggests scheduling a feedback session with the customer and their team to answer any remaining questions and discuss the next steps. The sales representative also mentions introducing the customer to partners for implementation and discussing the financial aspects of the deal. However, specific dates or timelines for these next steps are not mentioned in the transcript.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and demonstrating the capabilities of their product. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's use case for the product, such as the specific types of content they plan to create and how they will measure the success of their campaigns. This would have allowed the sales rep to tailor the demo to the customer's needs and provide more specific examples of how the product can help the customer achieve their goals.
2. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current marketing technology stack and how they plan to integrate the new product with their existing tools. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's technical requirements and provide recommendations for how to best implement the product.
3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's budget and timeline for implementing the new product. This would have allowed the sales rep to provide more accurate pricing information and set realistic expectations for the implementation process.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs, but could have benefited from asking more targeted questions to gather more specific information about the customer's use case, technical requirements, and budget.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the seller's product's personalization features, specifically the real-time personalized recommendations based on behavior tracking and affinity modeling. They also showed interest in the contextual bandit algorithm used for offer optimization, which balances customer and business value. The customer mentioned that these features align well with their use case of optimizing the right time for specific services. They also appreciated the robust solution for managing and organizing content into a searchable library.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer seemed to be interested in the seller's product and found many features useful for their needs. However, they also expressed concerns about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the implementation process, timeline, and associated efforts. They requested a follow-up meeting to discuss these concerns and ask further questions. Therefore, while the customer is positively inclined towards the product, they have not yet made a definitive decision about whether the product fully meets their needs.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""But I wanted to kind of drill into a couple of areas that based on our conversation, the last time we really think will be beneficial for [PERSON-6] and will help you kind of move forward and increase your customer engagement.""
2. ""So the first one is personalization recipes. So this is basically making sure that we are recommending the best product, the best content, the best categories of restaurants, of food that people can go ahead and engage with.""
3. ""I just have a question more. How does AI decide, learns about customer, preference communication and channel, like time of [DATE-5], can I be tailored specific service or group to be one and like, what is the basic flexibility of adjusting the model?""
4. ""So you have the ability to engineer to feature engineer the algorithm that runs those personalization decisions for next best off for next best action.""
5. ""So, like I said, there are There is the ability for you to engineer to feature engineer the algorithm that runs those personalization decisions for next best off for next best action.""

24. ""So, like I said, there",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. Cost of the service: The customer expressed concern about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the financial aspect before committing to the solution.
2. Integration and implementation timeline: The customer was interested in knowing the timeline for implementation and the resources required from both their side and the implementation partner. They wanted to assess the engineering effort and platform cost to ensure it fits into their plans.
3. Segmentation capabilities: The customer inquired about the segmentation features and how they can filter customers based on specific criteria, such as order frequency and product preferences. They requested a separate session to discuss segmentation in detail.

Answer to this question is clear."
video_19793_167_6qr3y000000odhiAAA,"Agent: So it's recording. So it's another question. So yeah, I was saying, please feel free to interact and engage if you have any question. We have like [TIME-1] left, more or less.
Agent: So [PERSON-1] will do [TIME-2] of demo and then we'll hand it over to the [ORG-1] team. So [PERSON-1], I'll let you start. Perfect.
Agent: Thank you [PERSON-2] and thank you team. So like [PERSON-2] said, we're going to go through the demo before starting. I just wanted to reiterate what we've heard from you so far.
Agent: Obviously, we've had several conversations with [PERSON-3] and [GPE-1] over [DATE-1] I want to say now. And we read your requirements and the white paper that you shared.
Agent: So I just wanted to summarize what we understood from you because from understanding it's going to be the ace of the demo .
Agent: So, starting off was we need [QUANTITY-1] view as single source of truth of the member profile.
Agent: So, all the data that we've captured of the members, whether they are [ORG-2], [ORG-3], we want to have in one system, we don't want to find data in different places, and the profile needs to have structured and unstructured data.
Agent: Following that is how can we better communicate with the members?
Agent: They need to have access to what we have defined a member portal to improve the communication between the members and the [ORG-4], especially for the members department. So that is something that we're also going to see.
Agent: What the experience of the members is going to be like. All of this is going to be translated into a better and improved member in athlete experience and service.
Agent: If our members or athletes log into their portal and they have, they have a way, they need to communicate with us in some type of way, we need to enable them, first of all, to self-serve, but also to communicate with us.
Agent: So that communication is going to be translated into what we call insults first terms a case, they will then be routed to the appropriate teams .
Agent: Why are we doing this?
Agent: This is because we want to digitize the way that we do things currently at the [ORG-4] for the members department and we want to move away from traditional email-based processes.
Agent: So also we're going to see how we can implement and automate some of the Workflow processes within the system. And this is obviously, this is all why we're doing this. We want to automate.
Agent: So the keyword is going to be automating the processes. I'm gonna pause you for just a moment.
Agent: Are we on the Is that what you, did we understand you correctly?
Speaker 4: Same page, everybody?
Agent: Yes. Absolutely. Great, love it. So all of the everything that you are looking at the screen is going to be translated into the demo that we have prepared to you for you [DATE-2]. So.
Agent: Obviously, we are in the [EVENT-1] and Paralympic movement, but we wanted to put a tech gist into the story that we're going to tell [DATE-2]. So let's see how can we move away from tech barriers with [ORG-5].
Agent: At [ORG-5], we love to tell stories. I don't normally love to show you feature and function. So what [ORG-5] can do, obviously, we're going to go and I'm going to highlight you.
Agent: What are the benefits of the value that you will get from it?
Agent: But I wanted to frame it in a story way. So we're going to see the experience [DATE-3] of two completely fictitious characters, one from an internal. perspective.
Agent: So from the [ORG-4], we're going to be looking at the experience of [PERSON-4] using [WORK_OF_ART-1] e as a membership manager internally at the [ORG-4]. And also we're going to be looking at an externa l user.
Agent: So somebody that works at the [ORG-6], obviously I'm [NORP-1].
Agent: So I wanted to use an [NORP-1] [ORG-6] [ORG-7], and [PERSON-5] in this case is going to be the person tha t wants to apply to a grant that the [ORG-4] provides to the different [ORG-8] s. So, let's jump into the journey.
Agent: So I'm going to highlight now on this next screen all the points and all the experience that we're going to be looking at. So first of all, we're going to start with [PERSON-4].
Agent: She starts her day in [ORG-5] and we're going to see what she does and what are the information that she has access to when she logs into [ORG-5].
Agent: We're going to see how she can look at the different grants that the [ORG-4] provides, what is the status of the grants, what kind of programs are related to this grant.
Agent: And then we're going to move over to the external user, so it is a [PERSON-6] that works at [ORG-7] and finds out about an [ORG-4] grant that she wants to apply to.
Agent: So right here, she's going to have access to a grantee or a member portal where she can apply to grants, she can self-service, she can communicate with us internally at [ORG-9], so we'll see her experience as well.
Agent: Moving over to, she can then apply to a new application that will be fired off from the portal.
Agent: And then how can we at the [ORG-4] receive this application?
Agent: So again, moving away from email-based communication, we can see how all of this is then being captured in the single source of truth of the member profile.
Agent: So all of the information that we captured around our members are going to be stored in [ORG-5].
Agent: How can we communicate better with our members?
Agent: I'm going to show you two different options that you have with [ORG-5]. It doesn't mean that you have to choose just one.
Agent: You can use the sky's limits and you can decide and your department will actually decide what way they want to communicate with your members, what channels, what way. So I'm going to show you that.
Agent: Then I'm going to go through a very high touch process. Because obviously, I don't fully know how the grant process at the [ORG-4] works.
Agent: So I'm going to show you what those first can do, but it could be [PERCENT-1] adaptable to your processes. We can see how then the grant is being awarded to [ORG-7].
Agent: I'm giving it out like that. Obviously, it's going to be awarded. And then we're going to see what is going to happen to the post award.
Agent: What is the type of communication?
Agent: What is the type of experience that we want to give our members and attorneys?
Agent: So this is just a summary of what of the story that it's going to be about.
Agent: Any questions so far?
Agent: And obviously, team, I'd love to keep it interactive. If you have questions, I see you. So raise your hand. Just come off mute.
Speaker 4: Do whatever you feel.
Agent: I think you have no questions so far. We're so weird. Great. excited on how this would work. Perfect. Sounds good. Sounds good. So let me introduce again to [PERSON-4], who manages all the membership relationship BI PC.
Agent: Obviously, we have somebody in the call that fits within this role. Let's see how her experience now looks like in [ORG-5].
Agent: How are you day looks like in [ORG-5]?
Agent: So. [PERSON-4] logs into [ORG-5] and this is pretty much a potential view of what she could view what her day could look like. She logs in and she has access to a home page.
Agent: This home page is completely customizable to the needs that [PERSON-4] has in comparison to her role. She manages all the membership relationship so she wants to have those KPIs right when she logs into [ORG-5].
Agent: We love sayings are not worth it . She wants to maybe have this ability to over the grants and the application that she has received [DATE-2].
Agent: How many people are we helping?
Agent: How many are word disbursements, how we had along [DATE-4]?
Agent: This is again just an example of what could be visible for [PERSON-4] as somebody that manages the relationships and the members with the different members. The dashboard is made up of illustrative
Agent: Way of short reports that we have. already created within [ORG-5]. It can be completely customizable to whatever means that [GPE-2] has. What I also had in here are the different [ORG-8] grants.
Agent: So this is something that [ORG-5] has within the system. You don't have to create new and different objects with [ORG-5]. You already have the object that defines the grants, for example.
Agent: What we also have is something that we call the task management. Obviously, when I log into [ORG-5], I don't want to go through my agenda. I want to have the system that tells me what to do.
Agent: Maybe I have tasks that have been assigned to me. Again, we have the automation in place because they could be automatically assigned if a process is fired up in the background.
Agent: I have a task right here that tells me to check on the application process. process for a specific member .
Agent: What I also have because with [ORG-5], I have the ability to log and connect either my Outlook calendar or my [ORG-10] calendar, I have all of the events, all the meetings already in [ORG-5].
Agent: So that I know I don't have to go through a different screen. When I log into [ORG-5], I know that at [TIME-3] I have a [ORG-5] demo and I have to block my agenda.
Agent: So again, team, this is completely customizable view. It's my idea of what I think that the somebody that works in the membership department idea you see would need.
Agent: But again, obviously we can sit down and... change this, whatever, however you want, you can change the logo, you can change the colors, literally anything that you're looking at can be changed and customizable to your.
Speaker 4: As long as I think that the criteria is and the [ORG-8] is defined, exactly that from our end as well that needs to be defined what we want to measure and.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So
Speaker 4: I guess you're not linking them to what specific data is linked to all of them.
Agent: Exactly, exactly. Yes. And it depends like it could be data that you have with instance-first data that communicate to [ORG-5]. So you may be bringing this data outside from external sources into [ORG-5].
Agent: You can create reports in dashboard, obviously with the KPIs that you have defined. And that could be defined according to the person that logs in.
Agent: So maybe somebody- In another department doesn't need to look or have visibility over membership data or applications or grants And that person, because it's not in the membership department, will not have visibility over that .
Agent: So we can have the flexibility of who sees what.
Speaker 4: Just to build on that last point, because that was actually a question on who sees what, from the membership departments, we have colleagues dealing with the branch Engagement is more about the relation, so the governance issues, cases, questions, institutional matters that arise.
Agent: Specifically.
Speaker 4: And this will be definitely different than We live in membership First of all, as far as from what I understand, we can change it as we can.
Agent: Team. Absolutely.
Agent: Absolutely [PERCENT-1] we can be so flexible we can go so deep into the little fields the fields could be like the general population like all the little wording that you see we can be as flexible and as peculiar as you would like to decide that person sees that field that person does not have to see that field so if we're talking about different departments and what they do we can [PERCENT-1] customize the their experience with that
Speaker 4: In mind Last question is that in the back end or can the user do that as well ?
Agent: Great question. So what we suggest obviously if you on board [ORG-5] you're going to have one or more admins. So there is an administrator that would usually it sits within the IT department.
Agent: You can have somebody that you can have the admin to do that or if you as somebody internal as a user, you are.
Agent: Assigned those rights to change the different fields and the visibility, you can do that Obviously, this depends on the experience that the [ORG-4] wants to provide to the differen t users So [ORG-15] has that flexibility, so it really depends on what you would like .
Agent: For something more, you know, that would sit more in the back end, we would probably suggest that there is an admin that defines those rights because we don't want somebody, for example, a membership manager, for example, to delete.
Agent: [PERSON-7] to be able to delete fields by mistake, for example. So we would like to maybe lower that risk by not giving that person delete to access. I'm just, you know, making it, making this up.
Agent: So it really depends, but you can, if you assigned, you can [PERCENT-1] do that right.
Speaker 4: Want to have those rights
Agent: Thanks. Great.
Speaker 5: Perfect. If I may, sure, sure. [PERSON-8] before. So I guess, you already talked about integration of different data sources to visualizations that we see here in the mock-up as well.
Agent: That [PERSON-9] leads
Speaker 5: But then maybe you're going to go into this now as well, but one of my questions is around Workflow application. So my team here in the background also was thinking about what about signatures.
Speaker 5: Because especially when it comes to grants as an example, there's a lot of documents that are being exchanged. So approvals that need to be done internal, but then also moving outside to the client and back.
Speaker 5: So, you know, signature is something that we're interested in, but more or less document exchange. As well, for example, some of the grant programs that we have audit right components in there.
Speaker 5: So as we give out monies, we need to make sure from a [NORP-2] perspective, especially, that the funds that we provide to external third-party organizations are used in a certain way.
Speaker 5: And so there's always this back and forth of applying for a grant. reviewing a budget approving that, then reporting back actuals, requesting documents for proof.
Agent: So it's something, yeah, and I would call a workflow, I guess. And yeah, would like to see how that works. Absolutely.
Speaker 4: I'm [PERCENT-1] going to go through all of that. So in [TIME-4], so we're going to go through it. But thank you for the question I know I support. Sorry [PERSON-1], just a quick question.
Speaker 4: I know that it's going to be customizable and everything can be changed. But by this slide, if we consider the process, the process mapping process,
Agent: Is this the membership profile?
Agent: Is this an example of membership profile?
Speaker 4: My membership
Agent: Profile, you need somebody internal that works Sorry, as a member.
Speaker 4: That manages membership. Yeah. Yeah. So my idea, yes, exactly. So it could be something like that. Because the way that, for example, we as the membership department, once I know it's customers, I just want to make it clear.
Speaker 4: For example, for us, when we say, I think, way of truth is that for example we see NPCs so for example [ORG-8] [GPE-3] all the data from [ORG-15] comes there but you do have one section and the grand has well.
Speaker 4: But, absolutely. Each member, let's say from high F, you have all the information coming from one
Agent: Single source which we call it profile. So this will be that profile. No, this is not a profile. So I'm just showing the experience of the member of somebody that manages the members internally at the [ORG-4].
Agent: We didn't go into the single source of truth of a member, but I'm going to, in [TIME-4], I'm just to show you what are the different functionality that you can have within [ORG-5].
Agent: So this is just the first page that I could look at with all the information, but I didn't go into the details.
Agent: Of let me have a look at the [NORP-1] as a member and wha t they look like but I'm going to in [TIME-5].
Speaker 4: [ORG-10]
Agent: Thank you . Yes, no, thank you for the questions. So before going into the members profile, I want to show you what are the different grants that I have already in [ORG-5].
Agent: In [ORG-5] term, what we defined as grants are called funding opportunities. Again, like I said, anything that you're looking at can be completely changed and customizable to your jargon, to your wording, into your needs.
Agent: What I also had created because the [ORG-4] obviously disbursed this different grant.
Agent: I have created a list of all the funding opportunities But I also created one for, for example, the athlete grants I created one for the only [ORG-13] grants, for example which is going to be the one that we're gonna focus on toda y and the one for the [ORG-13] grants So I have the possibility, thanks to the filters right here to filter and create different list s of the different grants that the [ORG-13] disperses .
Agent: If I go into the [ORG-8] grant and again team completely made up, name is something that I looked at. I think I saw an article around this grant.
Agent: For the organizational developing grant, I want to show you what is again that single source of truth of a grant.
Agent: What are all the information that I want to capture around this grant?
Agent: I know that this grant right now is being appointed up at the top right here. I have what I call a past. A path shows me where I'm standing and what is the status of this application.
Agent: Has it been launched?
Agent: Are my receiving submissions?
Agent: Are the applications coming in?
Agent: Are we under the evaluation process?
Agent: This path and all this wording that you see is completely customizable. I made this completely up to what I thought could be different status of a grant process.
Agent: The details, the details doesn't need any explanations are what are the details around this grant and who are we helping?
Agent: Is it what are the eligibility criteria?
Agent: What are the applications instructions that we can define right here?
Agent: This information if we decide to can be surfaced externally to a member's portal and we're going to have a look how that looks like.
Agent: All the applications that I receive before this grant are going to be under the stop, under the application tab. I like emojis, so I added the emojis here. If you don't like it, you don't have to add them.
Agent: This was just my take. The applications that I received are going to be stored here. Any document checklist items, what the [ORG-6] have to provide in order for me to decide.
Agent: Are they in the standing?
Agent: Can I have... awarded this grant to the [ORG-8]. I'm obviously oversimplifying the process, but I want t o show you what is possible.
Agent: So maybe what needs to be done is that the [ORG-8] has to tell me or ha s to send me some type of documents that will say that they are in good standing and I also need t o have financial review of the [ORG-8] .
Agent: Again completely customizable.
Agent: Any awards, have we awarded this grant to an [ORG-8] for example?
Agent: They are going to be showed up here. We can see and I'm going to go into details of what that looks like.
Agent: The analysis, so any report and data that we can pull from the information that we have can be stored here. I can just add because all these pages drag and drop components, there is absolutely no coding required.
Agent: So if I want to add a report that I created, it's going to be showed up here.
Agent: And again, this is an example of what I have here, is the population served for the specific application, which might not necessarily apply to the [ORG-8] world.
Agent: And then where do we store all the files?
Agent: So again, because we need to have structured infrastructure data, you have the possibility to also add files to the specific grant.
Agent: Now, we had a look at what is internally at the [ORG-4], what is their experience without having yet to receive the application.
Agent: I want to show you now, and I'm going quickly, team, because I think I have [TIME-6]. So, but if you have questions, please interrupt me.
Agent: I want to show you also the experience of a grant manager externally that the site. to apply to the grant. So I want to show you their member profile.
Agent: So [PERSON-5] i n this case that works at [ORG-7] thanks to the recen t communication she finds out about an [ORG-4] grant that she wants to apply to.
Agent: S o let's have a look at her experience.
Agent: She is presented with a login screen wher e she can log in and she can create an externa l user profil e. whether we will address and password or she can obviously, if we enable this in turn of the [ORG-18], she can then login and apply and get access to the member's portal with login via [ORG-25], [ORG-25], [ORG-25], whatever else our social media that she uses, we can enable that single sign-on experience as well.
Agent: So this will be the login screen of somebody of a member down one step access to a member portal . When she logs in, this is what she will look like.
Agent: This is created within [ORG-5] and is what we call a member portal. She, let me just make it bigger so you can see what I have up here.
Agent: I have the homepage so that I can see all the information there is. There was absolutely no coding required. It's all drag and drag components to create the sport that we expose externally. We have what is one grant.
Agent: Maybe we want to have a look at the list of recipients of previous [ORG-4] developing grants. Maybe we want to look at a article on how to apply.
Agent: Customised to the [ORG-4] logo theme article and it's really that second layer o f information that you want to give to your members that have login rights . to a number portal.
Agent: Right here, not only can they have access to the grants, they can also self-serve in case they have questions. Maybe they have questions around an application process. Maybe they want to change their username.
Agent: Maybe they want to change their password. Anything that they want to do, we can have a safe place for them to do so.
Agent: Also, what is the kind of communication?
Agent: How can they communicate with us internally?
Agent: I created here is a contact support .
Agent: For?
Agent: Where anything or when they click submit, a case will be automatically created and routed to the exact team. Thanks to routing schemes that we have defined within [ORG-5]. They also have the opportunity to upload files.
Agent: So this is really to build the support of this really, we have to think about what is the kind of experience that we want to give our external users in this case, the members. Here we go.
Agent: I can also have a look of all my cases all the cases that I logged all the communications that I needed to know from the [ORG-4] And when I meet communications is more I'm not talking about newsletter communication I'm talking about I need help kind of thing It's what is the support that I need from the IP C that I can't solve myself .
Agent: If we want to enhance this and maybe have other channels, not only can we have right here a contact to support form where we communicate with [ORG-13], maybe you want to have something quick and easy.
Agent: I don't want to send an email, I don't want to call, but I want to chat with an agent at [ORG-13]. Right here, we can also enable bot.
Agent: So this is something that we can talk about for the future, but please know that you can. and enable different channels, different communication
Speaker 4: [ORG-25] to enhance the experience of your members . I got a question the update of member profile data.
Agent: On
Speaker 4: Is it possible to at least put the Workflow on it before it reflects, let's say I updated the Secretary General's name, it goes into like a review
Agent: Before it reflects process always, and then you should sign up from the membership. this is absolutely what should happen. So when a member logs in and maybe they change something internally, an approval process is actually fired up.
Agent: It's something that we have to enable in the background. It goes through the [ORG-4] and then we check because obviously we don't want because anything that happens profile will be reflected into [ORG-5].
Speaker 4: In the member's
Agent: This is the same thing. So obviously we want to keep the data consistent. and our approval process is [PERCENT-1] the way to go . Great question, [PERSON-3], thank you. Wonderful.
Agent: So we are here because [PERSON-5] wants to apply to a grant. So if I go into my funding opportunity, I have a look at all the funding opportunities that are visible to me.
Agent: The reason why I'm bringing this up is because I am [PERSON-5] and I work at an [ORG-8].
Agent: So maybe what we could enable is that somebody that works at the [ORG-8] would only be able to view, and this is an example, will only be able to view [ORG-8] graphs, for example.
Agent: And this will be defined things to the audiences that we can define within the portal. So you don't have to create 10,000 different portals, one for the athletes, one for the [ORG-2], one for the IFs.
Agent: You can have one portal but define different audiences and their experience will change according to the profile that of the personal log Z. So this is an idea.
Agent: I don't know if you want to go through that route but please know that this is also possible to improve the experience of your members.
Agent: So, it's a [PERSON-6] one-star apply to the [ORG-4] organization, develop a grant, which is the one that we showed before. Here, we're surfacing the information that we have shared before, that I showed you before in [DATE-5].
Agent: And we define what information will be shared in the portal. If there is something that we don't want to show, we hide it [PERCENT-1] we have complete flexibility or what is available to our members externally.
Agent: Right here and again, this is what [PERSON-8] was saying before was, okay, let's think about a Workflow process that we want to enable.
Agent: Right here, for example, I don't want [PERSON-5] to email me her application about sending me all the files and all the documents that I asked her for.
Agent: What I had it here is what we call in [ORG-5] term after. too low. This is a button that we can surface and can be completely customizable. This is somethin g that I created .
Agent: And right here when there's a mele clicks on the apply for this opportunity is going to fire a form of the information that I'm asking her to.
Agent: Maybe she needs to send me a financial report and maybe she has to send me some kind of information.
Agent: She has to tell me, how are you going to use this money for?
Agent: What is the budget?
Agent: That you're going to allocate to this project. All of this could be created in this form that is going to be fired from a button.
Agent: I want to show you, since we have some IT members in the team, I want to show you how this process in the backend looks like. This is a flow in [ORG-5] terms.
Agent: We can define some categories of who is this person.
Agent: Do we know is this somebody that is open?
Agent: To our member portal or is it somebody that is no t authenticated so we might know information about this person . So we can have different paths and define the criteria that this person falls into.
Agent: Since we know it's a better lab, we have created a, I call it an eligibility quiz, team, this is completely made up. Obviously, you can have it as rich as you would like.
Agent: We can define criteria, and we can thank you for your interest in this particular funding opportunity in this grant.
Agent: We can have... All sets of criteria that we define in this flow So this is what it's going to look like in the back end But then obviously, her experience is going to be extremely smooth because she doesn't have to call us She doesn't have to send us email All the information will be shared through the Member [ORG-25] .
Agent: Great. So she goes into apply and all the applications are going to be stored right here in the application tab.
Agent: If there has been any awards that she has at the [NORP-1] parliamentary committee has been awarded to, they are going to be stored here. This is just an example. We can surface more information that we want.
Agent: Any library content, any article that we want to put in the application tab. for our specific members, we can [PERCENT-1] do so This is obviously just an example I want to pause it right here for two .
Agent: [TIME-7] to see if there are any questions and what you think of the member's experience on
Speaker 4: The portal.
Speaker 5: I'd like
Agent: To ask you to go first and then.
Speaker 4: I have one as well. And if anything. Yeah, we don't have any questions from the room. And definitely there's a lot more opportunity again, expanding all of the services. Again, it will be based from how we define,
Agent: You know, expanding applications in the future. Absolutely,
Speaker 4: Yeah. This is obviously just an example.
Speaker 4: Probably a question, rather, two questions or details, but is the look in the field, is it all standardized for all members?
Speaker 4: So, whether it's an [ORG-8] IF, [ORG-8] if you remember why the information is easy for [GPE-4], we'll see the same.
Speaker 4: For example, the picture was that even do you have that flexibility to customize to that extent as well?
Speaker 4: But again, that's really detailed. We will look at the field that just came out.
Speaker 4: And the second question you mention there's a chat function?
Agent: Is, did
Speaker 4: Did I get that right?
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Speaker 4: So is that a chat function activity to go to individual people depending on who is chatting?
Speaker 4: So let's say I'm running from [ORG-8] member from [LOC-1], it is jobs that it is going to assign the
Agent: Asset manager or regional lead in our team. Right. Let me any other comments.
Agent: No, okay. So let me answer the first question. So the experience can [PERCENT-1] change according to the person that logs in. So we talked before around the different audiences.
Agent: So if you decide that you want to give a member in [LOC-2], for example, a completely different experience. The page needs to look different. The article needs to look different. You can [PERCENT-1] have that flexibility.
Agent: So you're not tied to one view. We've created one portal and it to be the same for everybody.
Agent: If this is not what you want, you can [PERCENT-1] have that [PERSON-10] y because it is embedded within the portal functionality and it's called audience The second question, so the chat functionality, can you rephrase the question?
Agent: So obviously this could be, you can decide to either surface the chat functionality , for, you know, it can be for a X amount of members or it can be for people that have this category.
Agent: So depending on the audience, once you have the chat, either you can have a chat button before routing it to the agent, or you can have, obviously, there is going to be an agent on the other side.
Agent: I'm calling it an agent. You might not call it this way.
Agent: You might have an agent that is a... for that specific theme and category, and they're gonna be able to apply, to reply, because here we have the routing as well defined as a workflow.
Agent: If it's somebody after membership, obviously
Speaker 4: That looks we don't want to route to the chat to somebody in another department that might not know what they talk about. You guys.
Speaker 4: So basically the option is one chat bot if we create the chat bot there so that there will be some certain questions there use or if every weekend actually have like service levels there let's say first will be chat bot and then do you want to talk about it then in the very big
Agent: That goes into like a live queue who will who will answer it or we can just totally disable to.
Speaker 4: It if we want
Agent: Absolutely, absolutely. You don't need to have it. This is an example.
Agent: You absolutely need to have a chat if you don't need to have a chat, but if it's not all you want, I just want to show you the possibilities. Yeah, [PERCENT-1].
Agent: Sure. Now, let's have a look at the members profile. This is what we're here for. And let's have a look at what's all the information that we've captured around our member as an [ORG-8], [ORG-7].
Agent: So what we're looking at, I'm now [PERSON-4] again. I work at the [ORG-4] and I'm logged into sales first. So I want to have visibility over [ORG-7] as an account as a member.
Agent: Some of the information that I added that were obviously not other the box, but I wante d to show you what is possible For example, do we know that this [ORG-8] is in good standing Yes, we do Obviously, this is not a field that fills first comes out of the box .
Agent: This is something that I created and it's extremely simple to create. You create it and you attach it to this page. All Dragon Drop components, absolutely no coding whatsoever, require, I have no idea how to code.
Agent: Any information that you want to surface up at the top of the information that I want to know more.
Agent: Are they in good standing?
Agent: Are they in ground to your organization?
Agent: What is the website?
Agent: What is the flag in the country that we are talking about?
Agent: I want to also show the membership status. So right here, I know that they're an active member. Obviously, if they were inactive, they will be flagged as inactive. And maybe the kind of information will be different.
Agent: Maybe they're suspended, maybe they're terminated. Obviously, this field can be completely customizable. This is something that I added.
Agent: Any details of the information?
Agent: What is the main contact?
Agent: This is an actual main contact at [ORG-7]. So I created [DATE-6], I know that this might be the person that I have a relationship with.
Agent: Maybe this is the person that I know the most internally at [ORG-7]. Example. Membership information already in the standing.
Agent: What is the membership type?
Agent: But this is a pick field that I created so that I know and I can this is great for reporting for creating lists.
Agent: So I know how many NPCs am I helping?
Agent: How many NPCs applications have I received anything like that?
Agent: This is something that I can that I can obviously customize. The address information that I have here. All of this can be completely customizable to whatever relationships.
Agent: Since we're talking about a relationship manager here when we're talking about membership I want to know who works at the [ORG-4] that I have a relationship with. So I have obviousl y our [PERSON-5], who is the grant manager.
Agent: I have [PERSON-8], who is the president, an d then I have [PERSON-15], who is my main contact to add the internationa l [ORG-25]. They are a link to two different relationships.
Agent: So I know she's the head of committee who is the grant officer and who is the president of [ORG-7]. So this also helps me to See who I need to contact with.
Agent: Any membership fees are there.
Agent: So right here, what are they paid their membership fee?
Agent: They're going to be stored in the membership profile.
Agent: What are the previous or future or applications that haven't been submitted or awarded yet?
Agent: They are going to be sure that up here. So for example, during COVID, they applied to a grant at the [ORG-8] and had us been approved and also awarded.
Agent: So we can see the link between an application and a word, right?
Agent: Here obviously I made some testing . I can have an application that I just recently submitted. And if there has been a word that has been granted, I can do that as well.
Agent: I just want to show the application record because obviously it's not what [PERSON-8] was saying. We have to involve other people. It's not just me and you that deal with a membership application.
Agent: There's going to be external approvals, internal approvals. So.
Agent: And right here I can submit to the application for approval So this has been again, a Workflow automation that we have had it With a click of a button, I don't have to do anything else It's not that I have to call somebody in my team to apply for this, to review this application I can just fire this button and it's going to .
Agent: It's going to notify the person that has to review the application. All of this will be stored in the approval history so I can view whether or not what are the reviews and what has been the application recommendation.
Agent: Okay, this has been awarded.
Agent: What are the application decisions?
Agent: So this is going to be obviously many different people and keeping it extremely short for the time but this is really where you would have the difference the community.
Agent: With different teams and you can fire this through Workflow automation . All of this can be audited because I have an application history so I can know who's reviewed it, who's changed it.
Agent: If there's made any amendments, all of this will be tracked. So if there's been a mistake or maybe we have to go back a few steps previously, all of this will be stored in the history. Great.
Agent: If I go into the funding award, so let's assume a fast forward from now, we have awarded this grant to [ORG-7].
Agent: What can I do?
Agent: Within [ORG-5], I can create an award letter right here. So this is something that [PERSON-8] was mentioning before in terms of signature.
Agent: Right here, we can create a, this is obviously just an example of a letter that we can create within [ORG-5] if we need to add what's If we need to add e-signature, obviously we'll be looking at what we call [ORG-25] e of the vendors, the [ORG-25] that integrate with salesperson like [ORG-26] or [ORG-30] This is something that we can discuss Any budget that has been allocated So for example, our here K-10,000 dollars are going to be used for communication, material s and publications This is what [ORG-25] has told me to What are the disparities [DATE-7] So I'm looking at the finance department right here This is what we're doing where you would definitely look up and where you would [PERSON-15] If you want to, if we need to integrate your finance syst em or your accounting system with [WORK_OF_ART-1] e, [ORG-5] has an open [ORG-25] I, so information can flow in and out of [WORK_OF_ART-1] e. any requirements.
Agent: I'm going very fast. Maybe [ORG-7] has to send me a financial report for me to disperse different funds. So all these requirements can be linked to a disbursement.
Agent: So before I receive the financial report, that money cannot be mobilized. This is all something that comes out of the box.
Agent: I'm not familiar with the actual grants and application process at the [ORG-4], but hopefully this has given you an idea of what could be possible in [ORG-5].
Agent: And obviously this is a system that can be completely customizable to your needs. I'm just showing you what is out of the box.
Speaker 4: Any questions so far before we move to [ORG-1], because I want to give them enough time. Just a quick this platform can be presented in terms of the dashboard question.
Agent: So
Agent: In the first place, right?
Agent: For example, if you want how many members are we put in sand?
Agent: It's shown in, for example, number of the members. Absolutely. Absolutely. [PERCENT-1] any data that you have within [ORG-5], you can create reports and you can create the dashboard on. So it is [PERCENT-1] possible.
Agent: What I have right here at the beginning is just an example. You can create this many
Speaker 4: Dashboards and reports that you want
Speaker 5: That could be invisible to either you, your team, to everybody else you.
Agent: Or only [ORG-33]. Thank you.
Speaker 5: I guess exporting data as well, [PRODUCT-1] and stuff like that is, of course, something that comes with it as well. Absolutely. In fourth and export. Perfect. And I have two more questions.
Speaker 5: You've shown the Workflow that sits behind, let's say one of these opportunities or grant programs as we call them as well, where from an [ORG-8] side. going through the application process, you would need to provide certain information.
Speaker 5: And that's opportunity specific data.
Speaker 5: But then as we saw in the [ORG-8] or member profile page, there may be also a data component where an [ORG-8] has more general information as address name, and then maybe even finance relevant information, like bank account information, that then is applicable or true, I guess, for all grant programs, meaning, you know, what's the bank account that you'll receive the funds through, it doesn't matter what the opportunity is.
Speaker 5: And so I wonder if the Workflow or the system does differentiate between these two types of data and how then And just to avoid have to provide the same information twice Versus it polling it from certain areas where this has been that somebody doesn't
Agent: Previously provided I'll pause here, and then I have a second question Yes, so long story short, the system will do whatever you tell it to do.
Agent: So if you want to pull that data that has been provided somewhere else, obviously where does the data fit?
Agent: Usually it should say to the members profile.
Agent: So if they've already provided a bank account, obviously, when we're talking about banks, when we're talking about bank accounts, this is extremely secure information that we might not want to surface to everybody. So maybe only the finance department.
Agent: Needs to have at the bank .
Speaker 5: A look
Agent: Information or the bank number that they provided. So that is something that [PERCENT-1] we can do. The Workflow was just an example, but you can massage it and customize it and create new ones.
Agent: I have so many created that will fire according to
Speaker 5: Whatever you want it to do. So you have flexibility. And then there's a change process as well in terms of approval. I think you mentioned that as well.
Agent: If somebody changes the bank account, then that needs to be and all of that stuff.
Speaker 5: Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. This is something that you can define. Perfect. And then my last question is around accessibility. I'm not sure if this has been discussed before. I'm just going to ask the question.
Speaker 5: So of course, within our team, but also the NPCs, there may be cases in which somebody is living with a visual or hearing impairment, let's say.
Speaker 5: And so we have a very specific use case here in terms of making sure that information that's being published.
Speaker 5: Has gone through a check and a test basically how this is then viewable or hearable to someone with an impairment as well and then secondly on the end user side on the client side it would be also helpful to understand how there's like a reader function that especially for
Agent: For VI impairments, you whatever is on the screen versus seeing it.
Speaker 4: Can basically hear
Agent: Yes, so, yeah, actually. I agree with the question. Yeah, so this is extremely, extremely important. Thank you for bringing this up. So we go through all the accessibility standards. [ORG-5] does have the WCAG2 Accessibility Initiative standard, obviously.
Agent: This is true all for internal and external users as well. I'm going to send you all the information just because of the time crunch. of what [ORG-5] does and what is the experience for
Speaker 4: The internal users that live with
Agent: Impairments and external users as well So what would be the members experience from a court ?
Agent: Also can this be multiple language as well, right?
EndUser: Yes, [PERCENT-1].
Agent: Please.
EndUser: Pmo pause may be here for a second. Because there are any questions or questions related to that. Sure, I have it. I have no more questions.
EndUser: So establishing a single source of truth for the members, it started like a first step for the organization. So we have all the members in one place. OK, we used to come.
EndUser: A few cases, a few applications that they can submit or things that they can apply for. But this is going to be a constant development. So we will have new ways of engaging with members.
EndUser: For example, we'll have different stakeholders that need to participate in different workflows, such as they say we have a general assembly and we need them to apply for participating in general assembly or we need to invite them.
EndUser: And ask them to submit information about travel or to convey to our membership gathering and stuff.
EndUser: So how does work in case you want to add another Workflow to the system?
EndUser: Is it something that we can kind of customize
Agent: Or we need the help of the partner?
Agent: But I mean, what is the extendability of the opportunity?
Agent: So I think I've read the answer to this would be it depends. So if you have so this is something for the Workflow automation.
Agent: If you want to create approval process is all that this will be included in your licenses. So it's not that you need that, you know, you need to purchase more or something like that.
Agent: So literally in the setup right here you can go in and you can create your Workflow for an approval process for an application process, whatever you want. I think it will depend. the complexity.
Agent: If you are already familiar with [ORG-5], how it works, it would be incredibl y easy. We have drill head modules, drill head is ou r gamified learning platform, free of charge.
Agent: You don't have to be a customer to use it, where you can learn how to use the flows that I was telling you about. So this is something you can have completely autonomy upon.
Agent: I guess maybe for the beginning a partner will create a few workflows to show you and I will give, I think this is the perfect segue
EndUser: For [ORG-1] because I think they will be able to explain this better than myself. Okay.
EndUser: I think you did a little bit of time and I think those are all the questions I have a couple more but maybe we can do
Agent: In another session so yeah thank you very much for them on the presentation.
Speaker 6: Sounds good. Yeah, come on over to you.
Speaker 6: Okay, great. Then we will pick it up from here.
Speaker 6: We will try to keep it as short as possible, but what should be the main message, we are able to deliver, let's say, your vision into reality, right?
Speaker 6: So the we are the partner for translating whatever is possible in salesforce to concrete features for your end users, for your members, for the athletes, maybe at [DATE-8]. So quick look on the agenda.
Speaker 6: Few words on why we think [ORG-1] could be the right partner for you. Also our understanding, which is very similar to what we have heard from [PERSON-1], by the way. So we are quite aligned here.
Speaker 6: Then we will show you our approach to bring this to life potentially. We have a high level solution sketch that's already quite technical. So I'm not needed if we need to build it.
Speaker 6: Detail, but we would also show you a potential project setup and a potential timeline for first [ORG-25], so mini-mill valuable product basically, what could be your first step.
Speaker 6: And we give you a glimpse on some of our tools that could support this Implementation project here as well. And later on I think we will also discuss about the potential indication here.
Speaker 6: So why [ORG-1]?
Speaker 6: I will keep it very short. So first of all, we are already a partner of [ORG-5], but we are already a partner of the [ORG-4] as well and also the [EVENT-1] family on a global level.
Speaker 6: I think we had already several touch points here. Like [PERSON-10] mentioned, we have gained a lot of expertise in the sporting world via the sports business group over [DATE-9].
Speaker 6: I think that is something we can definitely also bring here to the table with fresh ideas from similar companies. But of course, we also can bring our full consulting knowledge from all the other industries.
Speaker 6: And I think that can really, really help us to also foster some efficiency gains and so on to really bring in some fresh air.
Speaker 6: At [DATE-8], it's really, you can be ensured that for each of the project phases, we deliver at the highest possible quality and we are also capable of.
Speaker 6: Scaling because I thin k Your organization point of view, I think, at [DATE-8], one of the limiting factors will be also resources.
Speaker 6: So we are able to scale our project teams to your demand, so that we are not overwhelming you, but nevertheless, still delivering the highest possible quality and inequality. Correct.
Speaker 6: On our approach, just to give you a little bit of better understanding what digital stands for. So we are not a pure Implementation partner. Our services go far beyond. It's from creation of strategies together with you.
Speaker 6: We are creating very, let's say, creativity or creative aspects as well. For example, we are performing marketing campaigns together with clients. We are even designing the complete marketing entry stories for clients. lines and other brands, for example .
Speaker 6: It's the classical process reengineering. So if you would like to touch your finance processes and need some support there, we could also do this. All this we bundled together with, let's say, technology Implementation skills at D-load [ORG-39].
Speaker 6: There's far more I could tell you, but what is maybe important, we try to follow always these three major phases. That's the bottom of it. If we could quickly stay there. Thanks.
Speaker 6: It's always the imagine, the deliver, and the run. So. All our projects follow this approach.
Speaker 6: So in the beginning we try to, let's say, envision the first step, the first product that we would bring life, would create together and bring to life.
Speaker 6: And then next phase we will implement this together with you, together with [ORG-5].
Speaker 6: And then we will bring you to the point where you can bring it live and where you can also run the system because I think that is also very crucial for you.
Speaker 6: You don't want to be always dependent on us, right?
Speaker 6: So it's always one of our major targets to hand you over the steering wheel as soon as possible and that you are also in a position to constantly develop this platform further for the needs and maybe only need our help or other implementation.
Speaker 6: But I hope for more complex things Yep . Then very specific to [ORG-5], I will bring it to the line. We are worldwide the leading [ORG-5] partner. We have certified experts in all regions of the world.
Speaker 6: Customers are very, very happy with us that you can see in the bottom left corner. So customer satisfaction scores are very high. and I think we would have a very similar experience.
Speaker 6: I will give you all this to read after the presentation.
Speaker 7: Let's talk a little bit more about the [PRODUCT-2] and [NORP-3].
Speaker 7: That is where you are coming into place, right?
Speaker 7: Yeah. So we as already presented by [ORG-5] understood, your challenges that we actually want to create the single source of truth with the member portal, also having a streamlined process without a machine to just be more efficient.
Speaker 7: And really want to focus here on the member profile and Workflow management for the first phase.
Speaker 7: So how we deliver it, I will explain you in [TIME-8], but just to also make sure that we are on the same page is really an ambition to create the digital solution strategy, according to your wishes.
Speaker 7: So therefore we will actually start with detailing out and designing a journey for the corresponding member athletes, but also the users of the system. And that should be future-proof.
Speaker 7: And scalable and therefore we really want to deepen the engagement to move away from th e corresponding traditional model which includes a lot of emailing .
Speaker 7: And yeah, with the technology evolving, we can even leverage a lot of processes and automations to create less manual work and have a satisfaction increased on our site.
Speaker 7: And how we are doing that, that's maybe a good point at also coming to the first or one of the points that we mentioned. So of course, we need to have a combined journey.
Speaker 7: So we need to look at what is successful, what's capable of, what are your urgency needs, what are the capabilities of your organization, and from our points of view, we need to start with a minimal viable product.
Speaker 7: So that means that we really take the most critical points, the most useful things that we have and the standard with [ORG-25] profit cloud and directly focus on things that have been shown by [PERSON-1] and even tacklin g your pain points .
Speaker 7: To implement the management. Therefore, we actually have the capability to be really fast because we're focusing on a minimal viable project.
Speaker 7: The good thing is with building that as a basis, we could even in a later time point, when we have empowered you to even use that [ORG-25], modify it yourself. to extensions.
Speaker 7: Then we can even include more integration to other systems automating there.
Speaker 7: And of course, if we actually want to look in the near future, we could even go into very fancy stuff where we could force me like [GPE-5] or [GPE-6] have a real platform where the whole athletes membership can manage everything in one platform.
Speaker 7: But let's focus on the [ORG-25] for that one. So let's have a look on how to realize an [ORG-25] and what are the corresponding faces that young have been mentioned.
Speaker 7: That would mean that we come to the [ORG-25], Deliver, and Run phase. Big focus is actually on the [ORG-25] phase. So you have seen hopefully a lot of things where you are like, ah, this would be useful.
Speaker 7: This is useful. But in the end, we need to detail down what is really bringing the most effort with the least corresponding potential conflicts on other processes.
Speaker 7: So therefore we would actually start with the corresponding process and user design in order to prioritize what we want to deliver.
Speaker 7: So here what is very important we need to have directly changed communication included to make sure that the users are in the end empowered to use the system and even the admins which [PERSON-1] was mentioning if you want to quickly change certain pictures on the corresponding community or even on the home page the new KPI is to develop that you don't need.
Speaker 7: A partner and spend money and yeah that you are unable to realize that one i n this start even in the imagine phase to know okay how do we approach such a topi c If we then have scoped the [ORG-25], we will deliver it with of course an agile framework.
Speaker 7: We even have certain tools that we will use to really use the [DATE-10] development in order to have certain methodologies that hopefully you will get used to already used to resprint planning, corresponding user acceptance and then the corresponding launch of the product.
Speaker 7: The continuous improvement would be then a mix of additional projects that we can combine in the corresponding slide shown before or even when you are empowered to do it yourself. And yeah.
Speaker 7: If there are questions happy if you ask me, I will even just have a briefly talk about the solution sketch. So we have exactly the same opinion what was shown actually by [ORG-5].
Speaker 7: We would leverage the released nonprofit cloud from [ORG-5] to really combine the excellence of sales or even customer relationship or even member relationship. However, we would like to call it with the corresponding service and experience cloud.
Speaker 7: So we can see we have focused on a lot of corresponding components here from your requirements list, but this is still a draft.
Speaker 7: We need to really have a detailed discussion on what would be your highest priority, maybe even something if you say the corresponding feature that was presented by [PERSON-1] with this signature.
Speaker 7: So important and the pain point and right now you are not able to capture the signature, verify it. Then we even would have on the right side some external partners to use them leverage.
Speaker 7: Them to have also that signature from the first graph we would exclude it because thi s is of course an additional license. It's a little bit of integration to include tha t corresponding functionality .
Speaker 7: But of course, that's your pain point we can adjust the corresponding high level architecture.
Speaker 7: And due to the time I will already jump to the project setup, most important thing on the slide is not what is on the right.
Speaker 7: So we will start with a small lean team where we would actually have a project manager, a corresponding technical function, lead and developers. The most important part is on the left side. Let's leverage the collaboration.
Speaker 7: So there are a lot of standards features from [ORG-5] also for the scoping workshop. We can likely look into the demo of what was presented by [PERSON-1]. You have a career.
Speaker 7: Which we would need to know in order to have really the one team approach to work to one goal which would be a great [ORG-25], which might be even a valuable to use already at [GPE-7] or whatever is your timeline and coming to that one even then I would take a look at the next slide .
Speaker 7: Go to the timeline, we are ready. So we have executed certain products and we can leverage the standard at last. So we would invest in beginning of [DATE-8] to do this scoping workshop.
Speaker 7: So really, using our corresponding offices where we have a really free, open-minded possibility to brainstorm and define on the scoping workshop.
Speaker 7: So with that, we can provide you by maybe end of [DATE-8] concrete offer on what would be the cost for the corresponding project, which could potentially Go Live mid of May, of course.
Speaker 7: This is accordingly to all the best scenario that we are able to collaborate and finalize [DATE-15]. But even if we move a little bit, we are still before [DATE-15].
Speaker 7: And if you have the goal to leverage some of the shown features for an event of the [GPE-7]. that would be possible in our opinion because, as mentioned, we are ready.
Speaker 7: Because I'm already over time, I would just give you a quick hand on what tools we have. So, yeah, we have a [ORG-5]-based [ORG-41]-I project management tool, which will actually leverage all the corresponding [ORG-5] features and risk management.
Speaker 7: How do you have a question?
EndUser: Yes, I had a question about the side before this one. So what this means is basically that we need to have this coping workshop first and then we'll be able
Speaker 7: To get it all from you.
Speaker 7: Or maybe you can even take over, but you would be able to get an offer without a scoping workshop, but it would not be super precise or they're a little bit more assumption, if we in comparison if we would do a scoping workshop.
EndUser: And. I think that is still fine. I mean, if you give us an estimation. first and then we'll review the estimation and then we can make it a bit more precise through a spoken workshop.
EndUser: I will say that we appreciate the initial assessment first.
Speaker 6: Yeah, that we can do. So of course that would have then certain underlying, let's say, assumptions.
Speaker 6: And to be honest, we would provide you a range because, yeah, everything else, I think we would really need this scoping workshop for.
Speaker 6: But with that, you could have at least then the feeling of what kind of invest you would need to take it to at least brings something like an [ORG-25] life. I can also understand this.
Speaker 4: We can provide you this during [DATE-10]. And it was still based on the number of sprints that a specific project is done, right, together with the team.
Speaker 4: What if, let's say, for example, if we get a code like minimum team members, let's say we do the project management on our side and we just need like the dead person from your side.
Speaker 4: And then let's say we do the scrum master and everyone else from our side.
Speaker 4: Would that be?
Speaker 4: Or I think, no, sorry, I let me correct myself. I think it is, yeah, we can base it from the minimum spend numbers you have and then that
Speaker 6: Correct, correct. But yeah, of course we could also discuss these topics.
Speaker 6: For now we have really thought about the absolute minimal project team we could offer to really ensure that we are sufficient here to reach the goal I for you, right?
Speaker 6: And of course, step by step, you could then also take over more and more responsibilities,
EndUser: But what you have seen me on the team status, I would say, is the minimal setup. We could start with. As the initial test [DATE-13] would we also
Speaker 6: Get the election this
Agent: Cost from you or. [ORG-5] provides those. We have prepared the only sense of cost.
EndUser: So
Agent: You get as part of the slide and sharing after.
Speaker 7: We can share everything with you out there. Okay. And the rest of the team obviously. So yeah, maybe just to wrap up because that's exactly our last slide.
Speaker 7: So I will, because we already over time, you can have a look at this one. We actually have these, yeah, more or less. [GPE-8] project management tool with a lot of feature which actually becomes your intellectual property afterwards.
Speaker 7: So you have even for other projects, the corresponding project management tool, which is very beneficial.
Speaker 7: And we are actually part of the corresponding national organization committee to have their certain assets developed that can be leveraged about all [EVENT-1] committees. And yeah, that are certain examples. You can have a look in the slide.
Speaker 7: And yeah, the most important part for you would mention those by honest, our really lean team, which we're actually proposing is really what you can see. We have reduced the project management to [DATE-13] over [DATE-18].
Speaker 7: So nearly everything is already included and really completely on the corresponding development side because that would was our approach, which would fit to the corresponding organization and has been similar, I think. realized also with the [ORG-25] team.
Speaker 7: So, yeah, that would be the first comment to your questio n already . And with that, yeah, already. Thank you and time for any additional question.
Speaker 4: Yeah, sorry. I think we missed.
Speaker 4: Maybe it goes back to the question to [ORG-5], the mask communication side, like if it's going to
Agent: Be an outlook or a different method. Well, was there was there something that thing we didn't cover that right. Yes, so for the mass communication, either you do it from the [PRODUCT-3], obviously there are some limitations.
Agent: We didn't go through into the details in very deep requirements, in very deep.
Agent: Or we can go and look at the [ORG-5] automation to [ORG-25] tool that where you have, you can create what we call the different journeys.
Agent: If somebody logs in or somebody signs up to a newsletter, for example, maybe you want to remind members of the company.
Agent: Of something or maybe you want to let them know that there is a new grant that they can apply, this is something that we can look at for the [ORG-25] tool.
Agent: If there is a one-to-one communication then our understanding is either you can do it or you can do it without look and
Speaker 4: From [ORG-5] obviously you can merge the two. We didn't go into the details for lack of time. But we will be positive that for us, if we have members and let's say email addresses from each then we have
Agent: Member in their profile. Yeah, and the same platform can we
Speaker 4: Do a mass communication for example. yeah.
Agent: Okay, thank you.
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: Any other question.
Agent: Another question rather than kind of a summary of what we like to get next. So,
Agent: As we, as we, as you're already aware, we, we have, we've been running a digital transformation program and identify the field those areas which we would like to.
EndUser: Transform through the technology. And the membership engagement and the membership portal is the one that is on top of the monitor. The one who identifies as a priority. So, and we definitely want to work on that one.
EndUser: And we have a significant limitation [DATE-25], which is games, and we have games in between.
EndUser: One major part of our assessment is going to be whether we can already start doing something before the games, and then something which might be usable or which might make sense and won't disrupt the normal game operations, or do we complete this ship based on [DATE-25]?
EndUser: And for us to be able to make that assessment.
EndUser: We already have a critical understanding of the, but at this based on your offer of coordinating days, it's a good understanding of how much effort is required and what could be the time line.
EndUser: We need to look inwards and see what the power effort looks like, how much do you need to be involved in this project. I assume it would be a significant investment from our end as well.
EndUser: Now, for the cost element in it, which has two components. One is the time investment from the lower end, from the lower end, and also the direct sensing.
EndUser: On [DATE-25], I can make an assumption of what that could mean based on the previous projects we've liked. But for the licensing, I'm still a bit certain.
EndUser: So although, so I'm not going to be a runner if you could share with me the license to cost a towards. I'd appreciate if you could go to share with me the licensing cost.
EndUser: For the other entity that we shared with you, which is mass communications for our [PRODUCT-2] team.
EndUser: So it was a more typical theorem, mass communication function, which is not exactly related to the membership management, but it's more, all the B2C function, which is with new letters or fan engagement and stuff like that.
EndUser: So that would really help us understand How much the total investment is going to be both time and material, time and cost, and where we can position this, whether it makes sense to do something in [DATE-25], and still need to make, or whether we'll have to say, okay, of focus
Agent: Is a good type
Speaker 6: Of service. Yeah. Yeah. maybe one comment from my side.
Speaker 6: I think you touched a very important area also if you have the capacity to perform this before, before the games, right?
Speaker 6: So the minimum requirement we from a delivery point of view we would foresee on your side is at least to a small degree of person from your IT team supporting us on a [DATE-25] basis and somebody from the business areas that should use the tool later on.
Speaker 6: So if you ask myself, I would tell maybe [PERCENT-2] minimum of those persons would need to go into this project.
Speaker 6: If you would like to have a chance for a really successful Implementation and also, let's say, having a chance for high user adoption afterwards, because if we involve these people from the business very early, They will be somehow ambassadors for the system later on, hopefully, right?
EndUser: So just from our experience here. Yeah. So this is for the light.
EndUser: Would you mind stating those coordinating days to natural number?
Speaker 6: I mean, I'd like to have it as a fault. Yeah, we will share it also with [DATE-25] raids for the different levels. You will get this and then we will give you a range for the [ORG-25] where you
EndUser: Could range up. Yeah, okay. Very helpful. Thank you.
Agent: Okay, then we will send respectively the information. Are there as you expected and I will post a Recording also and then make sure that we give you access to the recording.
Agent: And then when would you like to reconnect potentially?",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions were aimed at understanding the customer's requirements, pain points, and expectations from the seller's product. Here are some examples:

1. ""I just wanted to reiterate what we've heard from you so far. Obviously, we've had several conversations with [PERSON-3] and [GPE-1] over [DATE-1]. And we read your requirements and the white paper that you shared.""
2. ""So, starting off was we need [QUANTITY-1] view as single source of truth of the member profile.""
3. ""So, all the data that we've captured of the members, whether they are [ORG-2], [ORG-3], we want to have in one system, we don't want to find data in different places, and the profile needs to have structured and unstructured data.""
4. ""Following that is how can we better communicate with the members?""
5. ""They need to have access to what we have defined a member portal to improve the communication between the members and the [ORG-4], especially for the members department.""
6. ""So that communication is going to be translated into what we call insults first terms a case, they will then be routed to the appropriate teams.""
7. ""Why are we doing this?""
8. ""This is because we want to digitize the way that we do things currently at the [ORG-4] for the members department and we want to move away from traditional email-based processes.""
9. ""So also we're going to see how we can implement and automate some of the Workflow processes within the system.""
10. ""Are we on the Is that what you, did we understand you correctly?""

These questions helped the sales rep to understand the customer's needs and expectations, and to tailor the demo accordingly.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer did seem to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They expressed that the membership engagement and portal feature is a priority for their digital transformation program, and the seller's product appears to address this need. The customer also asked about the licensing cost and the effort required for implementation, indicating a serious interest in moving forward with the product. However, they also mentioned some limitations and concerns related to their upcoming games, so further discussion may be needed to address those concerns.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the prospect of using the seller's product to create a single source of truth for member profiles, which would allow them to have all member data in one system and improve communication with members through a member portal. They also appreciated the ability to customize the system to fit their specific needs and the potential for automation of workflow processes. The customer specifically mentioned the benefits of having a streamlined process and the ability to manage everything in one platform.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific pain points and requirements related to capturing and verifying signatures in the grant process. Although the rep briefly mentioned the possibility of using external partners for signature capture, they did not delve deeper into the customer's needs or concerns in this area.

2. The rep could have explored the customer's requirements for mass communication more thoroughly. While they mentioned the possibility of using the [ORG-5] automation tool for journeys and one-to-one communication, they did not discuss the customer's existing [PRODUCT-3] for mass communication or how the two systems could be integrated.

3. The rep could have asked more questions about the customer's digital transformation program and their priorities for technology investments. This would have helped the rep better understand the customer's context and tailor their proposal accordingly.

4. The rep could have inquired about the customer's capacity to start the project before the games and the potential impact on game operations. This would have helped the rep provide more specific advice on the best approach for the customer's situation.

5. The rep could have asked about the customer's existing licensing costs for [ORG-5] and the [PRODUCT-2] team's mass communication function to provide a more accurate estimate of the total investment required.

In general, the sales rep could have asked more open-ended questions and listened more actively to the customer's responses to better understand their needs and priorities. This would have helped the rep provide more targeted advice and build a stronger relationship with the customer.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question: ""Is it possible to have a workflow or approval process before changes to the member profile are reflected? Specifically, if someone updates the Secretary General's name, can it go through a review and approval process before it updates in the member's profile?""
   Engagement: The customer showed interest and asked a follow-up question about the flexibility to customize the member profile view based on the person logging in.

2. Question: ""Is it possible to have a chat function in the member portal, where the chat would be routed to an appropriate agent or team member based on the category or theme of the question?""
   Engagement: The customer asked for more details about the chat function, specifically whether it could be routed to individual people based on the topic or department.

3. Question: ""Can the system differentiate between opportunity-specific data and general member information, and avoid requiring the member to provide the same information twice?""
   Engagement: The customer asked for more information about how the system handles different types of data and how it can ensure a smooth experience for members when applying for opportunities.

These questions seemed to generate more engagement from the customer, as they asked follow-up questions and showed interest in the specific features and capabilities.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The transcript does not provide clear information on the customer's specific concerns about the seller's product. The customer asked some questions about the product's features and capabilities, such as the ability to customize the member portal experience for different audiences, the possibility of a chat function, and the integration with other systems. However, these questions do not necessarily indicate concerns, but rather a desire to understand the product better.

Answer to this question is unclear."
video_19794_167_6qr3y000000ohYQAAY,"Speaker 5: Great. Well, great. Well, happy
Agent: To spend some time with y'all this afternoon, especially right after the holidays. So, you know, [PERSON-1] and I. spend some time going through the notes that we took from that first call with you all.
Agent: And so we put together, you know, some slides to kind of talk through marketing clouds [DATE-1]. But we'd like to always kick off our presentations with a thank you all.
Agent: Thank you for the moment of gratitude just for you all being here with us for, you know, you know, taking this time [DATE-2].
Agent: I'm sure there's a lot of catching up to do from the holidays. So being able to take a little break from that. So we appreciate you all. doing that to me that time with us [DATE-1].
Agent: And if you've ever sat through a [ORG-1] presentation we always show our forward-looking statements, because just a reminder that we are publicl y created companies, so to be sure to make your purchasing decisions on products that ar e readily available [DATE-1] .
Agent: So don't need to read all that. Always fun. So we'll start. We don't need to do introductions. So I think we've all met each other here [DATE-1]. So we can fly through introductions.
Agent: And then we'll just spend a quick moment recapping what we heard [DATE-3] about what you're currently doing with part I, and then jump into the Marketing Cloud demo. That sounds all right. And you all.
Agent: So we were worried all the way back to [DATE-4] before the holidays. We, you know, got to spend some time with you all discussing what you're currently doing with hard.
Agent: In how Marketing Cloud may fit into the picture and the overall strategy. You know, what we heard was a lot about some potential for some efficiencies.
Agent: Y'all can gain less switching to Marketing Cloud into, you know, maybe improve on some of the manual processes you are currently doing, especially when it comes to, you know, the students going through the funnel from being admitted all the way through enrollment.
Agent: That right now there's a lot of manual processes you'll have to do in order to you know keep that communication going with the students and especially you know making sure they're targeted to the programs and the schools that they're admitted to as students change majors and do all the different changes that happen between being admitted to enrolling and leading up to orientation.
Agent: That if there's some possible efficiencies to gain with marketing cloud, so maybe you're not having to have all the school look at spreadsheets every day and compare changes and make things a little more streamlined automatic, that could be something helpful that you could get gained with marketing cloud.
Agent: And so we're gonna focus the rest of the afternoon on some of those like wins that you can get with Marketing Cloud and how it can improve.
Agent: Know what you're currently doing and how to make things a lot more efficient and then potentially you know how you can then look at how effective right now it sounded like you know being able to measure the effectiveness of some of your communications was a challenge and so figuring out ways to get with Market with Thought could help there too.
Agent: So with that, I'm going to turn it over to [PERSON-1] who spends some time putting together a demo focusing on some of these key areas to kind of show you how marketing thought can help and get your feedback on it.
Agent: Sounds like plan. Alright, [PERSON-1], how will turn it over to you then my friend.
Agent: Perfect. Thanks, [PERSON-2] and hi again everyone. I'll be off camera for the demonstration piece just that has my sharing multiple screens here typically has my computer fans, you know, running really hard and it sounds like a train sometimes.
Agent: I also in advance just want to share. I'm recovering from coven is my first go around with coven on [DATE-5].
Agent: And I feel fine, but I may need a pause to just cough a little or just take a sip of water. So please feel free as well throughout to ask any questions.
Agent: You know, we've got some good Content to cover with you all today And in terms of what to expect overall for our time together here I have this divided into five different sections largely to touch on a lot of what we heard in our last conversation with you But it also gives us some natural pauses throughout as well to dive a little bit [PERSON-3] r into any particular topic that may be of interest to you as well spend most of the time within the platform as [PERSON-4] You'll see this slide sort of [ORG-2] as we go throughout as [PERSON-4] But at least what to expect her e. I first wanna kick things o ff by first introducing you to Marketing Cloud at a very, very high [ORG-3] before touching on [GPE-1] and how Marketing Cloud supports [PERSON-5] So how different team s, could possibly work together within the same [PRODUCT-1] instance.
Agent: But also, how does that help us from a visibility perspective in terms of the messages that our constituents are receiving from different departments, different divisions, for example. From there, we'll have a bit more explicit conversation around data.
Agent: So how do we get data into the platform?
Agent: How can we build off of that unified data and do things like segmentation?
Agent: And what does that segmentation experience look like within the platform?
Agent: We'll do a little bit of a deeper dive around email as well. Not necessarily building a complete email from scratch, although we can do that. If that's something that's of interest to the group.
Agent: But my goal as we talk about email is largely to focus on some efficiencies around personalization and possibly some different ways that we can simplify some of your email creation process as well.
Agent: From then on, my favorite component is always talking about journeys. So in the part out world, this would be the equivalent of your engagement studio. It's journeys within marketing cloud.
Agent: So really looking at how do we automate your Outreach in key moments across the applicant lifecycle, but also ways that we can perhaps start to adapt the experience by listening to your constituents' behavior and really engaging them on those changes.
Agent: That are most effective at a specific point in their applicant life cycle . And then we'll ultimately wrap up around reporting and analytics as well.
Agent: So just some out of the box options available to you to really understand what's working, what's not working across your different marketing and communications efforts here.
Agent: Is there anything at least from the agenda perspective that, you know, we should spend most of our time on or is there anything missing perhaps that you haven't heard that we'll cover yet?
Agent: All right, so we'll keep the train moving here. So again, first we'll kick it off with an overview of marketing cloud. all of the different components that are built into the Marketing Cloud platform.
Agent: And then we'll have that more explicit conversation around governance here. So switching over to Marketing Cloud here. If this is your first time seeing the platform welcome. Where we're at in the platform here is the Marketing Cloud homepage.
Agent: And I wanted to kick off our conversation [DATE-1] on the homepage here, just so we can touch at a very high level, all of the different components that are built in to marketing cloud.
Agent: So really serving as that unified marketing platform for you. So what I'll direct your attention to here is in the top third or so of your screen here.
Agent: This is going to be that navigation bar that will be consistently appearing wherever you are in the platform. It's what you would use to navigate different areas of Marketing Cloud here.
Agent: In the top left, you have what we refer to as studios.
Agent: And this is what's going to help you create for and manage different key channels, whether that's email, which we'll do a deeper dive for later in the presentation.
Agent: In our last conversation, we spoke about mobile, right?
Agent: [DATE-6] you use [PERSON-6]. I'll touch on how we could integrate with [PERSON-6] from a journey perspective here. But if in the future, this is something where perhaps you want to.
Agent: Separate sort of communications from [ORG-4] do more of that once in many broadcast through [PRODUCT-1] that's possible.
Agent: We also from a mobile perspective also suppor t marketing and communications through a mobile app We didn't touch on this in our last conversation I saw that WT has, I saw an iOS app, I'm an [ORG-5] guy so I look for iOS specifically Not sure if it's used from any admissions perspective, but if in the future, that's sort of a new channel perhaps th at you want to explore with prospective student s. I did want to touch that core to [PRODUCT-1] is the opportunity here to also [PERSON-7] prospective students through that mobile [ORG-6] as well is web.
Agent: And this is the component that you would largely use for things like landing pages or for things like RF5 forms, for example. An option to explore in the future is advertising.
Agent: I know from our last conversation, it's largely organic social that you do [DATE-1]. Not much advertising, paid advertising, if I remember correctly, but if in the future, this is something that you wish to explore with [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: This is definitely an add-on that we see customers grow into. From an advertising perspective, what you'll see when we talk.
Agent: About journeys, if this is sort of a new channel, perhaps that you want t o introduce here to your applicants or prospective students, is being able t o coordinate advertising alongside your email efforts, your SMS efforts, fo r example.
Agent: And from an advertising perspective, it's not necessarily buildin g your ads that we're supporting here. What we're doing with [PRODUCT-1] i s helping you automate your ad audiences.
Agent: I know budget i s something that's, you know, of top of mind for the grou p. And from an advertising perspective, you know, that could be expensiv e. That was a big line item when I was in admissions that we ha d. But this is a bit more of an opportunity here to really build, look like audience s. Build those targeted audiences that you want to reach and be a bit more intentional from an advertising [ORG-7] This is just something that I wanted to highlight for you as a growth area with the pla .
Agent: Um,
Agent: So outside of our studios working alongside there, you have what we refer to as builders.
Agent: And these are what's largely gonna help you to connect your data, your content, your channels together, whether that's gonna be for analytics purposes, whether it's gonna be for those automated journeys, our [PRODUCT-2] builder, which we'll see when we talk about email, this is sort of your asset repository within the platform.
Agent: Think of it as a very, very lightweight [ORG-8] where you're storing imagery. templates, even blocks of text as we'll cover later . You also have our audience builder, which we'll dive into in the next section here.
Agent: This is the area that we would focus on to connect our data sources alongside building out our targeted segments within the platform.
Agent: And what you'll see me also mention at different points throughout the demonstration is [PERSON-8], which you may already be familiar from the [PRODUCT-3] side. [PERSON-8] is our [PRODUCT-4] capabilities across the [ORG-1] ecosystem. And it's also built into marketing.
Agent: Cloud here. So we'll see opportunities here to tap into [PRODUCT-4] from both a predictive perspective but also a generative [PRODUCT-4] perspective as well .
Agent: And as I mentioned, I'd love to start here just to give you that broad level view of all the different components that are built into our [PRODUCT-1] platform.
Agent: Again, you're doing this from one single location versus needing to work across different systems to manage different channels or create those automated experiences here.
Agent: All of these components that we covered here can be turned on or off as needed, depending on a user's responsibility.
Agent: And ultimately, if the platform expands to support other schools or other divisions, for example, you know, certain divisions or teams may not need access to mobile or to advertising or web, for example, all of this is, you can configure with permissions to turn on or off as you need.
Agent: One of the areas that we spoke about in our last conversation was a little bit of a challenge around visibility into messaging, especially as you're getting closer to orientation.
Agent: It sounded like some different teams may be either sending the same type of communication or messaging, or even conflicting messaging, which I've experienced in the path before when I was in higher ed.
Agent: So what I wanna mention that out of the box with [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: You would also have access to a centralized calendar here What's going to be key here is thi s is one of those ways that's going to help increase visibilit y across any of those teams that are using [PRODUCT-1] .
Agent: For their marketing and communications efforts. That's all done through what we refer to as business units.
Agent: I'm gonna put a pause on what a business unit is for just one quick second, but I at least wanted to highlight for you that depending on your level of access, you could get visibility into what other teams, divisions, schools are sending through Marketing Cloud here.
Agent: And similar to [GPE-2], this is gonna automatically display any.
Agent: Past funds, any future scheduled funds, and you also have the ability to add manually you know, certain things like events or important deadlines that you want to meet The idea here, you know, it's one of those simple ways to increase visibility, but to also star t to eliminate some of that <inaudible> work, especially for those ad hoc communications on when to nex t <inaudible> and a communication and ensure that we're not over communicating with students on a particula r day of the week her e. I'll take a quick pause here, see if there are any questions so far before we talk about how different teams can work together from the same [PRODUCT-1] instance.
Agent: All right, and sorry if you hear me taking a sip of water here. Alright, so let's move more into that governance conversation here.
Agent: What I want to highlight at a very high level is that [PRODUCT-1] itself is built on an Enterprise architecture.
Agent: What does that mean?
Agent: Well, it means that the platform itself is designed to scale with you as needs change. It could be as simple as supporting a single team. Or we can scale this to support the entire university end-to-end.
Agent: And we have customers where it's only one unit of the university using [PRODUCT-1] to others that are using this from admissions all the way through advancements and alumni relations.
Agent: How we're able to do this, as you see represented by these different rectangles here, is what we refer to as business units that you can think of as dedicated workspaces within the platform here.
Agent: And from a governance perspective, it's these dedicated workspaces that limit a team to only have access to the data, the content, the reporting that only applies to that specific business unit.
Agent: On the other hand, this is also an opportunity here from a brand consistency perspective to also share assets across these different business units.
Agent: So think of that as more marketing approved assets, you know, what's our approved logos, what are imagery that we should be including across our email communications to maintain that consistent brand regardless of who across the university is engaging our constituents.
Agent: And it's through these business units as well that you can scale over time.
Agent: So at any point, if a new team wishes to tap into [PRODUCT-1] and use the platform, it's simply a matter of just working with [PERSON-2] to either add a new business unit or just fairly simple, just conversation with [PERSON-2] there and she can work with you.
Agent: But I at least wanted to touch on here because this is that business unit sort of hierarchy.
Agent: That helps different schools, divisions, teams coexist within the same [PRODUCT-1] instance And really at [DATE-7], ensure that you're only accessing what your tea m specifically needs for their marketing and communications .
Agent: So what we've seen so far, a lot of those different components you with marketing cloud, you know, business units and available to
Speaker 6: How we can use that to maintain governance within the platform. [PERSON-1], can I. For a second. I think it's important to note from my perspective anyway, that those additional business units do cost additional money.
Speaker 6: For each additional business unit we add there's a set price [DATE-8] that we have to pay that's added on to our contract. And I believe the next business unit would be $[MONEY-1] a month.
Agent: Yeah, I'll let [PERSON-2] chime in. If you want [PERSON-9], kind of the, I guess the package that we're thinking to in terms of business units or
Agent: I'll let you take that. Yeah, you're your spot on [PERSON-10]. So it is this issue has to cost, additionally. So, and that's something we can work through depending on volume of business units
EndUser: You could potentially need with that pricing would look like. I have a question with the business units. I used to be on the academic side. And so I went through this long time ago with academic affairs.
EndUser: And I know that academic affairs was a business unit.
EndUser: And [PERSON-9], you may know this, is graduate school and college or business, are they under academic affairs?
Speaker 6: I remember we had business units set up a long time ago. Yes, everything right now pretty much is under academic affairs. We have a business unit reserve for philanthropy Go Live with advanced.
EndUser: And external relations once we
Speaker 6: And we have one
EndUser: For student affairs.
Agent: Okay, okay, got it. And that I would say from how you structure business units here, I might not touch on that, but sort of that model is flexible to what makes sense for you at [PERSON-11].
Agent: You know, we see some customers structure their hierarchy, just like their reporting, their overall university work structure. We see it sometimes more of a flat sort of approach to business units.
Agent: So all the colleges are sort of on the same sort of level of the hierarchy. Or like you see here with, you know, you have your, your.
Agent: Parents sort of admissions unit if you will and right below that opportunity t o split that out by undergraduate or graduate. So this is all a hierarchy.
Agent: S o you have your top-level administrative unit, you have your sort of your chil d business unit here depending on how you structure that whether it's by school division, and then you can start to branch this further down as needed fo r what works for you at WT [DATE-1] .
Agent: So it's completely
Agent: Flexible.
Agent: Any other questions before we talk about data?
Agent: All right.
Agent: So... where we're moving into now is a focus on how Marketing Cloud works with your data and ultimately how do we get data in, how do we get data out, and what can we start to do with that data easily within the platform here.
Agent: So we jump back into the Marketing Cloud here. What you're seeing on your screen is just a visualization of how Marketing Cloud will work with your data here.
Agent: Marketing Cloud itself from a data model perspective, it's a relational data model. So what that means is that you have the opportunity here to connect directly to different types of systems.
Agent: And all of those data fields that you wish to bring into [PRODUCT-1], we're going to relate that back to each individual constituent. So some systems may have, you know, some bits of data points that others don't.
Agent: And what we're trying to help you do here with Marketing Cloud is build a bit more of that fuller 3D.
Agent: Degree view of your constituents across those different systems here And because this is a marketing platform we're pairing what you know about a constituent across your different systems We're pairing that with their engagement data within [PRODUCT-1] So how are they engaging or not engaging across different channels So it's both what we know about a constituent along with their engagement s and their behavior across your different marketing channels here .
Agent: How you bring data into the platform, you have a few different options here.
Agent: What I'm gonna focus on initially here is that direct connection through a connector that we have with the [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-3] or for you that would be enrollment [PRODUCT-5].
Agent: What's going to be slightly different here relative to [GPE-3] is how we work with different objects within the [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: So through this connector that we have, you synchronize the different standard or custom objects from the [PRODUCT-3] that you wish to bring in to [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: From our last conversation, I believe [PERSON-9], your team helps to move certain fields from custom objects onto the contact record or one of those standard objects. This is one of those ways of marketing [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: You wouldn't necessarily need to do that anymore. We can connect directly to those custom objects and with our relational data model here, still connect those data points to that single individual, that individual constituent.
Agent: These different standard or custom objects, how we're synchronizing them, is you're gonna specify what field specifically from those objects you wanna bring over.
Agent: You're also gonna specify the frequency, excuse me, the schedule that you wish to connect those objects to.
Agent: So this is something that's flexible here, where it could be as fast as connecting it as quickly as [TIME-1], all the way to [TIME-2]. So there might be certain objects.
Agent: Where we don't necessarily need that data [ORG-9] within the platform So you can specify that that's seeing schedule here I'm giving this a second to load here but what it's going to display for yo u is all of those different field s that we're at least connecting in my demo environment her e from our contact record So I would say from a data connection perspective this might be the primary [PERSON-11] y that you're connecting directly to enrollment R X to Marketing Cloud and keeping all of that data synchronize d. And we're not sort of refreshing the entirety of that data her e. The data synchronized so any data field that's been update d, that's what's going to sink ove r. We're not refreshing all of the dat a.
Agent: So from a synchronization [ORG-10] e, it tends to be a fairly quick and synchronized process her e.
Agent: Out of the box, [PRODUCT-1] does not offer a least scoring mechanism like part offers.
Agent: There are however ways that you can build that into the platform, whether it's building that automation directly within [PRODUCT-1] or exploring something like an app exchange partner that has a solution built out for lead scoring.
Agent: If you keep [WORK_OF_ART-1] and add on [PRODUCT-1] in the future, any of those fields from [WORK_OF_ART-1],
EndUser: We could bring into [PRODUCT-1] as well.
EndUser: Does that help answer your question, [GPE-4]?
EndUser: Yeah, that helps because one of the things that we know that we want to make sure that we're doing is as that as a student progresses through the process if they're not opening their emails or not interacting with things that we've sent them or Interacting with the social media.
EndUser: We know that those students are less likely to finish the entire process and we want to make sure that we're putting emphasis on our staff to The ones that are more likely to register and roll And so with that process, I
Agent: Just want to make sure that we understand what we have available to us. So thank you.
Agent: Yeah, and what I will highlight is through [PERSON-8], our [PRODUCT-4] within marketing cloud, there are two components that I'll touch on when we talk about journeys where from an engagement perspective, that's sort of the shift in [PRODUCT-1] that we're moving our scoring model to, right?
Agent: I did mention we don't have sort of that out-of-box Lead Scoring model like Part Not Offers where if you're scoring and grading your constituents, right?
Agent: But what we do offer with marketing cloud.
Agent: Is sort of [PRODUCT-4] driven scoring, if you will So what we're looking at is engagement How likely are they to click an email, open an email How saturated are they with communication So we do offer sort of more engagement focuse d scoring, if you will not necessarily the traditional Lead Scoring mode l that part offers [DATE-1] .
Agent: And we'll revisit that again when we talk about journeys. I'm excited to show you that piece as well.
Agent: Any other questions here before we move into segmentation here?
Agent: All right. So being able to have that flexibility and being able to connect across different data sources, what you're ultimately building here is that data foundation within marketing cloud.
Agent: And we want to make sure that you're able to action all of that connected data within the platform here. And one of those ways where that unified data foundation comes into play here is segmentation within the platform.
Agent: And that's what we're looking at here on your screen now. It's just an example of. a sample segment that I started looking at undergraduate applicants that ar e freshmen or transfer applicants.
Agent: From a segmentation perspective, this is goin g to be a clicks not Code approach. It's going to be a lot of drag and [ORG-9] functionality.
Agent: So your staff doesn't necessarily need to learn or [PERSON-11] w how to create SQL codes, for example. But if they prefer to work through SQL that's definitely available within the platform as well.
Agent: I'm not supe r technical myself in that end, so I prefer drag and drop functionality her e. What that experience is going to look like, again, building off of that data foundati on here on the left hand side, you're going to have access to all of those relevant fiel ds that you connect to Marketing [PERSON-16] And with a click of a button here, drag and drop functionality, I should say we can start to bring in over any of those fields that are going to be important for us as we build out our segments.
Agent: And with the click of a button, we can then start to adjust our filter logic here and or to account for any of that distinction between the fields that we've incorporated in our segment statement.
Agent: And here at the bottom, you can start to see what we're actually coding or you.
Agent: Using SQL for in the back end, but with drag and [ORG-9] functionality here So you can always verify that your logic within you r segments is representative of what it is that you want t o build .
Agent: All we're doing here so far is just segmenting based off of any of those data points that you're already collecting across your systems [DATE-1].
Agent: But because this is a unified marketing platform, as part of your segmentation strategy, you can also start to account for engagement behavior. That's what we're looking at here where I'm hovering my mouse now.
Agent: Our different measures that are out of the box with the platform that you can incorporate as part of your segmentation strategy.
Agent: So let's say we wanted to build our segment here and really identify those that have not actively engaged our emails in [DATE-9] here.
Agent: So this segment that we're building, perhaps it's, you know, we want to take our conversatio n offline for these types of students here And that's one of the, I would say the beauty of the platform and not only having data o f what you know about a constituent, but being able to layer on how they're engaging or no t engaging across your different marketing channels here and embedding that as part of your segmentatio n strategy .
Agent: The point here is building off of that unified data is that you can get granular with your segmentation here. And at [DATE-7], ensure that you're always identifying the right audience with the right message here.
Agent: And hopefully your takeaway there is that it's very easy to segment with within the platform there. And again, building off of that unified data foundation within marketing cloud.
Agent: And what I'll mention as well from a segmentation perspective, typically these segments that you're building are most commonly probably going to be used for an email send.
Agent: But from an efficiency standpoint, what I want to highlight is that any of these segments that you build within the platform can also be used across other areas of marketing cloud, whether it's to use this as a segment that we want to target for SMS purposes, whether it's a segment that we want to add on.
Agent: To a journey that we build which we'll cover in the fourth section of the demonstratio n [DATE-1] So, you know, these segments are not static You can use them beyond just email in different areas of the platform .
Agent: Alright, any questions before we move into the email experience here?
Agent: All right, so let's keep moving here. So from an email experience, I'm going to touch on different aspects of what email looks like within [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: We won't necessarily completely build an email together here, but I do want to touch on a few different components that are specific to the Marketing Cloud here.
Agent: The first that you see on your screen here is that [ORG-11]. This is going to serve as that.
Agent: That asset repository for you within the platform This is completely customizable from a foldering structur e to keep you organized in the [PERSON-13] e to your different campaigns or different sort of team s within the platform We're looking at this, this local ta b is what's saved directly to my business unit my teams workspace But as I mentioned earlier, through those business units you can also share assets [ORG-11] those different workspace And this is where you would access that shared tab here to access those shared resource s. From a [PRODUCT-2] perspective, this is where you would start to build out your differe nt email templates, your emails, your SMS messages, things like form s. Let's see what else do we got here.
Agent: We did forms, imagery, you would save here as well. So this is intended to be that asset repository for your different teams. As it relates to creating emails themselves, you have a few different options here.
Agent: So if your staff prefers to work off of HTML, that is an option here, but they don't need to do that.
Agent: Out of the box, which is similar to what you have with Part.[DATE-6], you do have access to pre-built templates that are already mobile optimized. They're also, as you'll see shortly, tap into drag and drop functionality.
Agent: So you don't necessarily need to. to learn or know how to Code your emails at HTML .
Agent: Outside of these out-of-the-box templates, you have some blank Content layouts as well, along with some thematic templates for things like newsletters, for example. You can access these out-of-the-box templates for any new emails.
Agent: You can also start to save any specific templates that are frequently used for your different types of communications here. So you're not always starting from scratch. You're the template that you wish to follow for your community.
Agent: I'm going to click out of this here. From an email creation process, just want to focus on a few different areas here.
Agent: Your marketers can either work off of a desktop or a mobile view as they build out your emails. And this template that you're seeing here is actually using one of our out-of-the-box templates.
Agent: So I did at least want to highlight that you can set to see how things are already mobile optimized for you. Any of those templates that you build within the platform can be completely locked down.
Agent: So in this example here, our header, our footer is completely locked down. Within the body of the email, we can also lock down specific sections of the body as well.
Agent: In terms of adding [PRODUCT-2] through your emails, you have a few different options here, some static content. So that could be, you know, adding a button into our email. It could be adding an image.
Agent: It could be adding text here. And similar to what you have at Pardot [DATE-1], it's a friendly, [ORG-11] editor. They should look fairly familiar for what you have access to in Pardot [DATE-1].
Agent: And generally, if you're using [PRODUCT-7] or something like [ORG-16], very familiar experience for you there. Outside of that static Content here, opportunities to conduct a B test, as well as dynamic Content for more advanced [PRODUCT-2] capabilities here.
Agent: Also an opportunity to tap into AI-driven content. So we see certain customers tap into AI here to select at the time of open certain imagery that that imagery is going to resonate most individual constituents.
Agent: So again, an opportunity here to really adapt that experience for eac h individual constituent .
Agent: From a personalization perspective, this is where we start to once again, build upon that data foundation within the platform. Fairly straightforward personalization. I think of this in a few different levels.
Agent: Level one is tapping into any of those data fields that you have connected to Marketing Cloud and using that as a merge field throughout the email subject line or the body of your emails.
Agent: A step up from that I like to think of as dynamic content. So from one single email, we can start to display different [PRODUCT-2] to different types of audiences.
Agent: What I think is going to be slightly different in [PRODUCT-1] relative to Pardot is that we can actually create dynamic Content a bit more granular if it is.
Agent: If I remember correctly, it's been a while since I've been in part. [ORG-13] is typically restricted to one single field. With Marketing Cloud, that's going to not be an issue here.
Agent: You can again tap into any of your data fields within the platform and start to build out who should see what specific piece of content. So a bit more flexibility from a personalization perspective.
Agent: And also, probably means that you're not creating specific.
Agent: [PERSON-16] just to be able to dynamically personalize your communications here And that experience, just as you saw here, it's actually going to be similar to how w e created our segments in the last section here So drag and drop functionality to define who should see what's a specific piece of [PRODUCT-2] .
Agent: And really that third layer of personalization is going to be that AI-driven Content for you.
Agent: What I haven't mentioned yet as another option to add [PRODUCT-2] to your emails, I'm going to delete this whole text block here and draw your attention to this create button that you see in the bottom left.
Agent: As of [DATE-10], if my timing is correct, we introduced some generative [PRODUCT-4] capabilities within [PRODUCT-1] here, where we can start to tap into generatively. to help us build out some [PRODUCT-2] .
Agent: I used to, when I was in admissions, I was partially responsible for creating [PRODUCT-2] for our different programs. I myself am not the most creative person and I'm being quite honest with you.
Agent: So some of my communications over time start to sound very similar to each other. But also, I was part of a small team. So to refresh our [PRODUCT-2] was sometimes a lift year on [DATE-9].
Agent: So I wish I had generative [PRODUCT-4]. back in [DATE-11] or so.
Agent: But what does that experience look like for you?
Agent: It's simply a matter of [PERSON-13] your prompts into our generative [PRODUCT-4] capabilities, selecting a type of brand personality. Out of th e box you have a Professional and casual brand personality.
Agent: You also have the ability to creat e up to 10 custom personalities that are reflective of you at WT . We'll say we want a casual personality. We'll accept our disclaimer. We'll hit Create.
Agent: And as this creates, it's going to spit out five different options or so of content. If you've worked with chat [ORG-16] before, you can start to train the model for the type of [PRODUCT-2] that's most important to you.
Agent: So, I'm going to go ahead and go ahead. from a accessibility perspective here and more so just having this available as an option.
Agent: It's a great way to brainstorm new ideas to refresh your [PRODUCT-2] much more quickly as well. So let's say we like a specific piece of content, we'll just simply add it into our email there and then move forward.
Agent: The last bit that I want to highlight for you from an email creation processes the ability to embed forms directly within your emails. Let's see. that should refresh once we go into preview mode.
Agent: But as part of our email creation process, you have the ability to embed forms directly within your emails. From an experience perspective, embedding these forms means that you're not directing your applicants to a landing page.
Agent: We often found when I was in admissions that we would see a drop-off. People would click the link, see that they have to go somewhere else and tend to not follow through with that form submission.
Agent: This is an opportunity here to build that directly within the email and have your applicants or your prospective students fill out the form directly within their inbox. These forms are completely customizable.
Agent: So you have options to customize the form and collect different types of data points, whether that's text-based field, drop-downs, things like radio buttons, checkboxes, or my favorites is the opportunity here to collect some ratings.
Agent: From a use case perspective, being able to use this after an admissions event to collect feedback, or like the form that I don't know.
Agent: Out here trying to collect some additional data points around a applicant's interes t at the specific point of time in their journey with you .
Agent: What's going to be key here is that any of these data points, these forms that get submitted, those responses do get Recorded back immediately into marketing [PRODUCT-8].
Agent: So what that means for you is that you can start to tap into those new data points, whether it's for personalization or segmentation for your next communication, or as you'll see here shortly, if I respond saying that I want to learn more about my financing options for my undergraduate degree.
Agent: If you have a journey already built out this is an opportunity to automate that process get that information immediately into the hand s of your applicants and sort of remove your staf f from needing to compare lists and so on So getting that information quickly to our students .
Agent: And we'll go into preview here, but I'll take a quick pause to if we have
Speaker 6: Any questions from an email perspective here.
Agent: Does that form data just stay in Marketing Cloud or does it go back to the [PRODUCT-3] as well?
Agent: You could you could push it back out.
Agent: All right.
Agent: Any other questions?
Agent: This is just me showing you the dynamic Content piece here of the email. So we have our process.
EndUser: Go ahead. Yeah, so piggybacking on [PERSON-9]'s question there. So is it a big
Agent: Process to push that data back to the [PRODUCT-3]?
Agent: Like would it be a lot on IT?
Agent: No, it's going to tap into that synchronization between both the [PRODUCT-3] and marketing cloud. So I think upfront, it's just making sure you have on the [PRODUCT-3] those fields where that data should be pushed to.
EndUser: And then it'll sink over on the cadence
Agent: That you set with the native connector. Okay.
Agent: So hopefully [PERSON-9], that makes your life a little easier there if we're pushing back D.A. into the [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: Great. So, you know, here we have [PERSON-16] here. We know that she's a freshman applicant. So, you know, from a dynamic [PRODUCT-2] perspective, she's seeing that [PRODUCT-2] directly for that type of student.
Agent: Whereas [PERSON-17] here, we have as a transfer applicant, so they're seeing a completely sort of dynamic [PRODUCT-2] as part of their email experience. What I didn't mention for dynamic [PRODUCT-2] is that it's flexible here.
Agent: We can either apply dynamic content.
Agent: To a specific image or as you see here to certain portions of our email or the entire email itself So some flexibility here to have one template to reach different types of audiences .
Agent: And walking through those different components here, my goal was to at least show you how quickly and easily we can start to build our email [PRODUCT-2] here.
Agent: And again, the clicks not Code approach, drag and drop functionality, no need to dig into [LAW-1] for our emails here.
Agent: All right, so where we're moving into now is the journey component of [PRODUCT-1]. This is going to largely be equivalent to your engagement studio in Part.
Agent: We will walk through an example here of the different components that our journeys entail. But really, the message here is around automation.
Agent: How do we start to remove any manual processes?
Agent: Whether it's adapting the experience for our students and ensuring that we're moving them or connecting them to that next journey that makes sense for where they're at in their particular applicant journey here or switching our communications channel here.
Agent: So we'll touch on that here in a second. As we go through journeys here, what I wanna highlight is that these can be as simple or as sophisticated as we need them to be.
Agent: Simple meaning, perhaps it's a traditional trip we're communicating through a single channel More sophisticated, perhaps we're introducing new channel s that we wanna communicate with our students wit h or adapting the journey based off of how they engag e or not engage with a specific communication And these are completely flexible, the journeys themselves We've seen customers, I'm thinking of your yield lead right, having that nurture built out for those I believe you said it was [DATE-11] or s o where someone is sort of in that limbo period, if you will, from an admit to enroll.
Agent: It might be sort of a simple push to apply sort of journey that you're building here or using journeys to transition them to their points of contact at the different colleges or schools at WT here.
Agent: So very flexible from an automation [ORG-7] So I went ahead and started to build out a journey for us to work off of for [DATE-1].
Agent: This is going to operate like a Workflow similar to what you're used to from the engagement studio side. What I want to highlight are a few different components here.
Agent: These green icons means how do we get someone into a journey?
Agent: How do we automate that process?
Agent: That could be because of a segment that we built within the platform. It could be because of an API.
Agent: So a certain action was taken on a different system and we have that connected to Marketing Cloud we can use that API event as a trigge r to add someone onto our journey It could be because someone filled ou t one of those forms that you saw, or perhaps an [ORG-13] form And building off of that [ORG-16] that we have with this [PRODUCT-3], we can als o start to listen for a specific fiel d to be updated or populated with data on the CRM sid e and use that to automatically add [NORP-1] e onto a relevant journey So some flexible options here for how how we get someone into a journe y.
Agent: Where you start to see some differentiation, I would say with engagement studio is the ability to start to incorporate different channels. whether again, that's going to be email.
Agent: If you decide to tap into the SMS component of [PRODUCT-1], an opportunity here to engage through the SMS component of [PRODUCT-1], push notifications, in-app messages, or even the future advertising is that area that you wish to explore, automatically adding someone to an ad audience as part of that journey component here.
Agent: I did want to mention I was doing some research around [ORG-17].
Agent: And if you decide to stick with [ORG-17] for the once many the broadcast component, they do have a way to connect that into [PRODUCT-1] so that we can do those once many broadcast SMS through [ORG-17].
Agent: So no need SMS if you don't want to go on stick with [ORG-17] here.
EndUser: To switch to the Marketing Cloud
Agent: So they want to make that call out for you. I was going to be one of my questions, so thank you very much. Of course, yeah. Sort of the next step here is these orange icons.
Agent: This is where that automation power starts to come into play here. It could be as simple as adding wait time in between when [PRODUCT-2] is being sent out. It could be something like a decision point.
Agent: Let's look at a specific field to determine what that next step is for an applicant in our journey.
Agent: It could be also listening to their behavior, that they click an email, that they not click, that they open the email, that they not open the email.
Agent: Based off of that behavior, we can start to split them out onto these different branches of our Workflow to adapt automatically the experience that we're delivering to our constituents.
Agent: Also an opportunity here to tap into some [ORG-26] testing as well. Whether it's testing a new channel, whether it's testing different email communications or versions of an email, [ORG-26] is what you can do with injuries here.
Agent: Also opportunities to automate certain actions on the [PRODUCT-3] side, whether that's updating a specific field on your contact records, you know, adding someone onto a campaign on the [PRODUCT-3] side, opening a case, I know task was something that was key in terms of your processes [DATE-1].
Agent: So as part of your journeys, opportunities here to create a task for an admissions counselor perhaps to take some action as part of that lecture. any touch point here .
Agent: And before I touch on the [PRODUCT-4] components here, just want to highlight at a very high level, how it all comes together here, right?
Agent: So for this example journey, we're sending off an initial email, we're waiting [DATE-11], the second email will go out, we'll wait [DATE-16], we'll check against that enrollment status.
Agent: Is someone enrolled or registered, I believe, was another status that you equate to enrolled there?
Agent: You know, that they enroll, great, let's automatically remove them from the journey. We don't need to communicate with them. From that, your staff doesn't need to take any action to remove them either.
Agent: If they didn't enroll, then you know what?
Agent: Let's keep communicating. Let's keep driving that interest, keeping them engaged, to hopefully get them to that enrollment point there. That takes me to these [ORG-16] here.
Agent: These are the [PRODUCT-4] components that you can tap into as part of the journey experience here. A few different options. options here that could be [ORG-17] or what we refer to a s then time optimization.
Agent: So when we think about elevating th e applicant experience from our marketing communication s perspective, it means reaching students with the righ t message at the right time.
Agent: This is where [ORG-17] is a componen t you can tap into where we can send this first initial emai l depending on where you want to place it in the journey directl y to each individual constituents at th e exact moment that they're most likely to click an email or open that [PERSON-26] And it's going to do this at scale for each of your different constituent s. So for me, over time, [ORG-19] may recognize that I tend to click your emails at 10 A M. For [PERSON-2], that might be 8 A M. For [PERSON-16], that might be 6 A M. It's going to adapt this experience for each individual constituent a nd reach me at that point where I'm most likely to engage that [PERSON-26] The other two options here, what that's going to do is split out your journey constituent into different types of segments.
Agent: So this is going to touch into sort of that engagement scoring that I was speaking through earlier here. So for example, one of those options is a scoring split.
Agent: So with Marketing Cloud, we're going to automatically segment your constituents based off of their likelihood to click an email.
Agent: We're going to deem someone as most likely to click all the way down to least likel y to click . When you incorporate these components into your journeys, you're gonna build out these different branches.
Agent: And these are insights that your staff can start to tap into to build out that experience for a particular constituent.
Agent: So when we think about maximizing the time that we have for our constituents, this is those insights that can help us determine what's that next best touch point that we should include in our journey.
Agent: So if someone's most likely to click an email, you know what, let's make sure that first touch point is going to be. going to be an email.
Agent: If someone's least likely to click an email, then let's move the conversatio n to a different channel, or perhaps you want to prioritize those types of students fo r admissions counselors to have that more direct offline Outreach .
Agent: That's going to be the scoring split.
Agent: The frequency split is going to operate in a similar manner where we do segment out your constituents, but rather than looking and considering likelihood to engage in email, we're looking at overall level of saturation.
Agent: So it's someone oversaturated or under saturated. And I was thinking that this might be helpful in that interim period. Those [DATE-13], that met someone is from an admitted to an enrolled, tapping into this component here to adapt.
Agent: Experience and reach your constituents on those channels that they're mos t responsive to during that time period .
EndUser: So on the email click split, if the student clicks on the email and opens it, then does the other items end up happening or does it not?
Agent: Do you mean by other items kind of this a sequence that yep so it'll automatically you know push them into that particular path
EndUser: Or branch of the workflow?
EndUser: So say that we do no matter what.
Agent: All of them get the email
EndUser: And depending on the opening of the email or nonopening of the email during a certain period of time, then can either a text or the text message
Agent: Be added at that point?
Agent: Good question. Let me backtrack a little here. So when we're thinking about steps, right, and sort of what that next touch point is going to be, let me include this
EndUser: Engagement split.
Agent: Ok No, no, this is perfect because it gives me a time to correct myself actually.
Agent: So when we were talking about pushing someone onto the next step, right, should they receive this next email, that's where you would use that engagement split. That's more of in the moment.
Agent: Did they click this first initial email?
Agent: Yes or no?
Agent: And then we pushed them onto the appropriate path based off of that engagement. The [PRODUCT-4] component here, this is going to look more historically at a constituent's typical type of engagement. So over time.
Agent: Is someone most likely to click emails or are the least likely to click emails So this is where we take more of a holistic historical analysis
EndUser: Or embed that type of historical analysis within her journey . Okay, that makes more sense because we know for a fact that like we'll send an emissions decision by email, they get it in two places.
EndUser: They get it on their portal, the minute the decision is made. And then they also get an email when everything is ready to go out the residency decision their ID number and their email is all generated.
EndUser: And then we will still have students that will not check their portal or open that email. And so then our next step is that the emissions counselor has to either give them a call or a text message.
EndUser: To actually even tell them that they've got admitted because we don't even know if they're opening their mail to find out if they have an admissions decision . So unfortunately, we have to make sure that they're doing something
Agent: In order to make sure that they even understand that they're admitted to the university. Absolutely. And that was sort of the experience I had as well. I was always excited when our decisions went out.
Agent: And for those, you know, for different applicants, I would keep a closer eye on for on some, for example, and just make sure that they open their admissions letter and if they did it, you know, that was sort of a red flag for me.
Agent: It's like, are we, did they deposit somewhere else?
Agent: Or, you know, are we not top of mind for them at that moment?
Agent: So, you know, to your point, [GPE-4], you know, why wait?
Agent: You know, wait for them to check the decision.
Agent: If we know that they're not likely to engage in email, then let's just have that conversation offline and sort of start to save some of that time where we could convert them to that next step in the process here.
Agent: So opportunities here to either approach that either way.
Agent: So it's flexible for you, whether you want to send out the emails first and then wait for their behavior, or if we want to include sort of this layer here and start to analyze how, you know, what's their historical type of engagement?
Agent: What's that best initial touch point that we should have for it?
EndUser: And that is a definite improvement on making sure that we instead of having to do everyone every single time, on what's needed.
Agent: Breaking it up based That would save us time and energy.
EndUser: So.
Agent: Yeah, and it helps it helps your admissions counselors as well prioritize those students where they need more of that direct sort of high touch sort of approach to their experience.
Agent: What I want to quickly move into as well, I wanted to address that challenge that you all had around difficulties identifying effectiveness of your sort of different efforts here.
Agent: One of those ways that I wanted to highlight is through the journey analytics themselves. So what you're seeing here are what we refer to as inline analytics at each of the different stages of our journey.
Agent: This is a sort of dummy thing.
Agent: That I use for this email send here for this journey but it gets the point across So different layers of insights that you can start to [ORG-25] e as part of your journey effort here For emails that you build into journeys you can simply click into thos e and see your sort of high leve l deliverability information opens, clicks, how many people receive our emails We can adjust our timeframe there .
Agent: We can also start to see here in the bottom a quick at a glance view how many people received our email. And in this case, you see this little trophy icon there.
Agent: Something I didn't mention is that for journeys here, you can start to set some top level goals here.
Agent: So when we think about the effectiveness of our efforts, we can start to set specific definitions for what our journey goals are.
Agent: For this one, I've set our goal of wanting [PERCENT-1] of anyone that enters this journey to come. for it off of that journey .
Agent: You What this is telling me here is that after our first initial email, we waited to days and we can see that roughly a third of those individuals that we communicated through email converted off of that first initial email and met the criteria for our goals.
Agent: So when you think about our broader efforts here, you know, where should we spend our time focused on, right?
Agent: On one hand, this is telling you what's working well, what's not working well. And as part of your journeys, what's not working well, that's an opportunity.
Agent: For your staff to really spend their time focused on those specific points in the journey where w e need to put a bit more attention, perhaps it's refreshing our content, perhaps it's, you know experimenting, introducing a new channel as part of that journey step .
Agent: And this all runs sort of in the background for you here. So no need for your staff to pull a report and so on to surface this up for you. It's done all automatically for you behind the scenes.
Agent: So really what we're seeing there is just different ways that we can accelerate the applicant experience, right?
Agent: A lot of what you saw was being able to adapt the experience based off of their historical behavior or their end-to-moment behavior.
Agent: Did they click?
Agent: Did they open an email?
Agent: What action did they take?
Agent: But also ways here to also automate, you know, that offline Outreach as well. So, um, publications. I know that's also important for you. That's something that is coming to mind here that I didn't cut. [PERSON-17] Yet .
Agent: There's an opportunity here as part of journeys here to drop individuals perhaps onto a campaign on the [PRODUCT-3]. So some customers that print mailing or publications is a key sort of touchpoint for their constituents.
Agent: The way they automate that is by adding sort of specific individuals onto a campaign on the [PRODUCT-3] as a list and then sending that out to their in-house sort of.
Agent: A print shop or an external vendor that' s either working with When you think about who should receive sort of specific type s of publications, I know that that can sometimes get expensive So you can start to tap into your journeys her e and ensure that only those that need to receive a prin t communication is actually receiving it So just an opportunity here to perhaps save some dollar s in terms of budgets .
Agent: I know that there are certain communications that you all send that everyone has to receive.
Agent: Great, not a problem, but for those where we want to be a bit more intentional of who we're sending communications to, that's also a way that you can automate that with insurance.
Agent: All right, so that brings me here to reporting and analytics and some of the different options that you have available to you beyond just those journey analytics that you saw.
Agent: So let's go give me a second here to log in. This is the Security of our platform here where you know it times out, it logs you out automatically when you're not actively using that window.
Agent: So apologies for that. Just give me [TIME-3] here.
Agent: So from an analytics perspective, one of the options available to you are AI driven analytics here. So again, an opportunity for you to tap into [PRODUCT-4] driven insight here.
Agent: What you're seeing on your screen is a high level dashboard of the different areas that our [FAC-1] can help surface up insights for you. So we're looking at our broader database here within the specific dashboard.
Agent: From an insights perspective, this is all running behind the scenes for you and in terms of areas that are [PRODUCT-4] is surfacing up insights for you That could be our broader database, how likely are they to engage with an email Are they highly likely?
Agent: Are they loyalists to our email or are they least likely ?
Agent: This is a way to start to see how your broader database is trending in terms of your different channels, and specifically with email and things like push notifications. Some insights around when to send those ad hoc communications.
Agent: You know, what days of the week, time of day is most effective to send out our communications. Insights around our broader database level of saturation.
Agent: So this is a quick at a glance view to start to see, are we oversaturating our constituents with communications?
Agent: That we start to see, you know, most of our database leaning into that saturation category, saturated category, excuse me. You know, that's a moment.
Agent: For us to take a pause, revisit our strategy and ensure that we're not over-communicatin g with our constituents there . [ORG-30] can also surface up insights for you around your subject lines.
Agent: You know, how are things like punctuation, specific phrasing, tones, how does that impact our email engagement?
Agent: Um, insights around [PRODUCT-2] selection.
Agent: So if you're reusing sort of imagery or specific banners across different email communications, our [PRODUCT-4] can help you understand what are those high performing banners that high performing imagery that's actually leading to certain actions for that our constituents are taking in there.
Agent: So for that next communication, you know, perhaps you want to use sort of our top performing banner that that's most effectively driving constituents across our holistic email sends .
Agent: The last bit I want to highlight for you from an [PRODUCT-4] driven insight perspective is anomalies. So throughout [DATE-16], you're gonna have multiple email sends, multiple campaigns running simultaneously.
Agent: It may be difficult at times to really keep track of all of those campaigns and be able to intervene in a time-efficient manner here.
Agent: This is an opportunity to have our [FAC-1] actually flag anomalies for you across all of those different sends that you have that are running simultaneously.
Agent: That could be an unusually high unsubscribe rates or a low open rates or the reverse Perhaps there's a [ORG-26] where we're seeing very high engagement Our AI is gonna flag those types of anomalies for yo u so that you can either understand and interven e in those broader campaigns that perhaps are underperformed .
Agent: So again, our [FAC-1] gives you those broader database level views. And let's go back here.
Agent: And what I'll last wrap up with from an analytics and reporting perspective are out of the box dashboards that are available with the platform itself. We'll give this a second to load here.
Agent: And what these are three built dashboards for you that are going to highlight your top level email performance here. So your usual deliverability analytics will give us a second.
Agent: Your high level view around engagement or open rates are clicked to open rates. Our email performance here. So looking at everything from a funnel perspective from send all the way down to clicks.
Agent: And we'll give this a second here.
Agent: And once this loads, you'll also be able to see sort of your top and bottom performing journeys as part of your different efforts here. So again, these are all pre-built dashboards for you. No need to customize these.
Agent: You know, you can drill down by specific dates, a specific business unit or workspace or a specific campaign that you're running within your particular business unit.
Agent: So a few different ways here to drill down into the effectiveness of your communications and really understand what's working, what's not working, so that we can optimize our efforts. I know that's a lot to cover here.
Agent: I'm going to take a sip of water, but if you any questions from an analytics and reporting perspective that y'all have.
Agent: What about any questions,
EndUser: Feedback, overall from what you all saw [DATE-1]?
EndUser: I think one of the things that I'm still would like to see is how would you make sure a publication was sent out, whether it's a search piece, a postcard, a flyer, a brochure. to know that it hit
Agent: On the track correctly and was sent out. Yeah, so that that's going to bring me back to our journey piece there. So.
Agent: I'm gonna make the, I remember you all mentioned, you have your in-house print, correct?
Agent: So that's where that adding individuals onto campaign is gonna help you build that list.
Agent: So if someone drops into that campaign that that's synced over to the [PRODUCT-3] there, you'll see who, at least within our journey, reached that step to receive a specific publication. That list ultimately would get shared out for you.
Agent: Your in-house print shop And
EndUser: In terms of track, are y'all tracking who was if someone received it or just that they were said something ?
EndUser: That they were sent something. We document that on the students rec students record
Agent: As well to make sure that then we pull them out of the next poll of that of that publication material. That it. Yeah, so I would say.
Agent: For customers that have that in-house print shop, we usually see them go this route where they add them onto the campaign on the [PRODUCT-3] side.
EndUser: And that kind of serves as your list of who should have been sent a publication. And that all surfaces
Agent: Back onto that contact record. OK. And so then it can be exported to the student record and then removed out of the campaign for the next cycle. Correct, yeah, so you wouldn't need to.
Agent: I'm assuming [PERSON-9] please correct me if I'm wrong here.
Agent: Are y'all displaying the campaign list, related list on the contact record [DATE-1]?
Agent: Yes, we are.
Agent: Okay, so because you're already doing that [GPE-4], you know, you wouldn't need to at least surface up who received what that campaign will be listed already for you in the contact record in terms of removing them from receiving that publication and sort of the next round.
EndUser: It's just sort of adjusting your filter logic there and sort of what list ultimately
Agent: Gets sent back to your to your in house. Perfect. Just wanted to make sure that we can still track that and keep an eye on it.
EndUser: Yep, and hopefully
Agent: This is one of those automated ways here where you're not comparing a lot of lists here. Thanks.
Agent: One of our feedback, do you have any other reactions or thoughts on you see ways for this to improve or you know, any initial thoughts?
EndUser: I mean, yeah, of course, because we all love [PRODUCT-1] and sales force in general. So I mean, yeah, I think we'll, I think next up for us definitely will be talking a little bit more in depth.
EndUser: And I know we've probably got a few things to iron out with, with IT and budget.
Agent: And I don't have any further questions, though, from this.
Agent: Well, I'll plan to sample back with you maybe in a couple
EndUser: Of [DATE-13] and see where things
EndUser: Stand and see how I can best support you on the floor.
EndUser: Is that sound OK?
EndUser: Yeah, I do have a question. I do have a question, [PERSON-2]. On the on. I know that you talked about different groups having a specific pay price in order to add different into different groups.
EndUser: Since admissions kind of does the whole journey all the way up until registration.
EndUser: So if we do so say that we also cover like new student orientation in our materials and we also cover housing information in our materials, both in print and in email and in text, that can just stay within our one journey correct or can can stay within our containment.
EndUser: I guess is what my question is like the. the
Agent: Pricing range. Like we wouldn't have to have different models for those as well. Correct. Yeah, even though it's different schools that you're potentially sending
EndUser: Marketing information to, you wouldn't need to list this unit. You could keep the containers how you do now. Okay.
EndUser: Well, I guess, [PERSON-9], on your end, is that similar to what we're going to do with the colleges, or do the colleges have to have their own individual ones as well if we decide to start helping them with their process?
EndUser: Because I know [ORG-34]Speaker 6: Kind of has their own, but would that be rolled into admissions since that's the secondary process?
Speaker 6: That's going to depend somewhat on stuff like whether or not you want to share [PRODUCT-2] with them. and stuff like that.
Speaker 6: If they're in the same business unit, you can share [PRODUCT-2] with them, which may or may not be a good thing. And whether, I mean, how much access they'll where
EndUser: Have to your stuff is kind of you'll make that decision and stuff. So it'll have to be a cost versus access kind of decision on that.
Agent: It could work either way. Okay. I just didn't know if we had that, if we had flexibility in that sense.
Agent: Yeah, that's definitely is up to you all on how you all want to give people access and in which units and what not.
EndUser: It. The architecture
Agent: That helps. Thank you.
Agent: Well, other questions.
EndUser: There's no early today and then I'll plan
Agent: We can cut it a little
Agent: To circle back
Speaker 6: To the group in [DATE-16] and check in and
EndUser: We can go from there. Thank you, [PERSON-2]. And Thank you.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs.
