voice_13888_167_0LQ3y000008Rfh8GAC,"EndUser: Good, how are you?
Agent: Hey, doing good. Hey, thanks for the patience there. We're problem solving on a [DATE-1], but making a hit. Well, thanks for being able to catch up. I really appreciate it.
Agent: [PERSON-1] spoke incredibly highly of working with you and your team, I think over [DATE-2]. So, you know, I'm hoping to make this transition really seamless for you guys.
Agent: Make it seem like there's really no disruption. And, um, really just kind of pick up where you guys left off and make this as easy as possible for you.
Agent: So, you know, appreciate you being open to connecting ahead of this conversation that we had scheduled on [DATE-3].
Agent: But I thought we could just start off with, you know, like quick intros just to kind of get to know each other a little bit better. And then just wanted to just chat through like immediate needs.
Agent: Like, is there anything I can help with right off the bat?
Agent: I know, [PERSON-1] and you were talking about a Service Cloud voice consultant. So, wanted to make sure that, you know, I know he had provided at least one recommendation.
Agent: I think he was going to follow up with another one, but wanted to make sure that there's, you know, if there's anything I could do to help out with that, make sure we could start there and then really just wrap with, you know, some ideas for, you know, future conversations, something top of mind that I think might be relevant for you.
Agent: So just wanted to get your take on it.
Agent: But I'll tell you that after quick intros, definitely want to take it over to you to see, you know, what else you would maybe want to cover so we can make the best use of your time [DATE-4].
Agent: That's okay.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Okay, perfect. Well, I'll be brief [PERSON-2], but [PERSON-3], I'm an account executive here at [ORG-1]. I sit right next to [PERSON-1]. So we've been teammates off and on for [DATE-5].
Agent: So I've known him for quite a while. So I'm still in the same group of [PERSON-2]. We formerly reported up to the same manager. I don't know if you had many actions with [PERSON-4].
Agent: He actually has been promoted. So a little bit more of a team change there.
Agent: We are getting a new, or I am getting a new manager as well who I'll make sure to get introduced to you and the team. She's actually coming externally and has not been onboarded yet.
Agent: She was a previous sales force employee though.
EndUser: Hi.
Agent: Not, you know, not new to the organization by any means, but we'll certainly get you guys introduced as soon as we can there.
Agent: But same as [PERSON-1], I live in [GPE-1], I live in one of the kind of outer line neighborhoods with my wife and my dog.
Agent: But yeah, really looking forward to getting to know you and, you know, diving in with the [PERSON-5] team and seeing where I can help out.
Agent: We'd love to, you know, I know based out of the [GPE-2] area, [PERSON-2], but we'd love to know a little bit more about you and. kind of your journey within FTL.
Agent: I see you started as an accounting executive and now are a lot more involved with [ORG-2], which is exciting to see a transition like that.
EndUser: So I've been with FCL for [DATE-6], and I actually started as a customer service rep. So I was just like bottom of the totem pole answering phones, and then I transitioned into marketing.
EndUser: And we did not have a designated sales force admin. And I found myself as the Marketing coordinator needing sales force support that we didn't have. So I just kind of had to figure it out.
EndUser: And then my husband and I moved. to [GPE-3] because he was stationed at [FAC-1] and I did outside sales for us then.
Agent: Mm.
EndUser: Still did some of the sales force stuff like I got my second certification when I was an account executive.
EndUser: And I was just kind of like the person that people ask questions to even though that wasn't officially my title.
EndUser: And then about two and a half years ago, they approached me and just said, we need some sales force, some internal sales force support. And we'd like to have like a designated admin. So now.
EndUser: That's all I do and I have an admin [PERSON-6] who's great that we just brought on [DATE-7] because we found our self-feeding even more for support internally.
EndUser: But we use very, we're pretty self-sufficient on the consultant side. We were very consultant heavy for a long time, except for service public.
EndUser: That's really our one kind of gray area that none of us have a whole lot of experience in. So we do our best and our best just isn't really good enough yet. Thank you.
Agent: I mean, Service Cloud Voice is certainly one that we would always recommend, you know, a consultant to be brought in even for, you know, teams that have, you know, multiple times more resources than you guys do.
Agent: But that's awesome to hear. And that's what drew kind of echoed as well, is that you guys are, you know, very self-sufficient, really leveraged accelerators from premier support to upskill you. And I know [PERSON-6] was brought on recently.
Agent: So often that you have some additional bandwidth as well.
Agent: As far as like any immediate needs, I know, you know, some of the highlights that you kind of shared with me was, you know, I know you guys recently renewed your contract end of [DATE-8].
Agent: So hopefully from like a contractual standpoint, you've got to feel like you're in kind of a stable spot there.
Agent: It sounds like there's a focus, you know, Service Cloud voice sounds like kind of priority number one is kind of what was relayed to me.
Agent: But there's also focus on a heavier usage of digital engagement and I think diving more into SMS capabilities in addition to the other channels that you can use digital engagement for and then I'm signed conversations insights for call coaching.
Agent: So those are kind of like the three like, you know, salesforce, like product areas, it's all they were focused on. Anything else that I maybe didn't cover with through or that has come up as a priority.
EndUser: I don't... So in digital engagement, we actually increased our spend there for outbound texting. So we do have, we actually tried to register a phone number probably [DATE-9], and it got declined because of our privacy policy.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: We are totally willing to change our privacy policy or like get our employees involved to like get us where we need to be there.
EndUser: But I'm fully expecting, I'm like in the middle of doing that again to try to get this number registered so that we can start using outbound messaging. But I fully expect some pushback there. You show your aware.
Agent: Oh, thank you.
EndUser: We're totally fine with making adjustments to what we need to adjust in order to be in compliance with [ORG-2] or whoever the network provider is or whatever they call that.
EndUser: That they use, but that's probably the only other thing is just kind of getting those numbers registered so we can be successful with that.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, no, thank you for the heads up. And I imagine, did you log like a [ORG-2] case to get that conversation going for, okay.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: So I'll just keep a tab on that.
Agent: But please let me know as you're getting pushback, if you sense pushback, more than happy to, you know, work through some other channels to make sure that we get you answers faster and get this resolved.
EndUser: Perfect.
Agent: Is that something that's been open for a while?
Agent: I keep you've been working on that for, A number of [DATE-10] now is a little bit more recent.
EndUser: We're actually waiting on something from us. I guess both of our numbers are. technically registered with another provider, but it's not a provider that we use anymore.
EndUser: So we have to get like an authorization letter thing that they can have the numbers.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So they're actually waiting on me on that. And I'm waiting on some of the other teams. But then we'll I'm sure as soon as they get that that's when I'll get the pushback of no so
Agent: Okay, well, hopefully not and we can get you guys up and running sooner rather than later. But yeah, just please let me know how I can be a resource to expedite some of that.
Agent: And like I mentioned, [PERSON-1] said you guys really leverage premier success while I believe in terms of using expert coaching sessions and leveraging those resources and I think you've had premier through the [ORG-3] upgrade that you guys made.
Agent: Back in [DATE-10]. So it's been [DATE-14] that you've had it.
Agent: So just wanted to ask like from your perspective, how do you feel you're being supported from [ORG-2] in your role and just the company in general?
EndUser: So I probably haven't done this money for me or fashion.
EndUser: Recently, as I should have and same with [ORG-4], not because it's not helpful, just because we've had so much going on that it's like a finger swim and like we're just like, keeping our heads above water right now.
EndUser: Um, I expect that to probably <inaudible> down a little bit, but I think we could definitely.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Definitely kind of dive back into some of that. Um, I think I did like the service card voice premiere session. They told me one time they pulled it up one time, like everything I'd done and then I was.
EndUser: I can't see that on my end. So I was like, I believe you.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But we have some issues with support sometimes depending on what it is, where we log cases. And for whatever reason, so we have unlimited, but we have sales and service cloud.
EndUser: And Sales Cloud is the Unlimited cloud, but we also have service cloud. But because of how it's set up, some of the functionality is like, configured differently.
EndUser: Then it would be if we just had [PRODUCT-1] and no service cloud.
EndUser: So we run into support issues a lot with that where like what we think we should see isn't there and it's because we're like Unlimited but we also have another cloud that's like kind of affected by that.
EndUser: So that's probably like what we need from [ORG-2] is probably better support but it's not a you or [PERSON-1] thing it's like the actual support team I guess.
Agent: Yeah, it was like they're not understanding that you guys have.
Agent: Like Service Cloud or support with service cloud?
EndUser: Yeah, we have like a, you said, conversation, it's like we had an issue with conversation insights, probably [DATE-10] where users weren't able to see what we expected them to see.
EndUser: And when we logged in to give permissions following the documentation, they just weren't there. Like it was like [ORG-2] didn't unlock the permissions that we needed for our reps to be able to see what they needed to see.
EndUser: So my admin and I troubleshoot. We formed it, we worked on it together. He spent [QUANTITY-1] of time on it, and then he logged a case with support.
EndUser: So what happened was he was kind of making headway, and then they passed it off to somebody else, and then they started over.
EndUser: So it's like these two sessions that we already went through all this stuff, we're doing again. Which happens a lot.
EndUser: It's like somebody doesn't know, so they pass it off to somebody that they think will know, and then you just do the same thing five more times.
Agent: Yeah, you're just kind of caught in the just still a little bit.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And the [ORG-5] issue that you guys were having, is that been resolved or is that still something that's ongoing?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So it's been resolved, however, what's supported as they went through and these just assigned like every permission we had to rep. And I was like, that's fine, but my reps can't have all these permissions.
EndUser: Like, it's fine if we're trying to trouble if you could see what's going to do, what, but like, you can just leave all these permissions on like all of these reps perviles because there's stuff that I don't want them to be able to do.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Right. Okay. So kind of a temporary fix, but you need to maybe undo some of that.
EndUser: Yeah, so we've gone back and like removed stuff that we know they shouldn't have.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And but the problem is then you have to go one by one and be like, okay, well, did this affect like?
EndUser: What we were trying to fix.
EndUser: Did this one us back what we were trying to fix?
Agent: Okay. Okay. That's frustrating. Well, appreciate your patience working through them with that. Glad something got resolved, but unfortunate. That sounds like it made a little bit of additional work there.
Agent: But, okay, well, if you are continuing to have issues with, just like working through support with the sales and the Service Cloud and maybe some confusion from their team on the SKUs, please again, just keep me posted.
Agent: Just, you know, lines of communication, you know, never feel like you can't reach out to me about something super small, like nothing too small for my attention and to see where I can help out.
Agent: And yeah, I mean just moving forward like call a text email whatever is easiest for you The number in my email signature is my style of my work style.
Agent: So Happy to engage in whatever channel is kind of easiest for you
Agent: And then outside of that I mean The only other question I had I mean I guess just looking ahead for like q1 in general Are there any I guess like [ORG-2] specifically, is there anything you're really focused on wanting to get knocked out within Q1 that I can try and help be aligned with?
EndUser: Okay. Let me pull out my plan for [DATE-18] really fast.
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: The biggest thing that we need to, so we formally had [ORG-6]. I don't know if you're told you that. So before [ORG-7], we actually had [ORG-6].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: We just had a major issue with support and it was very much a. We're pointing the finger at [ORG-2] when it's a talk desk to you.
EndUser: So, which is why we went native, you know, figuring that [ORG-2] has the solution.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And then now we've seen that in the next release that you guys are obviously going to have better support with [ORG-8] coming here shortly, which is great. But in Q1, we want [ORG-9].
EndUser: So, talk desk was really good about [ORG-9]. You just plug in like, hey, we want this message to go out every X amount of [DATE-10] when this number calls in.
EndUser: It's a little more complicated in [ORG-2], which is not necessarily a bad thing because they really want you to respect like opt-in and [ORG-10] and all of that, which is important, which I think talk to us just like didn't care or like maybe they pretended like they didn't care.
EndUser: I don't really know. But that's our big one is see that which we would like to lean on digital engagement for that. I realize it's [DATE-18].
EndUser: So getting the phone numbers registered is like we can't do that without getting those registered.
EndUser: So we are also, we just met with a survey company, until for survey is not the answer, we looked into that too, who's gonna let us do surveys for cases for CSAPs, like our big few one hall.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, that's probably the big one.
Agent: Okay. And when you say [ORG-9], just so we're kind of talking about the same thing here, is that a specific type of blended taste.
Agent: I know, you know, broadly, I know the term [ORG-9], but when you guys refer to [ORG-9], is that a specific type of client engagement that they might be calling in about?
Agent: Or is that just all, you know, case related inquiries that you guys kind of refer to as [ORG-9]?
EndUser: So it's actually, we've defined it as, so we have, I don't know how much you know about our business, we have, we work with contractors who then offer financing to homeowners.
EndUser: So we have a team that works with contractors who actually offer the financing and then a team that works with homeowners who actually have the loans with us.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So this sees that survey essentially would go out to any homeowner or contractor contact. So they're already like a contact in our system, not just a random person calling in.
EndUser: They would get a text message every X amount of [DATE-10] that they call. So, and then we also have it for case, which would be in an email format.
EndUser: And then we're also looking at like chat and other options, but that's kind of later down the road. But for Q1, we got to get one of them launched because we have nothing right now.
EndUser: We have it for about a little over a year. We just had no like radar of like customer satisfaction. So we just got to get something up and running by end of Q1.
Agent: Okay, so C-SAT, like when in your guys' world is really like those surveys, like understanding feedback on customer satisfaction.
Agent: Okay, and it sounds like currently you guys are able to do that through email wanting to expand that into SMS or is email not often running yet either. Okay.
EndUser: Emails that up and running yet either. We are like, we're in the process of like configuring both, but since it takes a while with like registering phone numbers and all that which we knew.
EndUser: They're kind of working getting work simultaneously.
Agent: Got it. Okay, so that is super helpful. I appreciate you walking me through that. And yeah, I spoke with through about the business, poured through the notes that you guys had, obviously done my homework on your website.
Agent: But anything that you feel like it might not be super obvious on the website or it might be unique to your business would love to hear that.
Agent: And if that's something for a later conversation and you want to think about it, that's totally OK, too. But yeah, my real goal here transparently, [PERSON-2], is I want to be really in the weeds as if I'm.
Agent: You know, an employee of FTL. So there's no, you know, needing to repeat, you know, how your business works, how a [ORG-2] solution might help you guys out.
Agent: You didn't need to be customers or the contractors or the homeowners. So that's my goal. So I'm just trying to get up to speed it this quickly as I can.
EndUser: I don't know that there's anything like, I mean, we all have nuances.
EndUser: We integrate with a lot of partners too, like we have a lot of partners that we, like a contractor, registered stuff, [ORG-10], and then, you know, they go to a homeowner's house and they're like, hey, I can't afford this or hey, I want to pay my plan.
EndUser: But we also, which is not super clear on our website, we have partners that send us applications to kind of like through a waterfall. And we do the same thing.
EndUser: So a lot of the finance companies have found that they get better results.
EndUser: If they kind of focus on a specific group of people, like so you either only do people with low credit or you only do people with good credit or you only do but people with not only, but you have a focus on people like in some kind of credit band.
EndUser: So we kind of fall in the middle. You're not like, while we can support financing for like super high credit people, we're kind of like in the middle.
EndUser: So probably like credit scores like six, 66 to 7.27-ish are kind of, but like in 958, our programs that we have are just not gonna be as appealing to you because you have like an insane credit score.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But we also, what we'll do is be a partner that we bring on when somebody's like below those thresholds of certain credit scores, and I don't know what it is now because I'm not underwriting, but.
EndUser: They just push them to partners, like automatically push them to partners, and like all of our partners also use [ORG-2]. We are not connected.
EndUser: I am very, very set on we will not be connecting our [ORG-2] to any of our partners because they just have terrible data.
EndUser: As we've learned, we've had a couple that have scratched [ORG-2] orgs because their data's been so bad. So I'm like, they're not going to be overriding any of our information.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: So that's probably what's not super clear is we're on a couple of different platforms and then our platform actually has a couple of different lenders outside of our needs to.
Agent: Ok, and so those partners that you guys might be pushing other. And these would be like prospects then that you guys would say, OK, these don't fall within our kind of ideal customer profile.
Agent: We're going to we're going to push this prospect to.
Agent: Another one of your partners, am I understanding that correctly?
EndUser: So we use opportunities as applications. So a contractor has an account like in [ORG-14], a contractor has an account with us, and then every time an application is submitted through that contractor, it's an opportunity.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Basically an opportunity for us to make money is how we look at it. And then if it doesn't fall within that credit being, we have API connections that our software engineers have custom built to just talk to.
EndUser: So they'll just go straight from us to be passed to like one of our five partners and then on the opportunity, it just says like past the partner.
EndUser: And then if that loan ever funds what happens is the partner pay us commission for each loan that they fund that they get through us and then same with us we pay partners commission based on loans that we fund that we get from partners.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay. Very interesting. No, I did not pick up on that through the website. So I appreciate you walking me through that.
Agent: And are these partner organizations, are they affiliated in any kind of legal way with FTO?
Agent: Or is it just a relationship that you guys have built with them?
EndUser: Nope, it's just a relationship. We have like a partner contract. But it's, I mean, they probably nobody you know, but it's like [ORG-10] is the big one and I know they use so forth.
Agent: Go.
EndUser: And my crop. Those are like some of the bigger ones.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And as it relates to working with these partners, like, is that anything that you're currently focused on improving the Workflow between the partners or, changing the amount of business and that mix of partner-based business versus organic business, just a curiosity.
EndUser: Mine is more so like coming up with the best ways to house and report on the data.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: You know, it's great that you have all these partners, but if you can't tell them what you're getting from them, which is where we run into issues with them is we give them exactly what they need and want.
EndUser: We don't get that back.
EndUser: Like they just don't have, I don't know, they just don't have the admin team or if they just don't have the know how of how to do certain things with sales work that we built.
EndUser: Custom objects and all sorts of custom stuff and we're available to report on this because we have a team that really understands sales force and I don't know if it's just like a lack on their side.
EndUser: But that's more so what we do like from the sales force side is like the custom reporting and all the stuff with the data.
Agent: Okay, just trying to make sense of data that might be coming in different formats or not the format that you guys would prefer to be in.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: Okay. Cool. No, I appreciate you. Welcome to that. That's super helpful to just kind of understand the landscape in general and how you guys find your clients.
Agent: And then one other question and I'm sure it's in the notes, but it's not something that I actually came across when you guys are Working with your customers.
Agent: Are you primarily getting leads from from contractors or is there ever a situation where you're interacting directly with the homeowner and then you're bringing in a contractor and making that in direction.
EndUser: We don't interact directly with the homeowner. All police come directly, leave being in your peak homeowners.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: All of those are through contractors because it's kind of like an indemnification kind of thing. So we don't want to tell somebody, hey, use this contractor and then something goes wrong with the contractor, it's a liability thing.
EndUser: We are actually working, that isn't our plan [DATE-18] as well. Some type of a solution because we do get that question, hey, I want to apply for a loan, but I don't have a contractor.
EndUser: And just reliability, we can't say, hey, use this contractor, but we're looking to potentially build either a custom tool, either on the field floor side or have our devs do it like on our website side that pulls up like a list of people.
EndUser: You know, within [QUANTITY-2] radius of wherever they are.
Agent: Mm.
EndUser: And then just say, these are all the people that are registered with us that are able to process a loan for you.
Agent: Ok, that makes sense.
Agent: So yeah, you guys, probably for legal reasons, don't want to be recommending a contractor, but you want to still make it easy for your customer, or a potential homeowner that reaches out to be able to find one.
Agent: Ok. And is that something that you guys are focused on right now is growing those contractor relationships or do you feel like you know you guys are fine with where you know the contractor relations are [DATE-4] and you're focused on growth through other areas.
EndUser: Yep.
EndUser: So we get all of our, I shouldn't say all, we get most of our contractors through distributor partnerships, which so a contractor is when that comes to your house and like install the equipment, they have to buy it from somewhere.
EndUser: So our outside team focuses on the distributors who actually sell the contractor's equipment. So they go to events to like meet new contractors or talk to existing dealers. So that's kind of our go to market for contractors.
EndUser: And then our go to market for homeowners is through those contractors.
Agent: Okay, okay, makes total sense. So these distributors are primarily making the introductions to the contractors or is where you find them.
Agent: So is growing those distributor relationships a priority or is it, you know, I know there's only a finite number and I think, you know, HVAC is a specialty of you guys.
Agent: There's only a finite number of large HVAC companies and I'm sure you guys have strong relationships with all of them.
Agent: But I'm curious, you know, is that also a strategy as well to continue to grow those distributor relationships?
EndUser: Yeah, so our field team like, basically only does distribute your events and then we'll have distributors that are like, hey, I have a new guy here's his name and phone number calling in and registered.
EndUser: There's like, tens of thousands of contractors and we finance nationwide. So our field team travels nationwide. But as we have like 22,000 contractors in our database about 5 to 6,000 of them are active [DATE-18].
Agent: Cool.
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: Like actively working with us [DATE-18].
Agent: Ok, cool.
Agent: And is there a goal?
Agent: Do you guys have a goal in mind of, by [DATE-18], you want to have X amount of contractors acted that you're working with or X amount of growth and distributor relationships?
Agent: Or is it more like dollars and cents based that you want to just grow out of?
Agent: Loans that you funded.
EndUser: Um. It's both. So I would say the bigger one of dollars profits the big one, but you don't get those dollars without bringing on new business. So there is a number.
EndUser: I want to say it's like 1477 or 945 you caught up and we get contractors like organically from those distributors and then we also get contractors through partners as well. So when I say 10 to 945 that's come.
EndUser: That's like At scale only like we're not getting you from a partner. But I don't know.
Agent: Okay,
EndUser: I don't have those exact numbers in front of me, but We have them.
Agent: So that goal is strictly through the distributors that you guys are finding those relationships yourself.
EndUser: Distributors, and there's some like larger events that we go to as well, like big contractor events that we'll get some stuff from, but it's primarily distributors.
EndUser: Occasionally they'll [ORG-18] like financing for contractors and we'll get some people that way. And we've just recently started doing stuff on like [ORG-18] and [ORG-18] and stuff. because our Marketing kind of segued into that.
Agent: So cool.
Agent: Ok. Awesome. No, this is this is super helpful, [PERSON-2].
Agent: I appreciate you playing 18 questions with me, but it definitely helps kind of put into context all the things that you guys are working on and everything you're focused on.
Agent: So if I do have more questions in the future, hopefully you will be patient with me again.
Agent: Because yeah, I think that's just the best way that I can be a resource to you is just by knowing how you guys are using the tool and how it can help you out.
Agent: I know we've got [TIME-1] left, [PERSON-2]. One idea that I had for the next conversation, I know we have time on [DATE-3]. I actually can't make that [DATE-3] because we have a mandatory in-person training on [DATE-3].
Agent: I thought it was something that I'd be able to step out for, but it sounds like today I was actually off [DATE-18] and I found out [DATE-4] that we can't.
Agent: But I was wondering if you would be open to doing like a [DATE-18] release. kind of recap. It sounds like you've already spent some time looking through the [DATE-18] release notes.
Agent: Merrily, if you worked with her in the past, she's still my solution engineer. She's awesome.
Agent: And I don't know if she's done this with you guys in the past, but just kind of distilling those [DATE-18] release notes or the release notes, just because as you know, there's a fund out there.
Agent: Is that something that you find value in [DATE-22] or maybe early next?
EndUser: Yeah, she did you that for us. And I think [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-1] were actually in the office and she did it remote, which was kind of weird, but she did do it once and it was really helpful.
Agent: Okay, awesome. That's great to hear. So yeah, really, the training is until [TIME-2] on [DATE-3]. So it looks like, let me see what [PERSON-8] calendars looking like, but yeah, anytime after that one o'clock,
Agent: Or [DATE-27], or [DATE-27] or [DATE-27] would work for us.
EndUser: I look like I'm completely open [DATE-27] and anything. I actually got a conflict anyway at 10 on [DATE-3], so it kind of worked out. So anything outside of after 10, I think, I'm good on [DATE-3] and then [DATE-27].
EndUser: And then if we need to push [DATE-27], I have some time on too.
Agent: Okay. Um, with like [DATE-27] at [TIME-3], central work for you.
EndUser: Mm-hmm, yes.
Agent: Okay. Cool. I, um, I'll go ahead and add her and update that invite. Um, let me make another fact. But yeah, other than that, uh, [PERSON-2], it was, it was really great to meet you.
Agent: Again, I'm, I'm thrilled to be working with you guys and helping you guys to continue to grow sales for us and have it meet the needs of the business better and support you.
Agent: So, um, So we already have the recurring sync on the calendar, so I think we're good there.
Agent: And then yeah, the only other thing I wanted to mention is I'm definitely going to be trying to make a trip out to [GPE-2] in [DATE-27].
Agent: So it would be great to meet you and some of the other folks on the team as well at that time.
Agent: Nothing that I have a date on or that we need to land on quite yet but just wanted to let you know. So if there's any date that you know for sure wouldn't work, I can work around that.
Agent: If there's any vacation coming up. No spring break is coming up here in [DATE-27] for a lot of folks. But other than that.
EndUser: I like no work take my creation, which is like really bad. But I know our field team has a lot of travel coming up.
Agent: Don't like to hear that.
EndUser: So like if you wanted like [PERSON-9], our president and stuff, I would probably mostly working around his calendar.
Agent: Ok, well, I'll once I get some more defined times locked in and get some alignment with leadership. I'll definitely reach out and see when might work for you guys and we can try to coordinate around that.
EndUser: Okay, perfect.
Agent: Cool. And then we'll ask questions, [PERSON-2].
Agent: Sorry, I know we're running along, but in terms of getting in touch with some of the other folks that are involved with [ORG-2], what's kind of the best way you feel to engage with them?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Are they pretty open to just a quick email introduction?
Agent: Some folks better to call.
Agent: What would you suggest?
EndUser: That's probably the best way. Specifically for [PERSON-9], if you go list in [PERSON-10], I don't know if [PERSON-10]'s on your list or not, she's our VP of operations.
EndUser: She's actually getting ready to go on maternity leave here in [DATE-27].
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So she'll be kind of out there for a little while. And then we do, we have like a Marketing point of contact to you, but I know that's probably most of your part.
EndUser: I don't know who replaced [ORG-18] or part-out person, but it would be dealing with marketing, obviously.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, it should be my colleague [PERSON-10]. We've kind of switched a little bit around about the alignment of how we support [PERSON-14]. But yeah, can definitely get him introduced.
Agent: Who is the Marketing point of contact?
Agent: And I can just let him know.
EndUser: It's [PERSON-10].
Agent: Okay. And as far as like an introduction for the [PERSON-14] contacts, we do want to be included in that as well.
EndUser: Yes, please.
Agent: Okay, absolutely.
Agent: Okay, awesome. Well, I know we're running along here, [PERSON-2], but again, super great to meet you. I'll get that invite out for [DATE-27] and we can review the [DATE-18] release at that time.
Agent: But hopefully you have a great rest of your day and please let me know if there's anything I can help with.
EndUser: Yep, I will. Thank you.

voice_14171_167_0LQ3y000007ucq8GAA,"Agent: Hi, yes, is this [PERSON-1] over at [ORG-1]?
EndUser: Yes, sir.
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-1], this is [PERSON-2]. I'm from [ORG-2].
Agent: How are you [DATE-1]?
EndUser: I'm doing great, doing great. [PERSON-3].
Agent: Good, good, good. We had a meeting scheduled for [DATE-1] from 2 to 1.8144921097543502.
Agent: It's now still a good time, or do we need to perhaps reschedule?
EndUser: No, sir, no, sir. This is fantastic.
Agent: Okay, perfect. Well, thank you so much for agreeing to have a conversation with me [DATE-1]. I was able to get some good notes from your previous conversation that you had with my colleague [PERSON-4].
Agent: But the purpose of this conversation is to really dive deeper into this note to get a better understanding of what it is you're looking for.
Agent: Not only from [ORG-2], but from a [PRODUCT-1] perspective, and then from there, we'll figure out some next steps in what we could do to really, you know, hopefully get this done.
Agent: So first and foremost, [PERSON-1], wanted to know what is your role over at VGL?
EndUser: I'm a partner.
Agent: Partner of the company?
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And what does VGL stand for?
EndUser: Video game lottery terminals. VGL, video game lottery.
Agent: Video game. Okay, perfect. And if you don't mind telling me just in your own words, you know, a couple of sentences or a few, however you would like. Just a quick business overview.
Agent: What is VGL?
EndUser: What VGL is we are licensed through the state?
EndUser: To provide game equipment to people who are licensed, licensed holders for [ORG-3].
EndUser: And so what we do is we are one of, would have only a few licensees in the state that can provide the equipment to locations, whether it be convenience stores, truck stops, bars, restaurants, whoever.
EndUser: Whoever has a lottery license. We provide the equipment for the game terminals, and we service that equipment. It's our equipment, and we service it The locations receive a portion of the revenue. We receive a portion of the revenue.
EndUser: And naturally, the state receives their tax money.
Agent: We received a portion and the tax and the state received the tax money.
EndUser: Yes, yes, sir. It helps them with their K through, K through 11th grade education funds.
Agent: Yes, it helps with the K-11 education fund. Yep. Second there. Okay, beautiful. Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate that.
Agent: Now, something I wanted to also touch up on, and I didn't know if this was the company or if it might be what you had just mentioned. But in the notes, it said multiple companies and locations.
EndUser: So it's Yes, we do it in different states. We do it. We do it. I mean, I mean, VGL is primary, primarily [GPE-1], but we do this same exact business in other states.
Agent: Okay, that business and other states. Okay. And so with the purpose of a CRMB to be able to manage and track what you're doing in all states outside of [GPE-1] as well.
EndUser: Yes, yes.
Agent: Okay, so we would want to track all activity across the country, essentially. Okay. All intravity in the country.
EndUser: So I guess I might have confused them because I didn't know if we should have separate systems or if possible there could be one system that covers everybody or sub-sub systems.
EndUser: I didn't want to make it confusing because it would help management and tracking because some of the same management tracks, you know, all different areas.
EndUser: But it's predominantly for service and installations is what we're looking forward to the help in.
Agent: Well, I can tell you this. So you can manage everything in one [PRODUCT-1] and with permission sets, workflows, customization specifically.
Agent: You can be able to manage the, like just for hypothetical reasons, let's just say you work in your business, does [GPE-1], [GPE-2] and [GPE-3], because I know you could pay the water either.
Agent: So you can have it to where just in one [PRODUCT-1], where we can have all your [GPE-1] information in one place, your [GPE-2] and your [GPE-3] information, but all still within the same org.
Agent: You would not need three different CRMs for each different date, unless that was something that was very specifically asked for. But that can be done all in one [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: That is fantastic. I was just asking because I didn't know, but that would certainly be much simpler and easier for people monitoring different areas.
Agent: Yes. So
Agent: If you can get to the lottery, yes. We're able to. No, completely agree.
Agent: And I think too, what will definitely be able to help you and your business and also other employees at the business be able to see and understand this vision is by having a deeper discovery with my solution engineer.
Agent: That will be something we'll plan for after this call is.
Agent: Is wrapped up, but typically whenever I deal with customers that work in areas outside of their own city or state, being able to have that conversation on a deeper level, a deeper technical level will hopefully give you guys, you know, the confidence in knowing what we can do by explaining maybe even showing you some visuals of our screen share.
Agent: Again, that will be in another meeting that will definitely make sure we schedule, but just to kind of give you a heads up of what we'll be able to do as we continue these conversations.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: And can it be separated in the event I wanted to use, I guess you could do both, because sometimes these sales guys do get involved with these service guys because they're really, and a lot of times these to be a collaboration between the sales guys, they're out there selling it and the service guys are installing it, so there needs to be some collaboration on both their ends.
Agent: Energy directions?
Agent: So.
EndUser: So I guess I get the, yeah.
Agent: Yeah. And yes, and so let me ask you this.
Agent: How many sales guys do you have?
EndUser: Ah, let's see, we have probably maybe seven.
Agent: Sales reps and how many service reps do you have?
EndUser: Maybe 21.
Agent: So we can have it where you have just your sales reps have access to sales cloud, which would be the sales main focus tool.
Agent: And you can have it to where your service reps only have licenses to service cloud, which will be help managing and your managing the services on the equipment. So anything like customer service tickets, knowledge articles.
Agent: Having Case Management as well, you can have it to where we separate your sales reps and your service reps in one org.
Agent: Or if some of your sales reps and service reps do the opposite side as well, you can have them on the same type of license. But typically we do recommend.
EndUser: Yeah, I think it'd be better for them to be on the same type because sometimes.
EndUser: Sometimes the sales guys after they sell something, they're not, you know, they, you know, they are supposed to follow up with their locations, make sure everything's, you know, going smoothly, they're happy, you know, all that good stuff.
EndUser: And sometimes they're not aware of when some of their clients have service issues. So, so, you know, because it is separated. So, so it kind of needs to be a little.
EndUser: You know, together, together I think, and that would allow them to say, know that, okay, this client has been having an issue with [ORG-4].
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: No, and you can also, we also have the ability to do internal communication where your service and Sales rep can talk to each other on an opportunity or on an account or on a client profile. A client profile.
Agent: And so if your sales guy does sell something and they want to know what is going on with the service side of the project, they can at mention a particular service rep that has been assigned to get an update on that specific service project or need for that customer.
Agent: There's definitely different ways you can go back.
EndUser: Very good.
Agent: But just wanted to make sure I knew how to do that.
EndUser: Very good. That's not like you guys. This is not true. I'm not. I'm not asking anything out of the, uh, out of the ordinary. Yeah, sounds like you got.
Agent: No, definitely not. Yeah, so far so far I'm not sensing anything that we can't do.
Agent: It's just going deeper into these beginning notes so that way I have a better understanding of, you know, what it is you are looking for because I did see that you were interested in service and sales capabilities and tools which we definitely have.
Agent: And we would be able to keep yourself separate from your service reps but also be able to have them communicate with each other, especially for that example that you just gave.
EndUser: For new installs and stuff like that and to put notes in there of certain requirements that each customer and right require before they go out to the location. That would be perfect.
Agent: Yep, exactly. Next question.
Agent: So other than you, [PERSON-1], would there be any other decision makers that we need to bring into this conversation?
EndUser: No, sir. No, sir.
Agent: Nope. Okay. Next. So you, [DATE-1]'s, you see.
EndUser: It's just me and my partner. He, he, he, he, he don't want to be bothered with it.
Agent: You, okay. You. I'm sorry. No worries. Next question, [PERSON-5]: When are we looking on making a decision by?
Agent: So are we trying to do something by [DATE-2], going before the summertime?
Agent: What are we thinking?
EndUser: We're ready to move forward with this. I guess I contacted it because I kept getting this free trial version, but I don't know if this free trial version is going to work for me.
EndUser: And then I called to see what everything was about in this trial version, but started talking to the gentleman and I said, well, I would hate to use this for a trial version and then find out that it's not affordable.
EndUser: I said, so that's when he said, well, I need to probably put you in touch with a rep and you learn more about it and then he can provide you the cost associated with the product.
Agent: Yeah, for sure. I mean, we'll definitely talk about budget at high level. That will give you one of my questions.
Agent: Are we trying to stay with any particular budget when it comes to adopting a new software?
EndUser: I really have no idea what this cost. So I really wouldn't know how to. how to begin to budget for it because we've just never used the emails and texts.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: So we email and text everybody. But somebody, we hired some of some other texts and they had worked on this [ORG-2] app and it's spoken very highly of it. And that's what got my interest.
EndUser: And it is because their previous employer was using your app, and I said, well, maybe that's something that I need to investigate.
Agent: Right. No, for sure. I think having a [PRODUCT-1] tool is definitely going to help any business, no matter what industry or sector that they're in. Because at [DATE-3], most of every business has sales.
Agent: They need to track and manage KPIs that they want to hit [DATE-4] gold quota for [DATE-5].
Agent: And being able to have tools to be able to provide that information for you and where your business is, you know, in [DATE-6] specifically, that's where [ORG-2] could help to come into play.
Agent: So this is definitely a good first step in expanding the business of VGL out for [DATE-7] and honestly in the future. But going back to what you just said, you said we email in tech.
Agent: So is that your ways of communicating with your clients right now is with just over email and tech?
EndUser: Well, you email text, you know, then certainly, you know, call the old, good old fashioned voice cell phone call, you know, call everybody, but, uh, But yeah, but a lot of times, you know, we have to pull somebody in to sometimes do a three-way call and do a group text.
EndUser: So yeah, we do group text and
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Emails. Those are the two predominant ways.
Agent: And who do you guys use for emailing?
Agent: Is Outlook or Gmail?
EndUser: We have our own system, our own sort of [ORG-5]. It's like I'm... i'm [PERSON-6] my mind my company when is [PERSON-7] Oh, okay.
Agent: Because I did see that we were given that the [ORG-6] was your personal.
EndUser: That's my personal a no yes sir
Agent: Okay, but you do you do have a business email.
Agent: What's that business email?
EndUser: Uh... [PERSON-7] Amy.com.
Agent: Okay, perfect.
Agent: Is that is that backed by [ORG-7] or Outlook?
EndUser: You know, I don't even know. I would have to ask our IT again.
Agent: Okay, no worries.
EndUser: I don't even have a clue. And I'm still in reality.
Agent: Let me ask you this.
EndUser: You know, I should, but I don't know.
Agent: No, it's fine. It's all good. And let me ask you this.
Agent: How are you guys currently tracking?
Agent: How are you managing your business?
Agent: Is it on [PRODUCT-2] spreadsheets?
Agent: Like, how are you figuring out where your numbers are [DATE-1]?
EndUser: You know, through [PRODUCT-2] spreadsheet, you know, through our accounting department.
Agent: Okay, for a set date. And so as far as having the current.
EndUser: But all of our machines are online through a company, an online site controller that is done by [ORG-8] Introlot is one of the largest monitoring companies out there in our industry.
EndUser: So [LOC-1] provides us their system, which they provide it to the states, that they're contracted. by the stage to monitor all, well, that's really accounting purposes for the money.
EndUser: So it doesn't really help us in the service aspect, but monetarily it tracks every penny that goes in the equipment.
Agent: So if I were to ask you what is your current company's tech stack, so like what third-party software and solutions you guys use, it would mainly be [PRODUCT-2] spreadsheets and emailing.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Okay, perfect. All right, great. And you are brand new to what a [PRODUCT-1] and [ORG-2] is, because it was recommended to you. And that... Okay, great. So let me see this.
Agent: You're looking to automate [DATE-8] tasks and improve productivity. You want to optimize your sales work-close for efficiency.
Agent: You want to have a more centralized location for all of your data to have easier access and to have it all managed, easier. Check, check, check. So let me ask you this, [PERSON-8]Agent: What, has there been anything that's come up in discussions lately, especially, you know, on what are some pain points, what are some obstacles that the business is currently, you know, going through that also came into the conversation about [ORG-2]?
EndUser: Well, well, you know, you know, sometimes, you know, we use a, I guess, well, what is that company called [PERSON-9] or something?
EndUser: Yeah, I think, you know, the answer is calls to, you know, service tech calls.
Agent: Jake..
EndUser: And so, so there's, there seems to be some kinds of, it comes into the sales, the service guy's email, and then he disperses that call out.
EndUser: So sometimes there's some lag time between those calls coming in from our service line, because [PERSON-9] does provide us a live voice person [TIME-1] a day.
EndUser: You know somebody can they can always talk to a live in person uh... you know explain their situation what their technical issue is and then and then uh... and then ruby sends it to our you know that particular office and then and then that's when a text and uh... email goes out to the service rep service that No.
Agent: So it's okay, so that might be another question. So how you are currently managing your service side of the business is through this third party service called [PERSON-9].
EndUser: Well, it's just, we just, yeah, we just contract through [PERSON-9], which I don't know, it sounds like you maybe have never heard of them.
Agent: Yeah, I'm not picking [PERSON-9] now.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, it's just basically, you know, when you call VGL, you get a live voice, and it's just the live [PERSON-9] sales rep. Sales sales, you know, they provide a service that they enter the service tech line.
EndUser: So that way, you know, any of our customers are always assured that they're going to get a live voice. Someone there that's going to that they can explain their service issue.
EndUser: And, and then they will they will pass that service issue on to to our sales to our service rep.
Agent: And so for your service reps, whenever they get a service that needs a service issue, where is that?
Agent: Is that all managed in [PRODUCT-2]'s Freshies as well?
EndUser: Yes, yes.
EndUser: Well, yeah, it comes back in what they do is they come back in, send in an email as to what the problem is and then we have a, our secretaries then they put it in our system and into like [FAC-1].
Agent: Put them to a Google Drive and then from there the service rep, what happens from there?
EndUser: From there, I can log into it. My partner can log into it. Any manager can log into it and just check that log. [ORG-9], what happened [DATE-9], what calls were made and so on.
Agent: So all conversations, notes, photos, documentation around this service typically would be in [FAC-2].
EndUser: Yeah, that's usually how we do it. And then different people, everyone accesses that [FAC-3] and can check the information there.
EndUser: We also put in there, when we install equipment, we log it in with the serial numbers, what the equipment is, what the type of equipment it is, and so on. We log it into that same [FAC-3].
Agent: The
EndUser: If we put 6 or 7, pieces of equipment in there, we put the software type, the serial number of that device, and so on, all in that same system.
Agent: Okay, perfect. Let's see here.
Agent: And is it safe to say that the only way that you're able to get the service issue request is through this call line?
Agent: There isn't like a contact me form on your website or anything.
EndUser: No, no, there isn't. They, you know, right now they just, they just call that service line.
Agent: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so the service line is how you gave your service request.
EndUser: So you're saying if they went online, just went to a site and submitted it online, is that what you're basically saying?
Agent: Yeah, there's different ways. I mean, there's different ways that you can, you know, get a request for service. I mean, think about like your apartment complex, for instance.
Agent: There's always like a portal that the residents can log in and submit their request through that way. That's always an option.
Agent: There's always a service email address that you could use so that way you have a service inbox folder for your service reps. You go into that, into that email and.
EndUser: Well, that's good.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, some of our customers probably would love that. I mean, like anything, but some of them are old guys like me.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I'm [DATE-10]. I like which I guess we're kicking and screaming into the new age here. I tend to like a live voice, but I do know. But I know exactly what you're saying.
EndUser: There are a lot of folks that would rather do it online and be done with it.
Agent: Yeah, because there's ways to where if let's say we had like a live chat feature on your website and let's say it was like a very minimal issue that can be resolved with an article.
EndUser: Um.
Agent: You know, we can have it to where you can have it to where this chat feature would send that client of yours, an article for a very easy issue to be resolved without having to wait for, you know, [TIME-2], you know, call from your service rep when it could easily be resolved in [TIME-3], depending on what it is.
EndUser: Sure, sure, sometimes, sometimes, if they could see what the issue is, they could call and maybe walk that person through the issue over the phone in, you know, [TIME-4] after it comes in, you know.
Agent: There's different options.
Agent: Yeah, exactly. So there's definitely options that you can go about if you want to expand your ways of getting service requests. It's not just through the phone. Like I mentioned, there's having an email address.
Agent: There's having a live chat feature on the website. There's having just a contact me form on the website as well. There's different options. We could definitely explore those as well as we continue these conversations after [DATE-1].
Agent: But just to give you some more insight on what we can do with [ORG-2].
EndUser: That's very interesting. Yes, that's something that we don't do now.
Agent: Let me ask you, now on the sales side, for instance, all right, so the sales side, you've got about seven reps you said, how long would you say a typical sales cycle is?
EndUser: Well, what do you mean before when they contact maybe a potential customer?
Agent: Yeah, so like, let's say I live in [GPE-1], I own a gas station and I want to go to the to put a lottery machine in my gas station because I own the rights.
Agent: You know, from that first point of contact to being introduced to signing the paperwork and the machine equipment is coming to my gas station, how long do you think that typically takes?
EndUser: Yeah, I would say on average four [DATE-9].
Agent: [DATE-11], okay.
Agent: Four to six months average, right?
Agent: Cool. And when it comes to, I guess, the average cost of your deal and projects, is it just based on... the equipment itself and how many equipment or are there more details to go into that as well.
EndUser: Uh... it's usually just i mean i mean it i mean it does doesn't cost the custom you know the locations any money dot to the pro service but uh... but each uh... but every time we set a location it usually cost us [MONEY-1] Right.
Agent: So each Is that the gas station location?
Agent: It's paying you VGL $[MONEY-2]?
EndUser: No, no, no. I'm talking about usually the equipment that we place. in their business. That's usually on average the cost of the equipment going in to their business.
EndUser: It doesn't cost them any money for us to provide them the equipment. Like I said, they just get a portion of the profits.
Agent: So let me ask you this, how does [ORG-10] make money?
Agent: How do you guys get revenue?
EndUser: We receive a portion of those profits.
Agent: Ok, so the portion of the process, the portion.
EndUser: There's three people, there's three people, there's three entities that receive a portion of the profit.
EndUser: The state receives a portion, the business owner of the physical address where the equipment is located, and then us, VGL for providing the equipment to that business owner.
Agent: Okay, for providing the equipment. Okay, we receive a portion of the process. Okay, the state business owner where the equipment is located at, and then VGL for providing the equipment. Okay, so three entities. There you go.
Agent: And so you guys would want to, I guess, you know, say to say you would want to make sure you manage, interact. VGL's portion of the profits.
EndUser: Well, no, no, we don't need to worry about any of that because all that is done through the interlot system that I mentioned to you because the state controls the revenue.
EndUser: The state, you know, [ORG-9] is contracted by the states. Okay, so they're site controllers that monitor, that we connect to their equipment.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Okay, and then the store or business deposits those funds into a lottery account. That is, that is specifically set up. that the state goes in and [ORG-11] is the Revenue from that business owner's account.
EndUser: They take the money out of that business's account, and then they send us our money, the state does.
Agent: Okay, there we go.
EndUser: But all the tracking and everything is done through that [ORG-9],
EndUser: Controller system,
EndUser: And then they monitor all revenues And then the state sends us our portion, you know, after it's collected from the business owner, after the state, you know, the state collects not just their portion, but they collect our portion and sends it to us.
Agent: Okay. Got that. So let me ask you [DATE-16].
Agent: What are we looking to do with the service side with a [PRODUCT-1]?
Agent: So just so you know, a [PRODUCT-1] is a customer relationship management tool.
Agent: So we pretty much provide you the tools for your sales side of the business, your service side, and even your Marketing side of the business to help with the business overall.
Agent: So on the sales side, that's tracking and managing reports and dashboards, [ORG-16] metrics, having a place to know where you are at each other. deal cycle, so like what stage are in specifically.
Agent: I mean, there's many different ways that our sales tool can help.
Agent: By wanting to know, was there anything specific that you are looking to help on the sales side or at least improve on the sales side?
EndUser: No, no, I mean, I mean, basically the sales guys kind of handle that themselves.
EndUser: I mean, it'd be nice if we could receive a little bit more, rather than, you know, a little bit more up-to-date information as they make calls to see who they called on, you know, for [DATE-13] and log it in and, you know, meetings with this group, that group, I think that would be very beneficial to us as far as the sales side.
Agent: Okay, so then overall, I guess an overall question of [PERSON-1] is, you know, why [ORG-2]?
Agent: You know, what I have, I mean, obviously things are working well right now without a [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: I know that you were referred by one of your tech guys about [ORG-2], but, you know, what is it that mainly that you're looking for?
Agent: What are you looking to get from, you know, [ORG-2] overall when it comes to the business?
EndUser: Well, sometimes, sometimes, you know, things get lost. and the, you know, this guy didn't get an email or, you know, or a text or he wasn't included on this or didn't know about that.
Agent: Just a l
EndUser: It did, you know, and then other times it seems like some service guys are overwhelmed by people calling them or texting them, trying to find out what's going on, when they're going to arrive at this location, that location.
EndUser: And sometimes just, you know, everybody needs to kind of know what's going on, but it's sometimes burdensome to inform everybody or to keep everyone included that might, that might want either need to know or just want to know.
Agent: So you want to be able to essentially have a better way to have everyone in one place, and have a system where everybody can access everything in one place.
EndUser: Right and then you know you'll have you'll have uh... you know maybe one manager say well i did i didn't know i didn't know about you know this right in all about that right in [DATE-13] that was going there uh... you know you know and like i said sometimes the tech uh... may call one person that's aware of a situation tell them what he did and they're making a mission that email But sometimes it doesn't get to everyone that it might need to get to.
Agent: Mmm hmm.
Agent: Okay. Let's get zero.
EndUser: And then, like I said, I know we uploaded it into the system, but sometimes things are left out when you're dealing with third-party people, they sometimes put things in the short version and they may leave something out.
EndUser: It's always better to hear it from the horse's mouth. directly as to what went on rather than it being transposed.
Agent: So, would you say that you're looking for more improvement and help on the service side more so than the sales side?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Okay. More so. So, this is a more so of a more so of a heavy service side project, not so heavy on the sales side.
EndUser: Well, I mean, we need help in both areas. But in our business, we live and <inaudible> by our service. And the better our service is, believe it or not, that helps the sales side.
EndUser: In fact, that's the best way to improve the sales side.
Agent: So better our sales side would be.
Agent: Let's see.
Agent: And how many service issues, service projects, would you say your sales, your service guys have maybe like a week or a month?
EndUser: Oh, I don't, it's hard to say. That's very hard to say.
Agent: Oh, Well, you said you have about 17 service reps currently.
Agent: So are they like, like as of right now [DATE-1], are each of these managing more than, you know, one service request?
EndUser: Yeah, yeah. I would say each one does maybe [DATE-13].
Agent: Okay. Each service rep does that in [DATE-16]. Up in [DATE-16].
Agent: And is that determined on where they're located also?
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, that would be yeah, that would be in total. Yeah, different areas a
Agent: Has there been anything else that we haven't touched up on the sales or service side things that have just come up in the past, you know, [DATE-14], maybe from that conversation that you had with that tech guy about sale force.
Agent: Just as things that maybe you're looking for or things that we haven't gotten over yet.
EndUser: I No, not that I can come on. I think you've been very thorough.
Agent: Appreciate that. Definitely want to make sure I'm understanding the business as best as I can. Because I know that we have the tools to provide for you guys.
Agent: I just want to make sure I'm not over selling or underselling you. But what I will say is because I know we're coming up on time here.
Agent: So I do think the next best step is going to be getting a meeting with my solution engineer, his name is [PERSON-10]. Essentially what this is a about, it could be [TIME-5] meeting.
Agent: Typically we do 46 just so that way it is, we have it all the time that we can. to have a deeper technical discussion.
EndUser: I don't want to miss understand you.
Agent: Now, this would also be, go
EndUser: I don't really don't want to over complicate this thing.
EndUser: You know what I'm saying?
Agent: Ahead. No, this isn't over-complicating it at all.
EndUser: I mean, I want, I really just looking for something.
Agent: No, no, no. This is more so to help you out.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
EndUser: I'm just really looking for something that's very short, streamlines, you know, you know, just, just allows people to, you know, to, the main thing is that, that when that service, it, you know, request is done or even before it's even, they go out that everybody knows what is expected to be done.
EndUser: That's really my major objective here, but I don't want to make this more complicated than it already is.
Agent: No, no, no, no, this is what it be. This isn't making anything more complicated. This is to make sure you, the customer, understand what [ORG-2] can do.
Agent: Now, after this call is over, I'm going to send you some information, some demos that are surrounding our sales and Service Cloud solutions so that way you can start seeing right away the power of [ORG-2] and what our tools can do.
Agent: But because we have so many options, taking this next meeting with [ORG-13] will help us help you pretty much figure out, you know, what's the best route?
Agent: Should it be this one solution?
Agent: Should it be this solution based on their needs?
Agent: And also, just to give you and other members of your team the confidence of knowing, you know, what [ORG-2] can do.
Agent: So we take this next meeting so that way, you know, you and your other partner, or maybe even some of your service reps can come into this meeting. We get more information from you guys, deeper information as well.
Agent: And then also we can tell, you know, technically, how we can do these things.
Agent: But like I said, I'm going to be sending you information after this calls over with, but that next meeting we would definitely take that we just have a deeper technical understanding and we would also want you to bring in, you know, maybe your other partner or maybe a couple of your service reps.
Agent: So that we can get more insight as to what they're looking to do with it.
EndUser: Now my partner is [DATE-21] and he really doesn't want any part of this. He doesn't want anything.
Agent: No worries, no worries. We don't have to bring him in then.
EndUser: He said, I don't even like sitting in text. So he doesn't even want to carry a
Agent: No, I understand that. I understand that.
Agent: Well, it could definitely be just you or it could be you and, you know, like I said, a couple of your service reps as well, just so we can get more inside from their side of the business.
Agent: But what I'm going to do is I'm going to send you two emails and you're going to send them.
EndUser: Phone. I'm probably going to want a very streamlined.
EndUser: Version of your of your it sounds like a very streamlined version of what you guys offer sounds like you guys offer a whole bunch of stuff But i'm just i'm just getting the feeling that i probably don't need a lot of the stuff that you guys have
Agent: For sound like you guys. Mm-hmm.
Agent: Oh, and I don't think you will either. I have about two solutions that are pretty straightforward that I feel like would align with your business. You're going to be getting those after the call as well with those demos.
EndUser: Yeah, we might be too small of a company for you guys, you know, saying, you know,
Agent: That's not the case at all. In fact, our small, medium business side makes up [PERCENT-1] of our [DATE-22] revenue. And I've worked with customers that have only had three full-time employees. So your size of the business is...
EndUser: Because we're. I mean, we're so busy and so short handed and such a small company in general.
EndUser: That we don't have a whole lot of time for duplication or, you know, we just, we truly down and <inaudible>, you know, down and <inaudible>, you know, just, you know.
Agent: Yeah, no, I hear you. I hear you on the [PERSON-1], but listen, this is just again, this is gonna be your first time investing in actual technology software that's not, you know, contracted already through the state.
Agent: This would be an actual purchase for you in the business. So I would just wanna make sure, you know, exactly what you're purchasing. You know, I can send you the demo, of course, and the demo might look nice.
Agent: But once you get the product, you're not gonna really know where to start, you know, how am I gonna get my employees onto this platform?
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want to buy something that, you know, I don't want to, you know, maybe I need a tricycle instead of a tinspe.
Agent: Exactly. Exactly. So that is why I want to make sure that we are helping you understand what you would be purchasing before you sign any contract.
EndUser: Okay, yes sir, thank you, [PERSON-9].
Agent: Yeah, so you're going to be thinking, yeah, of course, you're going to get two emails.
EndUser: Uh,
Agent: Like I said, the first email is going to be all that information with those demos that I described. And then the second email is going to be times to meet with me and my [ORG-13] [DATE-17].
Agent: So just be on the lookout.
Agent: Do you want me to send those to the [ORG-6] or at the AppVGL Gaming?
EndUser: You can just say that to [ORG-6], that's fun. That's fun.
Agent: [PERSON-11], I will do that. [PERSON-1], you'll be getting the, the, the counter invite email first and then you'll be getting the second email a little bit later tonight.
Agent: But either way, you'll be getting all the information you need within [TIME-6].
EndUser: Thank you. Thank you, [PERSON-16]. Appreciate it. Appreciate it.
Agent: Of course, [PERSON-1], if you need anything else in the meantime, please let me know.
EndUser: Yes, sir.
Agent: But outside of that, I'll start working on my two emails and we will definitely talk very soon.
EndUser: Thank you. Bye bye.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-1].",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"Answer to this question is unclear.

voice_14348_167_0LQ3y000009spZGGAY,"Agent: From [ORG-1] and [ORG-2] County [ORG-3]'s force.
Agent: Do you have a second to chat?
EndUser: Yeah, I do. Thanks for calling me back. I appreciate it.
Agent: Yeah, no, no problem. I just heard that you were talking with one of our other representatives about what you guys were looking to do.
Agent: But maybe you could give me a little more insight and I can hear help steering the right direction.
EndUser: Yeah, sure. Let me just give you a little bit of insight into our organization to start with, because it's a little bit unique. And then I can talk a little bit about what we're trying to do.
EndUser: So as you mentioned, it's. We're within [ORG-4], which is within [ORG-1]. Our group within [ORG-5] is [ORG-6].
EndUser: So [ORG-6] is pretty unique in that although we are all federal employees, we are decentralized and we all work on university campuses.
Agent: Bye bye.
EndUser: All of us have... And since you work with government folks, you'll get this right.
EndUser: So while all of us have .gov email addresses, we primarily rely on our university email to do our business because our jobs are to sort of function as faculty members at universities. So it's really unique. It's a cooperative.
EndUser: Again, that's why it's called [ORG-7]. It's a cooperative between the university systems, the federal government, and then also state agencies as well. So again, all federal employees, we're not contractors, we're not.
EndUser: You know, part-timers or whatever, we are [PERCENT-1] federal employees, but we're all housed at universities, sitting in university buildings operating off of .edu accounts on a regular basis.
Agent: Okay, so question just one follow-up on that.
EndUser: So, yeah.
Agent: There's like the role actually at the university.
Agent: Like are you just helping them, you know, with different research programs?
Agent: Is it, are you a professor?
Agent: Like, I guess, can you just tell me a little more about how this group falls into the school?
EndUser: Yeah, we are full-fledged faculty members at the university.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: It is the short answer. What makes us different from other faculty members is, again, that we're paid by the federal government. But, you know, in most cases, if you were to walk into my office, you would not.
EndUser: There would be no way that you would know I was a federal employee, basically, unless I told you. So we're integrated with faculty. We teach courses. We advise graduate students. We mostly focus on graduate education.
EndUser: We don't do very much at the undergrad level.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So it's really a focus on graduate education. And the program has been around since [DATE-1]. So it's long lived. and has grown recently in [DATE-2].
EndUser: So we've got, I think, I think it's about 37 units around the country all at land-grant universities. We've added a few recently, which is why I'm not sure the exact number.
EndUser: And then each one of those units has usually three, but sometimes as few as two, or sometimes as many as four scientists.
EndUser: So we're talking about, you know, 128 scientists probably nationwide when we're fully staffed, which seems like we never, we never fully are.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And again, you know, just sort of this decentralized model where we're seeking to kind of create a community of practice so that it's just easier for us to communicate amongst ourselves.
Agent: And I'm sure you guys, [ORG-8] has been very successful across universities. So I'm sure you might already have senior students or other professors and faculty using [ORG-8].
Agent: Is that kind of how you heard about it?
EndUser: Oh yeah, no, my lab, so I'm in [GPE-1], we're at [ORG-9] in [GPE-1]. We started using [ORG-8] with an [ORG-10] unit, I don't know, [DATE-3].
EndUser: I think we were probably the first people in this department to start using [ORG-8] some other faculty about it since then.
EndUser: And we're on a pro plan, so it's not a ton of money, but we don't have a lot of people within our unit, and you're running maybe.
EndUser: At the most, you know, where maybe 12 or 14 people, so we can afford, you know, whatever, it's $[MONEY-1] a month, you know, within our program to sort of do that.
Agent: You
EndUser: So, yeah, so very familiar with [ORG-8]. I mean, I'm starting my Slack screen right now. It's open. It's open all the time while I'm at work.
EndUser: And I've used it for some other things I've been engaged with on a shorter term.
EndUser: And as I said, because we kind of had this interest in developing a community of practice, there were several of us out there who have used [ORG-8] in the university world.
EndUser: But when we first started thinking about this a better year ago, I was not aware that there, at that time, I was under the impression like, okay, well, we can't use [ORG-8] on government computers.
EndUser: We can't use [ORG-8] officially. So this would have to sort of be an unofficial community of practice.
EndUser: And so I realized I'm rambling a little bit, but we were leaning towards sort of like, okay, we'll just set up a free plan because there's so many people, you know, our agency isn't going to support this and pay for it.
EndUser: Our other option was [ORG-8], which nobody was interested in dealing with. And so I was sort of again looking into the free version of [ORG-8] to host these hundred plus people.
EndUser: And as i was scrolled through the page so i've you know go to black and but always at least calling us about that so that's one yeah so that's where we're at Yeah.
Agent: No, that's all. They use so much color. It's very helpful. Yeah. So, Gov. So Gov. [PERSON-1] is secured. So there's different permissions within Gov. Black. So, like, give it that full. It's only moderate [ORG-12]. It's not the [ORG-12].
Agent: I'd ramp high. If, if, like, you know, it's not means just different [ORG-8] standards. The government, like, requires, like. you know, of a lot of the technology they use.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: And [ORG-12] is like almost all of our technology is [PERSON-2] high and we're working on, I think [DATE-4] we should be getting [PERSON-3]. So it is very, you know, secure and safe.
Agent: And, you know, we actually just took out teams at the [ORG-15] to replace it with [ORG-8].
Agent: So, Yeah, right, but you know, just like, so it is what my point of sharing that is though, is that, you know, can use it for like with those, with that type of Security level.
EndUser: Nice. Good for you.
Agent: But, but it just, I guess, I question would be like, so is all 86 people you're talking out are those all those different scientists within these campuses?
EndUser: Yeah, right. So... So while we have some, so yeah, let me see if I can explain this a little bit better.
EndUser: Well we have a small staff that actually sits in a government building outside of [GPE-2] who function, you know, they're in a government building, government clearance, you know, in terms of getting in and out of the building, they're on their <inaudible>-gov email addresses [DATE-5].
EndUser: All of us who are at the universities, and actually, this might help a little bit too. I didn't think about this when we started. If you, um... Let me give you the email address or web address.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: If you go to, yeah, so it's www.one, the numeral one, not don't write it out, right?
EndUser: Www.onesgs.gov slash co-op units. So co-op units is [PRODUCT-1]: He's a co [PERSON-4].
EndUser: I'm sorry, so it's www.usgs.gov slash co-op units.
Agent: Oh, oh, okay.
EndUser: C is in CAT, O-O-P as in [GPE-3], [ORG-14].
Agent: Hey, guys.
EndUser: All
Agent: Oh, awesome.
EndUser: Right, so you're looking at a front page and there's a bunch of pelicans standing there?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yep, okay, right, that's what you're saying.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, okay, well first of all, that's my picture. I took that picture here in [GPE-1], so yeah.
EndUser: So anyway, but if you look at the map underneath it, you can kind of see all those dots, so all those dots are where we have people, right?
EndUser: And all those dots, except for the store, are on university campuses. So again, all these people are primarily functioning through a dot [ORG-18] email address.
EndUser: We do have dot gov addresses, but we only access those through a specific government machine. And most of us, to be honest, we go there once or twice a day at most, but we're on our dot edu.
EndUser: I mean, that's our bread and butter. And so we originally thought, like, okay, because we're all on dot edu addresses because we're all on [ORG-22].
EndUser: Functioning through university servers, you know, that we could just go with [ORG-8], it was over teams, which people would sort of prefer.
EndUser: And that, again, was kind of why we went, you know, on the journey to [ORG-8], and a bunch of us had used it before.
EndUser: But that's, and you can kind of look at a little bit more about the program when you have time to sort of see what it's about, but I think the map, I figure the map would help.
Agent: Yeah, I obviously I went more into the government and business side in school, but I looked at [ORG-14] environmental science at one point.
EndUser: Oh, nice.
Agent: And so this is awesome. I wish I had known about this type of work you guys were doing when I was in school.
EndUser: Yeah, it gets lost, unfortunately. And again, it's not. And even some of the environmental programs are a little bit different.
EndUser: And we tend to have people who focus really hard in fisheries or wildlife scientists undergrad to come in and be grad students.
EndUser: But still, yeah, it's a lot of work focused on on doing conservation work with fish and wildlife resources, and partnering a lot with state agencies, so with the here in [GPE-1], [ORG-22], or at the federal level with [ORG-18], or the park service, organizations like that.
EndUser: And again, the primary focus is on doing this research through graduate students.
Agent: Yes.
EndUser: And so, hence, like our [ORG-8] board, our [ORG-8] space, that's why we did it. And we've got... three scientists, we each have several, you know, a few graduate students. They were clearly, you know, very [ORG-8] able right away.
EndUser: And we just found it was a really great way to just, you know, kind of communicate with a bunch of different things that, you know, we could kind of move off of the email.
EndUser: And again, and so for us, for this program, you can see how scattered we are right by looking at the map. But yeah, we all have challenges that we're facing on a regular basis.
EndUser: So for example, some new policy comes out. and I'm sitting there going like, man, I don't kind of get this. And we don't have an easy way to communicate with ourselves. So I can't.
EndUser: I can't, you know, it's difficult for me to talk to a bunch of other people at one time about this, you know, without starting a long email chain.
EndUser: And so, again, some community of practice space seemed like a way that we could handle this, and, again, hence the thought about [ORG-8].
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: No, I mean, I answer things. Everything you're talking about like [ORG-8] is really made for us or bread and butter there.
Agent: But what I like to educate people on when we are talking on [ORG-8] is really about the other collaboration that you can really do with the software.
Agent: And that's, you kind of can be one place where you actually don't even need to leave the application and so it can be like an internal engagement and collaboration tool of, you know, all of your...
Agent: I guess like Productivity like tools can be like within that.
Agent: So like we use [PERSON-5] which is basically like [ORG-25] and you know that can be all within your [ORG-8] channel and then you can edit that within [ORG-8]. You can use your, it's like a sheets equivalent.
Agent: You can go to that all within [ORG-8] without even leaving the application. We're even seeing like federal adoption like with people using [ORG-8] for volunteer management and even emergency management of notifying people.
EndUser: Ah Yeah
Agent: So, I mean, everything that you're talking about, we can do and then some.
Agent: So, I think what makes sense is, I guess, first let me ask, is there a budget for this and to, what is that decision-making process?
Agent: Is it through the [ORG-5] or?
Agent: You know, are you involved in that process?
Agent: Like what does that kind of look like?
Agent: Like if everything goes, you want to buy [ORG-8], how would we execute it?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, good question. I have no idea.
EndUser: So, yeah, until [TIME-1], when I learned that, you know, I was [DATE-6] when I learned [PERSON-6] existed, you know, the plan that we had been operating under was, okay, we want to put together this, you know, remote community of practice.
EndUser: And what are some options for doing that?
EndUser: Like I said, we kind of went through that and everybody hates [ORG-8] and email isn't going to work. It's just a giant email list. That's not effective.
EndUser: And a bunch of us do [ORG-8], that hey, we could, we could just get a free version of [ORG-8].
EndUser: We would have to operate kind of outside the guise of [ORG-5], because we can't, we're not gonna be able to use this on our government computers, but we all have university computers that run all the time, so we could do it through that.
EndUser: And because we would be operating kind of outside the space of the official space of our organization, or like we're just going to have to limit ourselves to the free version because because the agency isn't going to say yeah you know what will pony up you know whatever it is uh... [MONEY-2] a person for a hundred fifty people uh... for something that's unofficial like they can't there's no way they could do that so like i was going to live within the limits of the third of the free thing we can try it for [DATE-7] a year and kind of see how it goes And then we can revisit the ID and see if there's maybe a better way to handle this.
EndUser: So that's still my kind of mind.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That's still what I'm guessing, you know, I could easily see that happening.
EndUser: Again, but now knowing that there's a gov [ORG-8] version, one thing that's okay, you know, I'll at least kind of talk to you, you guys see what it looks like in terms of pricing and then go to my leadership and say, okay, look, we've been talking about this community of practice thing.
EndUser: You know, I've been procrastinating on it for [DATE-8] now. You know, I finally, you know, decided to get off my button. Do something again.
EndUser: I discovered that there's [PERSON-7], so it could be a little bit more official. We wouldn't have to fly under the radar quite as much. This is what a cost structure might look like.
EndUser: And I would take it to them and just sort of see what they thought about it.
Agent: No, I'm not.
EndUser: So, so they have no idea this is coming. This is just going to make me blindsided them and go, I'm like, hey, here's this thing.
Agent: I've talked to you.
EndUser: Maybe we can do this.
Agent: You were so at the right place though, because honestly, like I, I know you talked to another person that's kind of in a similar role to me. He just, he only sells plaque for he's like an [ORG-21].
Agent: Like they just take in bounds and like kind of answer the phone.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: How I describe my, my role is I'm the hunter, gather of information to like steer you in the right direction. I can't actually tell you anything if I wanted to.
Agent: We have like a [ORG-8] design team to like, you know, manage the contract and like deal, close the deal.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: So you're in the [GPE-4] place, you know, talking to the right person. Don't worry about any of that.
EndUser: Yeah, and I'm not worried about getting, you know, sold hard because honestly my answer is gonna be I don't have any authority to make a decision You know like I said I got to take this to somebody else and if I feel like I'm getting you know pressure I'm just gonna go like forget it We're just gonna go back to the free concept and live with that and see how that works for a while So I'm gonna yeah, so I'm not worried about any of that other stuff
Agent: Yeah, I know [ORG-5] is like used as for other, you know, needs like, you know, or [GPE-5] or [ORG-30] tool and some others.
Agent: But just question like if, like say you go to leadership like in, is you think that there's a bigger need at [ORG-5]?
Agent: Like would there be any opportunity for you to collaborate with, you know, more internal people like the, not regular scientists, but people that aren't affiliated with the universities?
Agent: Like is there any need for that or like do you think that this is really good?
Agent: I was just thinking like if it was a bigger like let's say [ORG-5] bought [ORG-8] for everyone then they could have a portion of like this is again like above my period but then it goes into like bigger version of free licenses for you know analysts or something and that Right.
EndUser: Yeah, I don't, yeah, and that's, that's way above my pay grade. I mean, that's, you know, there's the, so there's the agency, which is [ORG-5].
Agent: Yep.
EndUser: There's actually, there's a level under that, which I forget what it's called. But for us, it's like environmental management or something. I can't remember what we're called. And then under that, there's [ORG-6].
EndUser: So we're like multiple tiers down from [ORG-5].
EndUser: And the other part to that is that, so within the federal side of things, which is really what we're talking about, is sort of a way to link up all these federal scientists across the country, our organization, which is [ORG-6], already has some tools that use to do certain things.
EndUser: So for example, They use, it used to be called digital measures, I think it's called something else now.
EndUser: So they use that sort of portal tool for all this reporting that we have to do and record keeping it and a bunch of things like that.
EndUser: I mean, you name it and they've got something that they're doing for it. And for the most part, all the scientists that I sort of mentioned, we all operate very independently.
EndUser: So just as an example, our research is indicated by anybody at the, you know, at the national level.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: My research is driven by money that I can find, you know, through grants and opportunities to go and do things.
EndUser: And so, how is it so decentralized?
EndUser: There's not this big desire to kind of triangitalize it and try and do all these other things.
EndUser: And the idea for the community of practice is simply that there's so much bureaucracy that goes on our jobs and so many challenges that we all kind of face with whatever the case might be with new procedures for buying a vehicle or what's this rule about publication copyright forms.
EndUser: And we're just like, we just need a forum where we can talk about that more easily and get a better handle on it.
EndUser: Amongst ourselves, that always having to go back to, for example, headquarters in the admin people who rely very heavily on [ORG-22] as a way to sort of distribute information and do those kinds of things.
EndUser: And so I think from that perspective, you know what, again, I think within [ORG-7], which is the extent to which this would ever go, I really think it's a tool really just to help facilitate communication across folks.
EndUser: Without them having to go to [ORG-8], which everybody's reluctant to do, and to be quite honest, there's a level of, there's also a level of concern about monitoring the traffic and the language, not the language, but monitoring the traffic and the conversations through [ORG-8] that we all felt a little bit safer with [ORG-8].
Agent: You don't want you to.
Agent: Yeah, I know and I'm very happy to hear that and, you know, I we had another customer kind of within you. I kind of joking. They felt that.
Agent: Teams was the poor man version of [ORG-8], which is kind of funny because everyone uses Teams. You know, we have stuff for tellers all the time that they need to use Teams link instead of [ORG-30] or WebEx.
Agent: So it does have a good foothold, but I think when people can see the scope and ability and how easy it is to use [ORG-8], it really does resonate.
EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: So.
Agent: What I would like to do is to set up a call with you and anyone else that you think on your side should be involved and our [ORG-8] representatives, just to kind of share what we can help you do, go into that pricing breakdown and kind of see if there's something that we can help you with more than just the free version.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm happy to do that again as long as you realize that you know, again, you know, nobody's given me permission to do this at this point.
EndUser: And, you know, and I'm reluctant to reach out to headquarters yet just because.
Agent: No, I knew that ammo so you can go to headquarters. Like trust me, this is just a friendly conversation, not trying to convince you one way or the other.
Agent: Like oftentimes we do free trials in the first place anyway. So yeah, like I totally appreciate that and I'll make sure I relate that as well. But don't feel any pressure on that side.
Agent: We have many conversations that do not turn into anything at all. So even a free trial is better than nothing.
Agent: So I... looking to share this with my team and introduce you and see if this is the next direction you want to go in.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, no, I'd be happy to do that. And I think, you know, what I'm trying to get a sense of is, again, you know, is, you know, okay, I know I can always go to a free version.
EndUser: I know what that limit, I know what those limits are. It's understandable. You know, yeah, it's unfortunate, but we could make that work.
EndUser: And then, you know, am I looking at [MONEY-3] a year?
EndUser: You know, we're looking at [MONEY-4] a year.
EndUser: How would, you know, what are those price points look like?
EndUser: And then I can go, I think, to headquarters and go, hey, look, you know, we talked about this in our meeting [DATE-9]. Here, you know, here's one option to sort of make it a little bit more official.
EndUser: And I can even have that conversation a little bit under the radar with a couple of folks before it goes all the way up to the top to sort of see if they think, like, yeah, you know, we're better off just sort of keeping this on the down low for now and not, you know, not shelling out money on it or no.
EndUser: You know, this sounds like a good way to sort of formalize it and let's go ahead and think this through.
EndUser: Because honestly, one of the challenges we know we're going to have if we do this, so again, as I mentioned, right, you've got all these people at universities around the country function on und.edu addresses.
EndUser: So if we go with a free version of [ORG-8], we can all participate. But our admin staff.
EndUser: Who all function off of <inaudible> gov addresses and are on government machines and government buildings [DATE-5] long they can't participate so we have a conversation and we want to real and we want to kind of bring them into that now we gotta go back over [ORG-8] to do that break it because they can't because they can't put [ORG-8] on their government machine Yeah.
Agent: And yeah,
Agent: That's definitely not what we want.
Agent: We do want it to be like our whole mission and what we help the federal government do is really create like a single streamline source of truth and one centralized place where all of your data, all of your applications, everything can be integrated into one and like that's kind of what core does like create the dashboard or... you know, record system for you to like, you know, manage, like, case tracking or, you know, whatever, whatever we've even done like plant and animal tracking, you know, if you're familiar with [ORG-25], [ORG-30], mineral, yeah, so that's all sales force and essential.
EndUser: Thanks for watching!
Agent: So they use essential to install our mule sauce, our Integration platform, but I think just, even the work that we've done across the federal government and just getting people familiar with that, what would probably happen is after a conversation with the [ORG-8] team, we would probably show you a demo-ish and you could loop in maybe some of those more senior people, but that would be the second or third or even later calls.
Agent: It's kind of all on your timeline. It's not like we're going to try to come and ram Slack down your throat or anything like that.
Agent: It's just more... You know, the first calls typically like what we just basically had going through, you know, qualifying questions what you really are looking for and then just showing you what we can do.
Agent: And then you'll have more information to go back to those decision makers and, you know, then you can come back to us and let us know if that's what you're looking for.
Agent: And even if you do decide to go the free version, like there's, you know, there's different, There's different like, you know, different program, not programs, but like types of licenses that my stock representative can like kind of break out to you.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, I think that would be helpful because, and so just as an example, if you look at that front page of that web page again, so to the left of the map, there's sort of four other icons, right?
EndUser: Publications, projects, species, dissertations, and presentations.
EndUser: Yeah, so if you click on the projects button or projects icon, you see all these projects kind of pop up, right?
EndUser: So you can just go ahead and click on the first one, working to conserve [GPE-6]'s ESAs species.
Agent: Okay. Yeah.
EndUser: And it takes forever to load because it's slow.
EndUser: So when I look at that, right, so I can look at the bar across the top and I can actually see my colleague's name at the end, [ORG-30], too, so I know whose record this is.
EndUser: And this is incredibly slow. This page is always slow. But anyway, when it does eventually open, What you'll see is some sort of a project description for what these folks or what this particular project is working on.
EndUser: And that's being pulled, so you know again, because you were talking about, you know we can integrate with these other databases, they've already got a bunch of things like that already set up.
EndUser: So this is pulling from this digital measures database that we all used and all of our projects and everything else, which we've been relying on for [DATE-10]. So there's some pretty heavy infrastructure already in place.
EndUser: That they're pulling from to sort of build this web page.
EndUser: And so I think, I just want to make it clear, I think the opportunity to sort of look for other ways to sort of bring in other databases and those kinds of things, that's going to be kind of a tough sell because I think they're going to be reluctant.
Agent: Oh yeah.
EndUser: They're like, no, we got digital measures, we've invested a lot in it. And I think they're going to be reluctant to move away from that right up the path.
EndUser: But I think, you know, but I get that that's, you know, they also may not know what's available and so having those conversations is understandable.
EndUser: But I just wanted you to be aware like they're already doing a lot of things like that. And so, you know, there may be some reluctance to go beyond a basic platform basically.
Agent: Yeah, and we trust me we are talking at the you know at the [PERSON-8] level with the guy Oh's office and whatnot like that's usually and even like even at [ORG-30] headquarters as well So we are talking to you know everyone like you you would probably think of but and that's right It's an uphill battle like I hear all day every day.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: We're using [ORG-33]. We're using [ORG-22].
EndUser: Right.
Agent: Yeah, I
EndUser: Yeah, and share point is the big one, right?
EndUser: They're like, oh, that's in [ORG-22]. You're like, oh, [ORG-22] is just so.
Agent: I'm in a big investment service now. We hear all of it, so I totally appreciate that and I know that. And I guess my point is,
Agent: So our software, we like to be, is like a, even like with Slack kind of, for example, like how you can talk to like external people even, like not just within your organization.
Agent: And it's, you know, seems to be bad too, but it does like try to create like just in how you can like tie in all your applications in this [ORG-8].
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Like we do try to be agnostic of the partners and the data sets that we can connect to. And so that's kind of like the big benefit once you're using the full platform of [ORG-12].
Agent: But I completely understand that this conversation is only around [ORG-8].
Agent: I just more so like, I guess like even for my knowledge as I am like in like ground 12 kind of purposes, like as we do start to talk to those more so decision makers, like are you happy with that digital measures database?
Agent: Like is it?
EndUser: Yeah, I guess.
Agent: Like you have any information on that?
EndUser: Uh... i'd kind of don't uh... i mean i know it's so far i was the acting deputy chief of the program for a while while they were first at the time i know a little bit about that kind of stuff but we've got you know a few people who uh... who works specifically kind of with those things uh... you know they may or may not be interested in talking to folks in a lot of them to be honest that haven't because they've been in the government for a while they have you know all they know is what they know, right, which is [ORG-8] and [ORG-22] and those other kinds of things.
EndUser: And I would, you know, they may or may not be interested in having that conversation. It's hard for me to know that.
Agent: No, I was just curious as you mentioned it, but no, I think for the purposes of our conversation, you know, moving forward with luck and setting up like a quick [TIME-2] call with the team is probably makes sense if you're open to it.
EndUser: Yes. Yeah. No, I would like to chat with them a little bit and see what some of the other options are. I think that would be helpful.
EndUser: And again, then if at some point it seems like, yeah, you know, bringing in the higher ups makes sense. I would do that.
EndUser: Or I would just say, okay, let me put together, you know, based on what you told me, you know, let me go ahead and put together, you know, a request to them and say, hey, look, here's something that we could do, you know, and not bring them in.
EndUser: So, yeah, I can see, I definitely think it's worth talking to your team a little bit more, at least for me, so that I can... then go up the chain a little bit and figure out how to move forward with it potentially.
Agent: We're not zero.
EndUser: So, yes, that would be great.
Agent: You have your calendar up?
Agent: Like is there any time like, I mean, I know it's a little tight [DATE-8], but we could maybe fit something in [DATE-12] or [DATE-8] where we're relatively open.
Agent: If you don't know what your schedule is like, or later.
EndUser: Yeah, so I'm relatively open [DATE-12], I would say, between, I'm on [LOC-1], so all times [LOC-2].
EndUser: I'd say between 10 and 2 tomorrow would be pretty easy for me if you guys have time then or we can look at time [DATE-8].
Agent: Okay, so, um,
EndUser: I could say I'm looking at a calendar on [ORG-8] but I haven't figured out how to use that
Agent: No, don't worry about that. Um, I will, I missed, I needed to talk, it's not me, I'm free and I see you are the person's free [DATE-12].
Agent: It's just, there's one individual I just need to check with.
Agent: But I do see, are you free at all between like at 10 on [DATE-15] or now?
EndUser: Uh... [TIME-3] i'm unfortunately now [DATE-14] all day i monday's gonna suck actually Now they look like calendar [DATE-15].
Agent: Yeah, no, sorry.
EndUser: [DATE-15]'s gonna suck. And [DATE-18] I gotta go to the dentist. It looks like. And then I've got another, [DATE-18] doesn't look great either. Wow. My [DATE-8] is not looking very good.
EndUser: Honestly, if it's [DATE-8], it's gonna be [DATE-22] [TIME-4].
Agent: Okay, so I'm let's try to make what try to make
EndUser: You can get back to me about [DATE-12]. I've got nothing on my calendar right now. It's not that I don't have anything to do, but I'm unscheduled.
EndUser: So you can get back to me later and be like, hey, you know, [TIME-5] would be great. You can check with your friend and just get back to me.
Agent: Can you do [TIME-6] [DATE-12]?
EndUser: Let me look at something real quick.
Agent: I know an afternoon on a [DATE-14] is not always the best either.
EndUser: No, it's fine. And honestly, it's not as much of a work thing. It's... I do a fair amount of that. But I'm mountain bike, I race mountain bikes in my spare time. And so I've got a pretty...
EndUser: I have a pretty laid out training schedule. So I just have to look at kind of what that looks like for [DATE-12] to see if I can move things around.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So yeah, I could do [TIME-7].
Agent: Okay, let's do it. I'll put that on. I'll send it right now. So, and
Agent: [TIME-8].
EndUser: And if you would rather do it through a Slack thing, if you would prefer to do it with video as well, or we can do a phone call or whatever other platform you got to use.
Agent: Does [ORG-36] meet work for you?
EndUser: Yeah, I can do [ORG-30].
Agent: Okay, okay, I'll send [ORG-36] me right now. Here, let me just send that over.
Agent: Do you should see that on your calendar?
Agent: I'll add a little bit of it. I'll send an email too once we hang up and I chat with the team, just like with a tentative agenda. But if I leave anything out, just let me know.
Agent: And we will will amend it accordingly.
EndUser: Okay, that sounds great and it's wily, is that right?
Agent: Yep, [PERSON-9].
EndUser: Okay, and are you also, were you located rightly?
Agent: I'm right outside of [GPE-2] in [GPE-7]. So, our, yeah.
EndUser: Oh, okay, so yeah, so our headquarters, the headquarters for us is over in [GPE-8].
Agent: Yeah, so we've definitely talked to people there and, you know, it's definitely, we have a few relationships, you know, going on, but given that your guys is a cloud contract is a protest, I've been told that, you know, talking to vendors for the actual like core initiatives, like some of the stuff I mentioned, it's kind of on pause right now.
EndUser: Interesting.
Agent: But other than that, like [ORG-8] and the co-prime stuff, I think is free range, and especially if it's not a corporate buy. It wasn't us that did your homework in the past.
Agent: The contract was granted to someone else and apparently did not go well. So I heard that it's up for protests at the moment. So we were having really good conversations and I was so excited.
Agent: I was like, oh, we're going to have all these wins at [ORG-5]. So, you know. We've had a lot of success other places and then like this happened.
Agent: So hopefully, you know, I'm excited to chat [DATE-12] and see what we can do with the, you know, the cooperative unit and hopefully, you know, It can help you make your life a little easier too.
EndUser: Oh, Okay, well that sounds great [PERSON-10], I appreciate it and I appreciate you guys being understanding too about you know that this might just lead to me just getting another free version of [ORG-8] for our team and it may not go anywhere so I appreciate you taking time to spite that as a potential outcome.
Agent: Yes, of course. Yeah, no worries at all. That's what we're here for. That's one of the resource to you and continue to build upon the relationship.
EndUser: All right, well that sounds great [PERSON-10], I'll talk to you all tomorrow.
Agent: Yeah, have [DATE-22] and good luck with training. Be safe out there. Bye bye.

The customer has used the product before and is familiar with its features, and they express interest in potentially upgrading from the free version to a paid version that would better suit their needs. However, the customer also mentions that they need to discuss the potential purchase with their leadership and higher-ups, so a final decision has not been made. Overall, the customer seems to have a positive view of the seller's product and its potential to meet their needs.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer:

1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's unique organizational structure and how it impacts their use of technology. The customer's organization is decentralized and operates on university campuses, which presents unique challenges in terms of communication and collaboration tools. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand these challenges and how the seller's product could address them.

2. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current use of the seller's product. The customer mentioned that they are currently using the seller's product on a pro plan and are familiar with it. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand how the customer is using the product, what features they find most useful, and where they see room for improvement.

3. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's budget and decision-making process. The customer mentioned that they have no idea what the budget or decision-making process is for purchasing the seller's product. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's budget constraints and who else needs to be involved in the decision-making process.

4. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's concerns about security and monitoring. The customer mentioned that they are reluctant to bring in certain databases and applications because of concerns about security and monitoring. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand these concerns and how the seller's product could address them.

5. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's training schedule and availability. The customer mentioned that they have a laid out training schedule for mountain biking and that certain days are not ideal for meetings. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's availability and schedule the meeting accordingly.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the collaboration capabilities of the seller's product, specifically the ability to use it as an ""internal engagement and collaboration tool"" with various productivity features like editing documents and managing volunteers without leaving the application. They also mentioned the potential for using the product to create a community of practice for their decentralized group, which faces challenges with communication and staying updated on policies and procedures. The customer was also interested in the product's security features, particularly the government-specific version, as they were under the impression that they couldn't use the product on their government computers for their unofficial community of practice.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: The customer, who is a faculty member at a university and part of a federal program, mentioned that they would need to involve their leadership and potentially other individuals in the decision-making process. The agreed-upon next step is a call between the customer, the sales representative, and the sales representative's team to discuss options and pricing. The customer is open to exploring possibilities but emphasized that they may only be able to move forward with a free version of the product. The correct decision-maker would likely be someone with the authority to approve the budget and implementation of the product, but their identity was not explicitly mentioned during the call.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was open to further discussion and exploration of the seller's product. They were interested in learning more about the pricing and features of the product, and were willing to involve their leadership and other team members in future discussions. However, they were also clear that they may only be able to use the free version of the product, and the seller should be understanding of this potential outcome. Overall, the customer seemed to have a positive attitude towards the seller and was appreciative of their time and willingness to help.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""What makes this group fall into the school?"" The customer provided a detailed explanation of their role as faculty members at a university, but paid by the federal government, and how they function as part of the university system. The customer seemed engaged as they provided a clear and detailed response.
2. ""Is there a budget for this and to, what is that decision-making process? Is it through the [ORG-5] or? You know, are you involved in that process? Like what does that kind of look like?"" These questions allowed the customer to explain the current decision-making process and their role in it. The customer seemed engaged as they provided an honest answer about not knowing the budget or decision-making process.
3. ""What I would like to do is to set up a call with you and anyone else that you think on your side should be involved and our [ORG-8] representatives, just to kind of share what we can help you do, go into that pricing breakdown and kind of see if there's something that we can help you with more than just the free version."" This question showed the customer that the sales rep was interested in providing a solution that fit their needs and budget, and the customer seemed engaged as they agreed to set up a call with the sales rep and their team.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"Answer: The sales representative did a good job of articulating the value proposition of their company's product, the seller's product, by highlighting its features such as the ability to integrate with other databases, its use as a single streamlined source of truth, and its potential to create a dashboard or record system for case tracking or plant and animal tracking. However, there were a few missed opportunities where the sales representative could have further emphasized the value proposition.

Firstly, when the customer mentioned their current use of digital measures, the sales representative could have asked more questions to understand the customer's pain points with the current system and then explained how the seller's product could address those specific issues. For example, they could have asked about the limitations of digital measures, the difficulties the customer faces while using it, and how the seller's product could provide a better solution.

Secondly, when the customer mentioned their reluctance to bring in admin staff who function off of .gov addresses and are on government machines and buildings, the sales representative could have emphasized how the seller's product can cater to the needs of different user groups, including those with government-issued devices. They could have provided examples of other government organizations that have successfully implemented the seller's product for their admin staff, thus addressing the customer's concerns.

Lastly, the sales representative could have done a better job of tying the features of the seller's product to the customer's specific needs and goals. While they did mention how the product could help with communication and data integration, they could have further explained how these features would translate into tangible benefits for the customer, such as increased efficiency, better decision-making, or cost savings. By doing so, the sales representative would have made a more compelling case for the value of the seller's product.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The customer's top concerns about the seller's product were related to security, pricing, and integration with existing systems. They mentioned that they were initially under the impression that they couldn't use the product on government computers and were considering using a free version of a different product instead. They also expressed concern about the cost for a large number of users and the potential limitations of the platform. Additionally, they mentioned that their organization has already invested heavily in digital measures and may be reluctant to move away from it.

Answer to this question is clear."
voice_14363_167_0LQ3y00000AE68nGAD,"Agent: If you're here at [ORG-1], I'll be going.
EndUser: Oh, you finally call me done work hours.
Agent: I got Yeah, I got you during [EVENT-1], man. I just wanted to give you a call and express my gratitude for everything that happened [DATE-1]. We're feeling pretty good about it.
Agent: I hope you guys are as well.
EndUser: You. You know, it's definitely something I think that probably just needs to happen in general. But it was interesting. My guys were talking to each other and going through it.
Agent: .
EndUser: One of our, you know, the way we do stuff right now. And one of them is brand new.
EndUser: And so we got with my other rep and it was like, you know, show me how I'm finding things and do all this.
EndUser: And they came back and they were like, I think we have way more questions than we have answers after after looking at the way we do things and maybe suggestions.
EndUser: And I'm like, well, I'm looking into myself because I'm and so.
EndUser: And that said, but we can have a meeting and see what you guys are, you know, looking into and stuff so I can make sure that whatever solution and of course that we're looking at is going to meet them which I'll guarantee, you know, I feel pretty confident it will.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: It's just a matter of Implementation and understanding.
Agent: And I think that's, you know, that's where [PERSON-1] comes in and hopefully you got a chance to see the email I sent [TIME-1], but he mentioned that there's a lot of integrations that we can achieve.
Agent: Did you guys decide to go with us?
Agent: And I think that will. really help with the workflows that you guys have in place. So hopefully that's...
EndUser: Now Lloyd, how does that work?
EndUser: You know, so was [PERSON-2] with you guys?
EndUser: Is he not with you guys?
EndUser: Like, how does that work?
Agent: So he's not. So he's suggested Implementation specialist. So we've got [PRODUCT-1], like a roledex of companies that achieve that part of it because we just provide the actual software. [PERSON-2]'s team would actually be the ones that implement.
Agent: You know, they might even come on site and just make sure that in terms of how you guys are using it out in the field on your cells, everything like that, how it's.
Agent: You know, linked up to your financial systems, all those things are the way that they'll consult with you guys and make sure that it's implemented correctly.
EndUser: Ah, well that sounds... That sounds pretty cool.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: All right.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I'm just trying to. I'm starting the ballpark. My, you know, figures in my head. I mean, don't get me wrong. I understand it costs money, Lord, but I just, I'm just trying to start ball parking.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Some budgetary numbers in my head. That was kind of thing. So.
Agent: Yeah, and that's what we'll talk a little bit more about on [DATE-2] as well.
Agent: Um, depending on if you guys think this is the right solution, we'll make sure that we figure it out, right?
Agent: Like the last thing we do is make sure that, you know, pricing is the thing that holds us back.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: But what I was going to mention, I think [PERSON-3] kind of alluded to it before is like, we just want to get your foot in the door and then once you get there, then that's when we can start figuring out best ways to save money or save, save dollars on your end.
Agent: I guess when my questions was because I didn't want to make sure I didn't want to ask this in front of everyone I didn't think it was kind of it was kosher for the actual conversation going on But let's just say that in the best in the perfect world.
Agent: We are gonna work together Who's the one that actually you know signs the check or the last the last I guess
EndUser: So, [PERSON-4], I am pretty high. I just can't sign. I can't, let's just say this.
EndUser: Once I get to say yes, we can go, but the officers, they technically, and that's why I said I have my [DATE-3] meeting, I'm on the [ORG-2] team, but I'm just a, I'm a non-officer member of that [ORG-2].
Agent: [PERSON-5].
EndUser: So, of course, I'm just giving them updates for sales and marketing, and I get pervy to... all that information, but my CEO, my CFO, and my CEO are technically the top officers.
EndUser: So without their approval, which is why I would bring it up to them, or blessing, then everything goes from there. But if I say yes, that means you have their approval.
Agent: Yeah. Okay, so you're the guy that we've got to make sure is completely convinced.
Agent: Do you think that you need anything else from me besides what we've shown you so far that would help?
EndUser: So, let's see, so it made a couple of things that have been rattling in my head is, but of course all this is definitely Implementation stuff and maybe stuff I can [ORG-3].
EndUser: When it comes to the cell phones and people out on out on about somebody doing me a call directly, you know, I don't how do I law, you know, I guess I need to go through the process of seeing this because I never used it, but I know every company that's bigger than me is using [ORG-1].
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: So it's like what I'm trying to I'm just trying to go through my head because But we just don't have a process. This is the best way to say it. I mean, it's just been done for however long.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And honestly, good thing we're good at what we do because it's been okay. But at the same time, it's a hindrance at this point. When we're trying to beat up against the [MONEY-1] Revenue line, so.
Agent: Right. Yeah, and I would say, you know, even myself, like I experienced the same thing here at [ORG-1] as we sell. You know, everything is. accessible through our cell just like it would be on the laptop.
Agent: So I know you expressed like the, I guess, how daunting it is having to, you know, log those types of things.
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Well, that's other through Implementation we can have an automatic process for. Yeah.
EndUser: That sounds pretty, pretty hot there, Lord. So. Um, but yeah, because that's, I mean, again, those are all these things that are just, um, those things are, those things are passing through. Uh, those, and, um.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: In the follow-up. I mean, like the pipe drive, it does have the thing, but I have to go to the app to go do everything.
EndUser: And I'm like, well, this is, I don't know, it just seems, wait, this thing, I just don't like, I just don't like pipe drive, how about that?
Agent: Yeah, not get it. Yeah, you know, we did.
Agent: And so that's the thing, right?
Agent: Like I just called you through my [ORG-1] app. So.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Through that [ORG-1] app without me having to do anything, it already logs everything for me.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So, yeah.
EndUser: So it is similar in that case. And then once you hang up, it asks you, hey, let's do the follow up with him.
EndUser: And what's the next step and all that jazz?
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: That is that.
Agent: Exactly, exactly.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Yeah, and then, you know, we've got obviously, I've got access to everything.
Agent: We wouldn't start you off with like... the the rules were always so sales force instance but you know in my instance it'll say did you talk about this you talk about that do you understand who's going to be the economic fire and then you know update your closed date type thing yeah so lo and behold what i'm trying to make sure that you feel comfortable with is like the functionality is there it's just where do we start but Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yes, yes, no, absolutely. So you had sent me the screenshots. And kind of a quick synopsis of this product demo.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: Okay. Do do do.
EndUser: And which one, if I was going to the website right now, [PERSON-4], which products are you suggesting right now just to make sure that I'm aware?
EndUser: I mean, I'm sure.
Agent: Yeah, it'll be Sales Cloud and Marketing cloud.
EndUser: Ok.
Agent: So Sales Cloud will fall into like the core product. And then the Marketing Cloud is for, you know, [PERSON-6]. And then what [FAC-1] would represent. Yeah.
EndUser: Ok. All right.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Sales cloud and Marketing cloud. OK.
Agent: And then those if through the Implementation would be connected. So like everything that obviously Marketing seeing they would have a single point of record for anything that the sales team's doing and adversely as well.
EndUser: Gotcha. Gotcha. OK. Well, and then of course, everything would just line into straight into advantage and stuff from there. Then it's.
Agent: Exactly. And that's where that's where [PERSON-7] would come in and to make sure that. Not only sales cloud, [PRODUCT-2] are connected, but [ORG-4] is also connected.
Agent: So then there's a lot less redundancy and you guys can start to really focus in on the workflows that you're looking for. And then part of the consulting that they'll provide is what's best practice in that regard to.
EndUser: Okay, well that's interesting. Probably would just need that training in general anyway, because all I got, I got the [ORG-5] practice right now.
Agent: Right. Wev roadside.
EndUser: It could, it might as well, it might be best in some occasions, but it might, definitely not be another so for sure.
Agent: Well, that [DATE-4], they'll take that feedback about what you're doing and then try to implement that into a formal process throughout the actual systems as well.
EndUser: That'd be cool. All right, so it would be the Sales Cloud edition.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Okay, I just pull and everything up right here so I can get it and it would be, okay, and it's a Price per user per month, but it has a different one.
EndUser: So you said, did you say Enterprise when we were talking about it?
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: That's correct. Yeah, because Enterprise can give you guys the ability to connect some APIs that you would need.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: As you grow, there might be some other systems that, you know, on top of mind, and then like zoom that you guys have mentioned with webinars and those types of things we want to be integrated with your system as well.
EndUser: Now let me ask you this while I get you on the phone and I'm looking at it.
EndUser: Is there a, you know, a way that you, you know, you get certain people, you know, at least, you know, once I get the enterprise, I get everything involved with the enterprise.
EndUser: But there's no way to like just have one person with like the Einstein one. Right, there's no way to do that. Right, that's just a different complete package for the total for the total company type of thing.
Agent: No, we could actually, we could provision licenses where one person gets there and send one and then the rest are looking at it in a more a watered down version.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Absolutely. Um, that's, that's kind of why we always want to do the consultative approach is like, what do, what does each and everyone of y'all need versus, you know, buying a bunch of stuff that you don't need.
EndUser: Yeah, no, for sure. And I'm just, yeah, because I mean, this is all, you know, the collaboration. Okay, Lord, let me ask you this. I keep on seeing this everywhere.
EndUser: What's the difference between the teams and the [ORG-6]?
EndUser: I mean, there's so many, I looked at one of my friends' computers and they literally had five different types of chat stuff on their computer.
EndUser: And I'm like, why do you need five different types of chats?
Agent: Man, [ORG-6] is awesome.
EndUser: Mintylot
Agent: So we are just learning how, because [ORG-1] Acquired Slack [DATE-5].
Agent: And so I've used [ORG-6] in every single company that I've worked at all the way dating back to [ORG-7], which I worked at [ORG-7] in [DATE-6] and I wanna say [DATE-7].
Agent: And so [ORG-6] integrates, it will integrate with all your [ORG-1] and Marketing instances.
EndUser: Interrupts. mmm
Agent: So instead of like, you know, uh, sending someone something is like, Hey, this person just gave us a call. This is what they're looking at. This is the project they're looking at.
Agent: Um, I send you maybe a link and then it just kind of pops up. That person clicks on a link and opens up like a, um, different web, like a different like web tab or whatever.
Agent: And now you're driving through a different type of system. Slack, you, you could literally put in, okay, um, [ORG-5] just gave me a call and it would in [ORG-6].
Agent: And just like you might be familiar with teams in [ORG-6]. It'll pull up all the top fields that I think as an administrator are going to be important.
Agent: So last activity, what was said, all those different things, but [ORG-6] is a pure [ORG-8].
Agent: So we use [ORG-6] and it obviously just is intuitive on your phone as it is on your laptop, but it gives you accounts, objects, events that are coming up.
Agent: You can share reports, all that good stuff with all the visualizations without having to like be without any code, if you will.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: And it's very, very cool system. I'm absolutely happy to give even our [PRODUCT-3] on a call just to show you what that looks like because that's how we communicate.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: So we don't communicate through text or anything like that directly. All my co workers, even [PERSON-8], who's not part of our organization. Formally, I can I can I communicate with him through [ORG-6].
Agent: So you can do you can do external and internal communication.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Okay, yeah, and I guess that's where I guess it kind of lost me is because we've had such a, you know, I guess, I mean, we're not a huge company, right?
EndUser: We're about, you know, 155 people, right?
Agent: Sorry.
EndUser: So and maybe, you know, [DATE-8], you know, [PERCENT-1] of those are, you know, actual, you know, field personnel, people that are actually doing the work, you know, doing the work, the other stuff, the other half of the overhead.
EndUser: But most of the time, I mean, I'm always on my cell phone, but, you know, Everybody has my cell phone number. So it is. You're right. It's all text messages.
EndUser: It's all this, that, and the other, or the teams coming up in the Teams app. And I don't know. I guess that's why I was asking about the [ORG-6], about how that was integrated.
EndUser: But it would be nice to, you're saying it brings up what y'all talked about last and all that. And I had it right in front of me. And I'm like, yeah, I remember talking with [PERSON-9].
EndUser: This is what I needed to discuss with him.
Agent: Exactly, and you can see that all on your phone too.
Agent: So like instead of having to worry about you know someone texting you something that's you know maybe time sensitive or Requires you to look at the record You need to be able to see all that in your phone Yeah And i'll actually send you Adjust a nice little like video from [ORG-9] that shows you so like i go over you and how it integrates with sales force.
EndUser: Uh huh.
EndUser: Gotcha.
Agent: And some people have it stand alone to be frank with you. And I worked at a company before sales force where we were about 210 people. We used [ORG-6] religiously.
EndUser: Hmm. Okay. Yeah.
EndUser: Again, I mean, I know we're not the most up and coming on technology clearly, right?
EndUser: But at the same time, you know, just as it's not our focus, our focus is more on the environmental stuff, but be nice to figure out, you know, if there's any other smoother ways to communicate or even to turn your brain on and off to know when I opened up [ORG-6] it's going to be about this.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: So.
Agent: And you can, you know, group chats and everything like that are extremely easy.
Agent: You know, I've got a group chat where, you know, because [FAC-1] sits on the Marketing team and the SE Aaron that walked you through the Marketing side, we don't sit on the same teams, right?
EndUser: Mm hmm.
Agent: So like we have a group chat that is titled [GPE-1]. And so that's all in that group chat we talk about is the conversation that we have going on with you.
EndUser: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Okay. Um. Interesting. Very, very interesting.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Very, very cool. Again, like it was funny because I was interviewing with sales force a while back. Slack was what I was going to look at as well. And then sales were spot slack.
EndUser: Yeah. It would have got there anywhere.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But would you have gotten an extra check if you were at [ORG-6] and then they bought it?
EndUser: Oh, no, maybe not.
Agent: Yeah, I think so.
EndUser: Okay, good deal. So, cool, man. That's awesome. That's really cool stuff here.
EndUser: And so I would have to definitely, I'm definitely will look into if, you know, I think at a minimum, I mean, the whole, the full sandbox situation.
EndUser: I mean, I would have to talk to [PERSON-10] about something like that because that's what he does with vantage point right now just to make sure everything is, you know, would be good.
EndUser: It does sound like sometimes it is good to have at least one person to have a sandbox. I don't know if you have any sandbox capabilities in the [ORG-10] or it's just, okay, all right.
Agent: We do.
EndUser: So, or what the difference, because it says full sandbox and it doesn't say that on the enterprise.
Agent: Yeah, we could absolutely. That's could be something that we could build into the agreement as well so that you guys are being able to see the things that are coming up.
Agent: And I'll also send you kind of like what I said, that is like a newsletter of the upcoming things that we're talking about.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Ai is one of the big things that we're talking about as well. So I'll make sure that you're aware of that. So I'll stand over.
Agent: A copy of my [DATE-9] newsletter and then I'll also send over a quick overview of what [ORG-6] looks like and it'll just be a nice [PRODUCT-4] video that you can...
EndUser: Yeah, no, I would definitely be interested in, you know, the see how, you know, AI could be, you know, more helpful.
EndUser: I mean, AI can just do whatever you want it to do, honestly, just depending on what the, you know, the back house data is that it's pulling from.
Agent: Right.
Agent: Right. Mm-hmm.
EndUser: So I'm trying to understand that one a little bit more for sure in general.
Agent: Yeah, I can really understand that.
Agent: I think, you know, for the, I would say for the most part, or [PERCENT-2] of our clients are looking at AI as either an upgrade to what they've currently got or starting to get into the game.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Agent: Yeah. .
EndUser: Because at this point, it's kind of, Do I need to hire somebody to do this or can I just create a set of prompts and it just pops up, throws up a report when I hit enter type of thing.
EndUser: And I'm guessing that's kind of where we're going to on certain things, but. And then of course, I'm sure the cost of that is. Relative for that. And then this is okay. So it even has.
EndUser: So the [PERSON-9] co-pilot, that's completely separate from the co-pilot that we have like on the computers and stuff [DATE-10], right, on the hedge and all that kind of stuff.
Agent: That's correct.
EndUser: Okay. And by using the same terminology sometimes, I just want to make sure.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, I get that. Yeah, it's definitely a little confusing, but yeah, I mean, I would say in that regard, we would even, I would love to get [PERSON-10] back on a call.
Agent: And even if that's something that you guys are truly interested in, let him walk you through it because you're right. It is your own information activated through [FAC-2].
Agent: And we've got tons of [ORG-9] stories about how co-pilot's helping out a lot of our clients.
EndUser: Interesting. That seems like a pretty deep conversation. And that's kind of cool.
Agent: It is.
EndUser: Okay. All right. Well, man, hey, look, if you're going to change something, just go [PERCENT-3]. I mean, it is, you know, just kind of where I'm at right now. But [PERSON-15] was telling me, I'll be on the shoot.
EndUser: And she was just like, DJ, it would be nice to do something because right now we've made this makeshift and it's like, we have to fix it if we break it and it's just a headache sometimes.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, I felt like this was a great situation for [PERSON-15].
EndUser: I mean.
Agent: I'm sorry, forgive me.
Agent: What was your Marketing rep's name again?
EndUser: Yeah, that was [PERSON-9]. Yeah, that's [PERSON-9].
Agent: Yeah, I felt like it was a great situation for her and [PERSON-16]. I just want to make sure that you and I are the same page.
Agent: Send out, there's a lot of questions that go into the sales aspect of it all.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: But without even trying to sell you, I've used [ORG-1] at almost every single one of the companies I've been at.
Agent: I've used some of the competitors, and I've always felt way more empowered with [ORG-1], especially because of the mobile aspect of it all.
Agent: And I've been in the field kind of like yourself [PERCENT-3] of the time, really never even inside an office and just being able to have not only [ORG-6] integrated with it, but [ORG-1] and as a single point of truth, it was extremely helpful for me to hit my numbers wherever I was.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That is, that's going to be interesting because right now, I mean, I'll be honest with you now.
EndUser: Again, and I guess the other portion is, is I had somebody, if I'm paying y'all, I can call somebody and they say, hey, this is what we're going to do, right?
Agent: In fact.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And I'm like, oh, that sounds awesome. Let's do this.
EndUser: And I couldn't even do that when I first took over and I was like, let me place to get into this when, uh, when I had my baby and all that and I was doing new job and new baby and I was just looking at this stuff going like.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Who's in control of this?
EndUser: I mean, I know, you know, I know how to put the data inputs on it, but like for me and my team and all that kind of stuff.
EndUser: I honestly don't even have a list or an insight on here and I'm sure you can set it up, but it's just not intuitive.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: It just shows all the open deals.
EndUser: But if I just, you know, if I'm trying to see the different owners of it and kind of go from there, like, you know, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's, I didn't, that's like all I get is a screen of some red and green stuff and stuff that was from like [DATE-9] for some reason.
EndUser: And I'm like, wait, what's his activity right now?
EndUser: The most current one I have under him as an owner, and an expected close.
Agent: There.
EndUser: Ungodly is let's see he put it in that's fine is [DATE-15] of 26. Now come on.
Agent: Right, right. Yeah, you know, I just even chatted on [ORG-6] to one of my coworkers that just moved into a new role and she had one of the accounts that I'm now working with.
EndUser: How about that?
Agent: And I was able to go through our Sales Cloud instance and see some opportunities that she was working on.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: And I just messaged her and she was like, she in [ORG-6]. She just copied the URL of an opportunity that she thought would be a little bit more worth my time.
Agent: And without having to actually jump on a call with her, it just brought up all the recent history. And then because we use [PERSON-9], of course, it said this is probably the way you should reach out to them.
Agent: This is the title of your subject. And then this is what you should open up with the schedule meeting. Did that [TIME-1] and now I have a meeting with them on [DATE-9].
EndUser: Interesting.
Agent: Yeah. So it's all intuitive based on what you want it to look like.
Agent: Marketing, for instance, like [FAC-1], it would tell her a couple of different things out adversely because my title sales occurs as marketing, right?
Agent: So we're going to get different feedback from our [FAC-2], which is crazy.
EndUser: Yeah, that is interesting.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Well, um, hmm. I don't know if I'm asking the right questions or not, [PERSON-4]. I'll be honest. But, you know, I'm just kind of excited.
Agent: There's never a bad question with this, especially because we have so much to offer, right?
Agent: And that's kind of like what my job is to keep you focused on the first thing, because you guys into the actual door and then starting to build upon what you might have is going to be the best way to go about it.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Because we can say here and buy everything and I'm sure offer the value to you. But I think it's important just to start getting going, getting the team to understand what now you guys have in place.
Agent: And then once that's the case, then we're building in things like AI, we're really segmenting, we're understanding what type of data, data lakes you want to visualize in within your instance, getting rid of things that aren't going to matter because Again, you guys already did a very good job of explaining the, you're, you're selling time, which is totally different than like a software or hardware, right?
Agent: So those are going to be nuances that not only does [PERSON-2] consider, but I will consider as, you know, we work together throughout the fiscal to position you just like some of the customers that do sell time.
EndUser: Correct.
Agent: Because we do have a lot of customers that aren't necessarily selling the exact same thing, but they're a changeable object of selling is time. So consultation.
Agent: So I mean, we work with a lot of law firms, all these companies that don't actually offer something physical that would sit in someone's hands.
Agent: So with that being said, there's a multi, there's a myriad of tools that are going to be way more valuable for you. And even in this in terms of like what's in the [ORG-1] instance that we would exclude.
Agent: So there's not like an overwhelming amount of information that you're not using.
Agent: It's going to be very tailored to what you guys think is that matters throughout your sales cycle, your Marketing cycle, all those good things, your financial projection, those types of things.
EndUser: Yeah, no. Absolutely. No. You got it. And so you said through the fiscal.
EndUser: So are you my contact person over there for right now, [ORG-15] for?
Agent: Absolutely. The only way that someone will replace me is if I get promoted or is when I get promoted. So that won't be for [DATE-16] or two.
EndUser: Alright, okay, well cool.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Alright, well, I like that for sure.
Agent: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, I've got other partners. So like, you know, [FAC-1]'s a Marketing person, but we have like a complete Integration person.
Agent: Remember, I showed you the circle or like the little wheel of all the different clouds that we have?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: That's something we would dive into as we continue to perfect like your workflows, maybe something that's outside of Marketing and sales. So I've got conversations with companies. For instance, I have like an event company.
Agent: They do a lot of live events, they do a lot of webinars, and they want all their different systems because you know they're extremely digital to talk to each other.
Agent: Well, that's our company called [NORP-1], and now they do, you don't even have to have sales force. All they do is they go in and they connect everything so everything talks to each other.
Agent: Now it's not cheap, but it's definitely a different cloud that we offer.
EndUser: Hmm. Gotcha. Yeah, and I know, and that's what I'm just, I guess that's where I'm looking forward to, I guess [DATE-2] on that.
EndUser: And of course, everything I'm sure would work on some level, even with a, I guess, what would you call it, lower like a soft start, you know, just boom, let's just grab the sales and Marketing team and, you know, and we'll expand it to the other directors.
EndUser: I'm trying to think about the Implementation of it right now to get everything started because 68 people don't need it necessarily.
Agent: Right.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: But each one of those teams do have other seller doers and so I'm trying to think about how do this Implementation things go and then I say, alright, [PERSON-4], I guess I just need another 17 users type of thing.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Perp. Yes. So that's exactly right. That's the way to think of it, because that's the way I work with a lot of the clients that I'm working with now.
Agent: I literally have on [DATE-9], I have a conversation with a client that only has, I think, 10 users on the sales side, 10 users on the Marketing side, and now they want 10 more licenses for their sales team because they're growing.
Agent: Now, a Professional person that knows how to buy from [ORG-1] knows that [DATE-16], our [DATE-17] ends at [DATE-13]. So, we're like a month removed from [DATE-16].
EndUser: Okay. All
Agent: They know that we give you a lot more leniency on discounts at [DATE-18].
Agent: So he's like, let's wait till [DATE-21], because I want to talk to you guys in [DATE-21], whenever I know you're going to give me a bigger discount to get those 10 licenses.
Agent: But they're growing within what their means are there, right?
Agent: You know, they started with like five licenses and now they're up to a total of like 32. And they're a company of 132.
EndUser: Right. Well, look, yeah, I mean, if you're willing to make my, I mean, Because that's what I have right now, like on the pipe drive, right now I have four users, essentially.
EndUser: And it's just me, it's really just me, the reps and a general, a general login for the [ORG-9], like for [ORG-9].
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: So that way [PERSON-16] was able to, you know, Marketing that access to it essentially. And so pretty sure that's how it's set up. I'll put it at the double check it right here.
EndUser: And I mean, honestly, based off of that, I mean, the pricing really isn't that much different. Lloyd, I'm pretty sure.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Let me see. Manage users. So yeah, shoot, I'm even paying for somebody right now. So yeah, I technically have, I have four right now. That's it.
Agent: Yeah, so that's and that's so in that to give you a piece of mind or like piece of mind like that would.
Agent: Be absolutely in line with how we were expecting to start, right?
Agent: Even if you get separate on the Marketing side, you get like four or five people on the Marketing side, four or five people on the sales side. That's what we were expecting, you know, coming out of that conversation.
Agent: It's like to start slow and then build upon what we've got going on.
Agent: We've even had situations where, you know, maybe the incumbent like, you know, pipe drive is your your Contract set over for like a month or two.
EndUser: Gotcha.
Agent: We can figure out ways to just get one person in and start helping with the Implementation to build it all out. So once your contract's over, you can hit the ground routing.
EndUser: That's pretty interesting, [PERSON-16].
EndUser: It's a pretty interesting ecosystem that y'all have here, but I understand the reason why y'all take all this time is because you, in one, it's an inflow, right?
EndUser: It's a [DATE-16] Revenue generator, right?
EndUser: So every time you get somebody in with the fact that you know you're going to essentially help them grow, You get them in a door, even if it is for, you know, six, seven, eight hundred, because I'm sure on that call [DATE-25] for one for an hour and a half.
Agent: Right. Right.
EndUser: You had five different people there. You know, that's, that's expensive. Right. So, um, then you put, then you put all this together, but essentially it pays for itself just over time.
EndUser: And if everybody's using it for longer duration and then using more portions of it and growing and needing more.
EndUser: Why wouldn't you want to be a part of that?
EndUser: So then you go from whatever, $[MONEY-2] a month to, I mean, shoot, if they had 26 users, you know, it's [DATE-26], grand a month.
Agent: Exactly exactly because I got a buddy that owns a pool company and I can't remember what CRM he has the hates it and He's very Price conscious and as much as he wants to help me once make sure he's doing the right thing for his business Well, he's gonna start off with one license
EndUser: And which one would you start with him on that because that's interesting because I have other businesses to the Lord.
Agent: Okay Yeah, so I'm going to start him on the professional, which doesn't give him in the ability to integrate.
EndUser: I'm interested.
Agent: Because he just wants to see what this is all about first.
EndUser: Okay, gotcha.
Agent: Yeah. And so as much as he knows about [ORG-1], he's got this, you know, he's got a reserve because he's been burned by some of his other, by some of the other CRMs that he's tried out before.
Agent: So I was like, dude, just give it a try. You can cancel if you don't like it, but you go in with one license. And I guarantee he's gonna love it because.
Agent: He doesn't even have a help desk that he can call in to, but he pays for it.
Agent: And so when he calls in, he gets into a like a queue and then they call back like [DATE-21] and it's just something extremely simple that he just needs to change a field or something like that.
Agent: You'll have me as a live person, especially, and not only that, but everyone that you've already met on our calls is privy to anything that goes on.
Agent: And think about what we're trying to, you know, not necessarily sell you, but give you to grow your business.
Agent: Anytime that you say anything, all the people that are associated with your account, we're going to be notified through [ORG-6].
EndUser: Interesting.
Agent: Yeah, so everyone knows that I'm on this call. Everyone by [DATE-26] will have something that updates them through either email or their actual [ORG-6] instance that [ORG-16] a call.
EndUser: Huh.
Agent: Very intuitive. And then I'm actually right now put together a quick little email says, here's your quick overview of [ORG-6]. It's just a quick start guide to [ORG-6].
Agent: And then it's going to give me, I'm going to give you that newsletter.
Agent: And what that's going to do on my Slack instance is going to tell me, have you, so you talked about [ORG-6] that you want to create an opportunity for [ORG-6].
Agent: It's pretty crazy.
EndUser: Yeah, no, that's
EndUser: Very cool. That's all I got for it.
Agent: Yeah. But you can see that email come through any second now.
Agent: It gives it a second because... My Slack instances Recording what I sent out and even my bosses can see my leaders can see that I've reached out to you And it associated with the opportunity for the Sales Cloud But Marketing Cloud is a separate opportunity that's associated with your account So it'll also it'll also log that activity against both opportunities to show that there's been recent activity on that opportunity I mean, I gotcha.
EndUser: I mean, you make a very compelling case there, [ORG-16]Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And what's most interesting about it is that it's going to, it can grow with you.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And so
EndUser: Cool.
EndUser: All right, what else we got?
Agent: That's it. I just wanted to make sure to touch base with you understand like the buying process said pretty much you are the last guy but.
Agent: It sounds like your CEO or CFO would be the one signing it and just make sure that if you have your.
EndUser: Yes, yes. I can't sign a contract. I can't sign a Contract technically, but I can say yes, but I can say if I'll get you in touch with these people, but we can go from there.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: So.
Agent: And then I just wanted to make sure you had everything on my end that you could just going into a [DATE-3] conversation and if there are any reserves that I shared it with you and then I'll also.
Agent: Create another opportunity that says that talks a little bit about [ORG-6]. And then I just messaged everyone through [ORG-6] that it's really important that we talk a little bit more about Implementation come [DATE-2] as well.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Sound good?
EndUser: Sounds good, man.
Agent: All right, [ORG-5], I'll let you get back to it, but I appreciate your time. And we'll talk very soon. Please don't hesitate if you've got any questions about the email. I'll just head over to reach out to me.
EndUser: Not a worry. Thank you, man. Appreciate it.
Agent: All right. Thank you. Take care.

EndUser: So that we, you know, cause the gold is frankly in the follow up and you come highly recommended.
EndUser: So I'm hoping that you can meet our expectations and I was curious if you do you have some training on it?
Agent: Yeah, so sales force is a [PRODUCT-1], customer relationship management. What that means is exactly what you just mentioned is the ability to follow up and map out your current client base as well as your prospective client base.
Agent: So typically what we would do is we'd hop on and we'd chat through a very similar to this conversation.
Agent: You know, What lines of business do you operate in?
Agent: You mentioned a few of them. Also, what your budget for purchasing [PRODUCT-1] would be. That's a big part of it. Another piece is just understanding your use case for [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: And it sounds like what you folks need is the ability to cross-sell and upsell into your existing base across the services that you provide.
Agent: As well as have automated cadence to reach out to folks that are onboarding clients or current clients that you're looking to sell additionally to, right?
EndUser: Okay, I have my grandson on the phone and he's listening.
EndUser: Could you hear him?
EndUser: You hear it?
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Could you hear him?
Agent: Hey, how's it going?
EndUser: Yeah, we can both hear each other. So he was just, when you called me, he was just going to go over what he thought that we should start with with you.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And so did you want to step up here and talk to him?
EndUser: Hi [PERSON-5], I used the reason why I recommended [ORG-1] because where I used to work. We're the company who use [ORG-1] with bondage, as are what I call this, our dial, what I call this, our phone company.
EndUser: So what I'm looking for is what we have before, like email where we can check if people can have open their emails.
EndUser: We can customize our emails, so we don't have to type in the number in the email one by one.
EndUser: Or the birthdays, for example, organize what type of need for the... we can tag them, you know, according to what services they are in need for.
EndUser: And we can even one tap and send to all based on the templates that we created. We can send it to multiple people having a customized name on each, you know, so work efficient.
EndUser: See it connected with the bondage at the same time, those kind of things I'm looking for. And
Agent: Okay. And you mentioned.
EndUser: Also I forgot about the AI, where they can rip, respond, and check the activity of, for example, we're not around and we're not able to answer them. There's someone who's okay.
EndUser: Can a personal assistant can connect with them via email We have this as well, [ORG-6], I think.
Agent: Got. Okay.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Do you folks have a website?
EndUser: If we have a website, is that it?
Agent: Yeah, is there like a [PRODUCT-2] or something like that out there?
EndUser: Did you get up and running yet?
EndUser: We have a couple websites. We have one. We have the name as of the mean sign, but the website is... Please knock it up.
EndUser: Where still it's under construction, what we only have is the license currently and the [ORG-7] registered.
Agent: Okay, so you're still building out the initial website. Gotcha.
Agent: How long have you guys been in business?
EndUser: Well, I've been in business for almost 57, let me think. And I sound really yuck done.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I would say I've been in business for [DATE-6], probably. And I've been in a lot of businesses.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Everything know that I've ever done has been relationship building, but this is a brand new startup endeavor. I just made the. I have a holding company on an [ORG-8] and this is my DBA. Psalms, a PF 897.
EndUser: Principles that I have a lot of experience and so does my grandson.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: So how do you guys generate business as is?
Agent: Is it kind of like, like you said, you've been in business for [DATE-6], so you probably have a bunch of contacts?
EndUser: Yes, we have already contacts. We only ask of the meantime, need management. So we have a lot of leads already from different counties around the country. So we're just looking something that can manage it for us.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And kind of case. Was it one of the services that we provide is extremely time sensitive. And we do want to get this up and running and we are coordinating it with Monage.
EndUser: They said that they can integrate it. And so we already did that. And we're just anxious to get this started.
EndUser: And we can, did you know which thing you wanted us to start with, [PERSON-6], the starter suite?
EndUser: Or what do you think?
EndUser: I'm looking at a starter suite, but I think it's not going to have everything that I mentioned, so just the [ORG-6] email responder for us. and customize the whole email marketing.
EndUser: I don't know what that what project lines we are.
EndUser: Is [PERSON-7] going to be enough for what we need?
Agent: I didn't catch what you said there is starter going to be enough.
EndUser: Is that what you He wanted to know if you thought we needed more than starter to get started.
Agent: [PERSON-8]?
Agent: Well, if you do have an API with [ORG-9] and then you're thinking about the automated email tracking as well as the email marketing, I'm not sure if that's exactly what what you mentioned.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Then, um, Starter is not going to include all of that functionality. There's a couple different products that come to mind that I would recommend to you folks.
EndUser: Okay, great. Do that. All your.
Agent: It would be most likely Enterprise licenses with Pardot. Pardot is the automated email Outreach function. So you can create. as many sequences as you want and run ongoing email drip campaigns that are entirely automated.
Agent: So like you said, there's time sensitive aspects to some of the services you provide. You don't even have to sit there at your computer to get some of these steps in action.
Agent: As soon as, let's say, paperwork is submitted by a customer, then you can already have that automated email sent out to thank them for the stuff that you've been asking for them or put them into the, give them the next steps in the service offering.
EndUser: Mm.
Agent: However, you guys would want to cater that to, to how you do business across your service line.
EndUser: Do you like that one, [PERSON-6]?
EndUser: Yeah, but it sounds huge for us at the moment. There's only two currently. um, employee and their discompany.
EndUser: And so I don't know if that's going to be efficient for us, [PERSON-5], if you can help us, um, is there something like, If not, is that the, what you recommend for us based on what we asked for?
EndUser: Or is the employees?
Agent: Yeah, that's... Well, yeah, based on what you're asking for, then those product lines would have all of the functionality necessary.
Agent: But considering you're at two employees and you're likely going to experience a significant amount of growth, and what it sounds like is the top priority is managing your current contact list.
Agent: So just understanding, hey, who has one product?
Agent: Where are all your emails?
Agent: What stage are they in, you know, when's the last time we reached out to them?
Agent: What was the communication like?
Agent: So just follow up being the first and foremost. I'm sure we could get away with two Professional edition licenses. Starter is, I guess that you guys would grow out of starter pretty quickly.
Agent: So we'd definitely be able to get you Professional edition licenses. at a really great rate considering [DATE-7]'s are end of fiscal and it shouldn't be a very difficult stand up.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: But I would suggest a crawl, walk, run approach because one, I don't want to be overwhelming, sales force can easily become overwhelming because we have so many products and get a little bit complicated.
Agent: But I would say first and foremost, let's think about the contact management and the Outreach management.
Agent: And then as you folks get more familiar with how to use [ORG-1], then we can talk about higher level Enterprise type offerings like [ORG-10]. And maybe upgrades to give you the [ORG-6] functionality that you were talking about.
Agent: The [ORG-6] functionality does come at a pretty premium price point.
EndUser: You
Agent: And I think maybe we're not [PERCENT-1] there yet if we're thinking about going with [ORG-1].
EndUser: See.
EndUser: Well, I'm not sure we need to.
EndUser: We just need one case. I'll be the one two manage. Maybe later on we can.
EndUser: You are the contact person from this point forward right?
Agent: Yes.
EndUser: [PERSON-5] or are we going to have another sales contact in the
Agent: No, no, I'll be the contact moving forward on your account executive and whole point of contact here.
EndUser: Future?
Agent: [PERCENT-1].
EndUser: Okay. I like that because it's very important that way you can help us develop our scaling up strategy with your services that you provide.
EndUser: But in the beginning, I think [PERSON-6], wouldn't we just need one?
EndUser: Yes, I agree with you. Adjust one for the meantime.
EndUser: Is that possible?
Agent: Yeah, yeah, that's totally possible. There's no minimum spend with [ORG-1]. It just.
EndUser: That's amazing.
Agent: There's a.
EndUser: I'm also gonna be speaking to the people that you... He's my manager and I would just not feel comfortable right now.
EndUser: I have so much on my plate that I can't, I think I need him to show me, help me get familiar with it, and then we can add on, you know, and go forward because we are going to have a team in the future.
EndUser: But right now it's really just the two of them, just because we're both really hard workers, It's the two of us and we have one particular thing we want to be focused on initially, but we know that we're going to be when you gain trust with people that they're going to want these other products.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And we're not going to be initially the list that we have. We're going to be working in every state in [GPE-3] in different counties. So we definitely need something to keep everyone.
EndUser: Sorted out because it's a very personal kind of service that we're providing and if they don't.
EndUser: If we don't follow up quickly on the right time for them and, you know, they could lose out there, they would have no recourse to go back and try to get what we're helping them receive.
EndUser: So I think it's, don't you think we'd be okay with just one two start with [PERSON-6]?
Agent: Quick question there.
Agent: So if there's only one license, then there's only going to be one login, right?
Agent: So if if [PERSON-1] has, you know, folks that she's speaking to directly, and then I'm sorry, what was your name?
EndUser: Angel.
Agent: [PERSON-6]. Yeah, sorry about that.
Agent: So if, if [PERSON-1]'s in the system and let's say, you know, [PERSON-1], you sent out some emails, you made some phone calls, you changed some things, and then you know, that's under [PERSON-6]'s name within the system.
Agent: And then [PERSON-6]'s going back and he doesn't, you know, necessarily remember exactly what [PERSON-1] did. That's kind of a, it's pretty counterintuitive.
Agent: And the pricing on two licenses is negligible compared to, you know, going with one and then having to kind of sift through, hey, who actually did what within [ORG-1]?
Agent: So I would definitely recommend starting with two. One so that you both actually get. familiar with [ORG-1] and start creating a system around how you, you know, customize and use your CRM over time. That's just my recommendation.
Agent: If you folks, you know, have pushback on, hey, we just want one log in for [ORG-1] and then we'll figure out, you know, the who's who of inside the system. That's totally okay. Just wouldn't recommend it.
EndUser: Thank you so much. Oh, that's been thank you so much for. Yeah, when we had a startup company started, we were able to solve that problem through the transcription, Recorded transcription through [ORG-9].
EndUser: And later on, we scaled up for make sure that each has its own logins. So for the meantime, I am the admin assistant kind of of. of my grandma [PERSON-1] here.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: So, you know, she's gonna have a hard time doing the admin task and just focus on, you know, [DATE-8], getting her help back, for example. So, for the meantime, we're just gonna have one.
EndUser: And for the inputs, I'm gonna take advantage of the Recorded session and transcription from a phone call through Bonnage.
EndUser: And they, we set up, they're setting us up But we get from you will be integrated with our phone calls. I'm basically going to be talking to people on the phone.
EndUser: And he's going to be doing the rest of it.
EndUser: So does that make sense?
Agent: Okay. Yep, that makes sense. That definitely makes sense to me. No, I don't see any problem with that.
Agent: I mean, if you guys weren't basically a family business, then, you know, and let's say one of you was, you know, across the country and, you know, you'd just been hired on.
Agent: I would recommend against it a little bit more than that, but given what you guys have told me so far, I think what... You know, single license, Professional edition.
Agent: I have to confirm with, I'm going to add our partner to the call. His name is [PERSON-9]. And he would be the one who actually set up [ORG-1] for you folks.
Agent: So he would take care of the relationship between [ORG-1] and [ORG-9] from the [ORG-1] side.
EndUser: Okay, and the question that I have for you, I
EndUser: Know my grandson's very conservative, but would we be better off since it would be one license to do the enterprise?
Agent: That, yeah, I think that's a fair question for sure. And based on, I'd like to get [PERSON-10]'s take on it because he's been working with [ORG-1] for, I'd say, 9 at this point.
Agent: He's a long-term Implementation partner with the company.
EndUser: Okay. Mm.
Agent: I think it probably would make sense to get the Enterprise version. One, because you guys would get an incredible price point on it. You wouldn't have to worry about APIs.
Agent: In Professional edition, there's going to be limitations to what you can actually connect to [ORG-1]. There's only going to be five APIs available. Enterprise is unlimited. The amount of storage that you're going to get, much better with enterprise.
Agent: All in all, it's kind of our standard licensing.
EndUser: Bye.
Agent: Sometimes we go with Professional edition really are price-averse and they don't have very many APIs, they don't want to integrate with bondage or anything.
EndUser: What are API products?
Agent: Api is a, think of it like a digital bridge between one software company or one software product to the next.
Agent: So all it would be is think of like we're playing telephone and we have the two cans with the string between them.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: So it's one can with the string from the tree house back to the house, the house being you folks and your use with [ORG-1] and the tree house being [ORG-9].
EndUser: Right.
Agent: That little string right there. That's called an API in software terms. But it's just a digital.
EndUser: Oh, okay, so let me explain something.
EndUser: Some, or [ORG-13], [ORG-9], principles is, that is actually, I have a whole company which has an [ORG-8], which I am licensed in the state of [GPE-4], but it's, these are all our products are anywhere in the [GPE-5], anywhere.
EndUser: Yeah, I know.
EndUser: The thing is, we are, this is our company company, but we also have products under independent contractor status that have software that give us, you know, different things that are different companies, but we're working the business together because they're so synergistic.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: That if you establish the trust from a person from this one company under 977, they're going to want the products that we have in the other ones.
EndUser: I mean, there's just several, there's really, how do I explain it, [PERSON-6]?
EndUser: We have two for sure companies, one company that we are independent contractors on. under if I gave one stop company for business. business services.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And we have a second company that is a banking platform that it's called [ORG-13].
EndUser: And that one is more like a benefit or a blessing that we can offer to any of our established clients, where they make it really simple, where they can use their money twice.
EndUser: So if they spend something with us here, or if they tie to their church, they're going to get coupons equal to a really old. So back in [DATE-4], we used to have green stamps.
EndUser: If we bought stuff at the supermarket, we got green stamps. We put them in the book. We could go to the green stamp store and we could use the stamps to buy products.
EndUser: When it's money, we already spent for food.
EndUser: Does that make sense?
EndUser: So that's the second. That's the second actual business entity that we are in. We have digital branch offices in that where we're just trying to help as many people as we can.
EndUser: And then so the first one is kind of a covers all the [ORG-4] grants, the [ORG-13] grants, you know, commercial using tax credits for businesses to get their solar up and running.
Agent: Mm.
EndUser: And we work with [ORG-9]'s comp insurance plans. So all that's under one company than the banking platform.
EndUser: But the initial thing that we're using this for that is so time sensitive, when we reach out to a client, they have a matter of [DATE-9] before they're going to lose the service that we're offering them.
EndUser: And it's so critical that we have follow up. And not lose anybody, you know, I just think the [PRODUCT-1] is so important for that.
EndUser: Does that make sense?
Agent: Yeah, of course.
EndUser: There is something. Oh wait, I just wanted to say something. Go ahead. I want to interject says here under Enterprise web service. It says additional $[MONEY-2] per user per month. So we don't have any web services. And professional.
EndUser: Is that what I mean?
Agent: Yeah, there's going to be limitations to professional, especially around the API and amount of storage
EndUser: What my grandma is telling is we wanted to connect to different businesses and let's say lead generation through email Marketing or subscription from our website.
EndUser: Will we be able to do that under professional?
EndUser: For example, grandma was talking about [ORG-13], people interested in [ORG-13]. science in our website, would it be integrated to [ORG-1] using Professional where there are leads will go connected to, you know, to the [ORG-1] database.
Agent: I'm not entirely sure. I don't want to give you the wrong answer right there. But I do have resources.
Agent: I've added [PERSON-9] to our call [DATE-2], where we're going to be able to get a little bit more into the weeds on the technicals.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Of the differences between Professional addition and Enterprise addition. And believe me, if Professional makes the most sense, then we'll definitely move forward with Professional free folks. However, if there's limitations that push you towards enterprise, then no worries.
EndUser: Oh, and you're talking about special pricing. We didn't know their special pricing. So that special pricing for grandma's.
Agent: Yeah, this is a, So so and and pricing for [DATE-10] and this is one of the best times to purchase from [ORG-1].
EndUser: And break. Okay.
Agent: [DATE-7] is the wonderful time because it's the absolute end of [DATE-13] for us right now. And we, you know, we love to do, you know, quick, quick add-on business towards [DATE-9].
Agent: So if you folks are looking to move forward with us in [DATE-7], then I'll go through the approval process to see you know, what concessions can be made in [DATE-7].
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Typically, they're wonderful price points.
EndUser: So you think it might be very possible that with the. You're moving the screen and I'm getting off. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was going to say. The enterprises, that's the one for 97.
Agent: Yeah, that's the sticker price for enterprise, yeah.
EndUser: Okay, so it sounds like if we have, if we did two, the user, if to help me if the additional user, except for logging in, or what does that mean?
EndUser: The $[MONEY-2] extra, where that goes.
Agent: Yeah, so
Agent: You can't have separate versions of [ORG-1], right?
Agent: So if you pick to go forward with starter edition, Professional or enterprise, all of your licenses will have to be that license type. You can't have, you know, like a mixed bag.
EndUser: Oh, okay. Well, that sounds not as comprehensive.
EndUser: So, what I'm saying here is because we want to go with you and we want to do it as soon as possible because we just got, we should have everything up and running in [DATE-13] or two with [PERSON-13] And.
Agent: I think if it makes sense for you guys, we could have this all figured out down to every possible stone unturned by [DATE-13].
EndUser: Oh, okay. That would be great. That would be great. And then you're in a rush because I had to ask one last question and that's because I'm another one.
Agent: Is that I'm not in the rush. I do have one last question for you guys too, but go right ahead.
EndUser: Ok?
EndUser: Oh, good. You can go first. We want to understand more that's like we asked if there are seminars and I can see here as standard success plan.
Agent: All right. Mm hmm.
EndUser: It included both licenses.
EndUser: This is a training, right?
EndUser: And there's premier success plan.
EndUser: Can you explain that further based on what plan we choose?
EndUser: It seems like it's it depends upon what plan we get. We have an alternative coaching somehow or training session. We do need to explain that for.
Agent: Yeah, so the premier success is an additional add-on, you know, it does cost additional to your contract price for premier success. But what that means is you'll have 25-7 white glove support from [ORG-1].
Agent: There's going to be a bunch of additional information, so articles and web series that you can subscribe to. So if you didn't understand one thing or the other.
Agent: You can just call in to the [ORG-1] helpline and somebody will get on the phone with you immediately and start working through, let's say, you couldn't find a certain button or you got stuck somewhere within [ORG-1] and you don't know why, let's say a contact isn't moving from one stage to the other.
Agent: Premier [PERSON-9] gives you the opportunity to, let's say if you're very new to [ORG-1], it gives you the opportunity to have that support. throughout [DATE-9] of your contract.
Agent: A lot of folks, when they sign up with [ORG-1], they'll go with Premier [PERSON-9] for [DATE-9].
Agent: One is just kind of like an insurance policy of like, hey, I don't wanna get stuck not knowing what to do. And I wanna have somebody that's gonna answer me and help me right away.
Agent: So they'll have Premier [PERSON-9] for [DATE-9]. And then they'll drop it off their contract that following year.
EndUser: I'm sorry.
Agent: Entirely up to you folks if you'd like to go with that. There's also, you know, [PERSON-9], he's one of our Implementation partners. He provides a significant amount of customization and training as well.
Agent: So we can chat with him [DATE-2].
Agent: He's going to be on the call and see if you folks are going to be comfortable with his timeline of training or, you know, if you did want to go with Premier's success, more than happy to set that up for you folks.
Agent: It should be a pretty nominal cost considering the license sizing that you guys are going to go with.
EndUser: Okay. All right. Well, that'll be good for [DATE-2] because like this was an extra special call for me. We were anticipating we were just kind of going over it when you called about what do we need.
EndUser: So this will give us a chance to do a more in-depth analysis of it and be prepared for you [DATE-2]. So when we signed up with OneAge, we have a [DATE-13] contract, but we pay [DATE-9].
EndUser: Would it be something like that?
EndUser: So I wouldn't have to come up with [DATE-22] in advance or who have to come up with [DATE-22].
Agent: That is something that I have to go up to my manager and he's probably going to have to ask his manager.
Agent: Typically, we don't make concessions around billing, but if it's something that's going to stop you folks from being able to move forward with us, then I'm thinking it's very possible to move to [DATE-16] billing so that you can chunk it out throughout [DATE-22] instead of having an upfront cost.
EndUser: Oh, okay. Well, that's interesting.
EndUser: So, go Backup to the plan that you liked the best, which was the enterprise, right?
EndUser: If you go to that one. Um.
EndUser: So would it be like 137 times 9?
EndUser: Or are you talking it will be somewhat less because of the timing in your [DATE-9]?
Agent: Yeah, so 91, that's the sticker price, so [DATE-16] for [DATE-22]. But I'll go and I'll ask for discounts for you folks.
Agent: If you guys are willing to sign with us by, let's say [DATE-16], then I'll come back to you with the best pricing, best discounts that are offered for [DATE-22].
EndUser: Oh, okay, well that's good. We should definitely get a discount for being nice.
Agent: Yeah, of course [PERCENT-1].
EndUser: All right, well, listen, I have I have a technician coming to the house [DATE-2]. You know how they do is like between 9 and two, but I have a laptop.
EndUser: He's installing a phone for the desk for me, and it should not interfere, because I'm not gonna be doing anything, but I have to let him in. So I just wanted two forewarn you.
EndUser: I might have to be off the line for just a moment.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Well, I'm in the door, but the chances of him coming exactly when you guys call me is very, would be very surprising.
Agent: That's
EndUser: So, and he's only going to be here for [TIME-2], but he has till [TIME-3] to be here.
Agent: Really good. [PERSON-6], are
EndUser: So, yeah, he'll be on with us.
Agent: You on the call [DATE-2]?
Agent: Okay. That's really good.
Agent: [PERSON-6], are you on the call [DATE-2]?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: And last question for me is, do you folks have some degree of budget, you know, upset aside for this project?
EndUser: Yes, I do.
EndUser: I would really prefer to have the [DATE-16], then to have everything in one, simply because with this new business that I just set up, you know, with a new business, start up, you know, a lot of initial expenses.
EndUser: And within 16, within [DATE-25], because we want to get this launched as quickly as possible, I was hoping we could make a decision [DATE-2] and you thought you could get everything ready by [DATE-27].
EndUser: We really want to start making phone calls to these people because we don't want them to lose out.
EndUser: But it's kind of a thing where when we collect the money, it's not instantaneous because we have to go through, put them through a program when we find their money.
EndUser: And we have to be very on top of it on time. And we should be getting paid, you know, after the phone call anytime. you know, [DATE-27]. So that would be better for me.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I don't know if I had to.
EndUser: I can pay for [DATE-16] upfront that I really prefer not to because I just think it's wise to have a little emergency while we're waiting for the money to come in because this is a although I'm old, this is a new project for me.
EndUser: And I spent quite a lot of money to be trained and for the two of us to be ready to go. But we didn't really want to pull the trigger until we had. your sales force in place.
Agent: Yep.
Agent: Would you folks mind if I make the meeting [DATE-2] for [TIME-4]?
Agent: Instead of, OK, yeah, I'll do that just so that we have ample time.
EndUser: Oh, that's okay. Yeah.
Agent: I'm sure [PERSON-10]'s going to be able to. pop open sales force and we can look at a quick little demo as well as, you know, hash out all the technicals.
Agent: So just to set up a quick timeline for us, we're going to meet with [PERSON-10] [DATE-2]. We're going to look through sales force.
Agent: We're going to align on what type of licensing you guys would want, what sort of connections with any other software or company that you need to have.
Agent: And then from there, Pretty much all that there's left to do is just show you guys what sort of discount I can grab and then send you guys over a docuSign so that so.
EndUser: Okay, so let me ask you a question.
EndUser: You guys are familiar, obviously, right, with [ORG-9] and [ORG-9] should not be an issue, should it?
Agent: No, absolutely not.
EndUser: Okay. All right, good, because we already signed up and committed to them for [DATE-22].
Agent: Yeah, at this point, everybody integrates with [ORG-1]. [ORG-1], they've been around for quite some time.
Agent: And if there is an Integration that exists, then we have an open API system that makes it very easy to build integrations very quickly. But I just did a quick [ORG-22] search.
Agent: And yeah, we definitely have an open API with [ORG-9]. And so it should tick and tie very nicely.
EndUser: Okay, I think I have one more question if I didn't escape my brain. Just give me a moment.
Agent: .
EndUser: So when we have our [PRODUCT-1], we have it if something happens to grandma, I want everything to continue.
EndUser: And I also wanted to know, so this, we can download our [PRODUCT-1] onto our computers, right?
EndUser: And if we, for any reason after [DATE-22], [DATE-37] [DATE-36], we are no longer going to be In the business, are we able to transfer the contract with you to someone else?
EndUser: Will they be able to access it?
EndUser: Like an exit strategy?
Agent: Yeah, so the way that you would exit sales force. is everything that you put into the [PRODUCT-1], that is [PERCENT-1] your data, there is a [PRODUCT-3] download file.
Agent: So you can export a CSV file, it's gonna have every single contact data point, all of the information that you interface with in [ORG-1], you can download it right out of there, or you can keep your contract open and let's say you wanted to move to a different provider, you would just have [ORG-1] open and then sync with [ORG-1] to your new [PRODUCT-1] provider.
Agent: And essentially just download all of the information out of [ORG-1] into your new provider and then after that close out your account with us.
EndUser: Okay, well I was thinking more in terms of, well another question I guess was like, with this one company that we're with, they have a [PRODUCT-1] in there, would we be able to export it into [ORG-1]?
Agent: Mm hmm.
Agent: So that's something that [PERSON-10] offers as a service too, where if you have a bunch of existing data that you wanted to map into [ORG-1] and you wanted to show up in a certain way, like basically customize it a little bit, where, let's say you don't use the same terms like contacts and opportunities and sales stages, you have different terms that you are more familiar with or fit your business better.
Agent: [PERSON-10] would remap your [ORG-1] instance and then take that data that you have that's existing in your other CRM instance and you would just have [PERSON-10] do the entire upload for you. That's part of his implementation.
Agent: And just to call out there is an additional fee with having an Implementation partner but that's the only way that you can actually set up [ORG-1].
EndUser: Okay. All right, so [TIME-5] and you'd like me to blank out [TIME-6]. <inaudible>. And then if it takes less time.
Agent: Determines
EndUser: Um, that's okay. We don't want to have to get off the phone. Let me just one more month. I'm looking at my current [ORG-22] calendar [DATE-34] [DATE-26]. All right.
EndUser: Okay, we're good. I just checked my calendar. So I'll be able to give you an hour and intro will be will be here with me on the on the call.
Agent: Okay, perfect.
Agent: Wonderful. Well, I'm so glad that we were able to chat [DATE-1]. I think this is definitely gonna speed us along for [DATE-2]. I hope that I was able to answer all of you folks's questions up front.
Agent: Obviously, we have some follow up stuff that we're gonna understand from [PERSON-10] [DATE-2]. But thanks again for you folks's time and looking forward to chatting [DATE-2].
EndUser: Okay, one more question. If we start out with the second one, not the first is out of the question, but the second one.
EndUser: And would we be able to upgrade during [DATE-22] to the more expensive one?
Agent: That is definitely an option, yeah.
EndUser: Okay, great. All right. Thank you.
Agent: Okay, perfect news.
EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: Folks, great meeting you and looking forward to chatting [DATE-2].
EndUser: Okay. Bye bye.

voice_15658_167_0LQ3y000009h34cGAA,"Agent: Hi, [ORG-1], this is [PERSON-1] from [ORG-2].
Agent: How are you?
EndUser: Hey, hold on [TIME-1], once. OK, go ahead. Now you're good.
Agent: No worries, I know we had time on the calendar to connect right now.
Agent: Are you still available?
Agent: Because I'm on [EVENT-1]. But if it's easier to reschedule, we can do that as well.
EndUser: Oh, OK. The way she said it, she made it sound like that it was over the phone, not actually on [ORG-3].
Agent: We can meet over the phone if that's easier as well. Whatever you want to do.
EndUser: Well, I mean, we can do over the phone or I can pull over and pull out my laptop and we do Google Meet. Don't matter to me.
Agent: No. Yeah, we can just talk here then.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Perfect. So I saw you were taking a look at sales force and I just wanted to get a better understanding of.
Agent: You know, what your company does, you know, what your role is, how you guys are building revenue and making money and potentially, you know, what petite what keeps your interest in sales for.
EndUser: Got you. I'm an insurance agency relatively large insurance agency and what I do to generate revenue is I have ads and leads and stuff like that.
EndUser: Actually with this free trial that I have I put my software engineer same omen. and got them to make some changes and them to reprogram some things and kind of just see how we like it.
EndUser: So I guess that's kind of where we are right now with it.
EndUser: But I'm using it as a CRM system, kind of logged my leads and all that stuff and several other things like that I've just got my team working on right now.
Agent: Got it. That's super helpful, especially to get a better understanding of how you are using the platform.
Agent: I guess I'd be curious, since you guys are on the free trial like Are you then planning to move forward with [ORG-2]?
Agent: Are you evaluating other CRNs?
Agent: Are you looking to be able to do, like have specific functionality with [ORG-2]?
Agent: Like kind of want to... No, no, that was pretty much all the questions I had.
EndUser: Oh, I'll go ahead.
EndUser: Oh, no, I'm evaluating about six or seven different [PRODUCT-1] systems at this time. All of them which are being made and that's worked on by my engineering team.
EndUser: I kind of gave them some set instructions on what I want and It's kind of right now. It's a matter of what can provide me the best price and who can do the most things for me.
EndUser: Something I liked about [ORG-2], I like the customization features and just how much can be redesigned by my engineering team and how they can kind of. make it look however I want to.
EndUser: And they, because I've seen some really good things that they were able to produce for me using the platform. So I guess that's one thing they really liked about it. But yes, I'm currently evaluating others as well.
Agent: Okay, so yeah, that definitely makes sense.
Agent: And when I talk to a lot of my clients, they tend to, like you said, evaluate other platforms and how to get an understanding of, you know, like what you like, what user-friendly, etc.
Agent: So with that being said, I would be curious to kind of like go back for a second. You mentioned that you are getting customers and new business from some of the grads in [ORG-4].
Agent: But I'm curious, you know, how many [ORG-5] are you getting [DATE-1] and then where are you finding most of them?
EndUser: Well, I can't really answer some of that because I have a lead generation team that does that, but I know I generate about six or seven thousand leads a month.
Agent: Wow, that's a lot.
Agent: And as of right now, without the serums, how have you been going about like reaching out to them and working them?
EndUser: Without the CRM, I just have a different. team that does that, they manage that all in their own system. It's not really any [PRODUCT-1] or anything like that. It's just a
EndUser: A standard of [PRODUCT-2] based system that my software engineer team built for that purpose.
Agent: Got it. So it sounds like you have essentially like a marketing team. You have your engineering team and then sorry I made it [DATE-2] the CEO or what is your title.
EndUser: I'm the owner.
Agent: Owner. Okay. Yeah. And do you have a separate sales team and customer service team as well.
EndUser: I kind of, yes and no. I mean, they, every, the way I designed this company, I designed it where everybody in the [ORG-6] helps out each other. So they're really, I never put any job description specifics on there.
EndUser: So at [DATE-3], everybody does the same job, but everybody has their own specialty that they do.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Maybe they do [PERCENT-1] customer service. and [PERCENT-2] customer retention, or maybe they do [PERCENT-3] lead generation and maybe [PERCENT-2] customer service and [PERCENT-2] management. So, you know, they've got a specialty, but they don't have a set job.
Agent: Got it. And everyone's kind of wearing multiple hats. But like you said, kind of focusing where their skill set is.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: Right.
Agent: And how many people is how many people are in your company?
EndUser: At this time is about to be 34.
Agent: It Wow, that's exciting.
Agent: How long have you owned the company?
EndUser: Is a little over two and a half years.
Agent: Wow, that's a ton of growth for [DATE-4]. Exciting.
EndUser: It is.
Agent: Yeah, well, that's so cool. So, so you mentioned you, you have the team. You have some people that will focus a chunk of their time, you know, working the leads and then other people will also chip in there.
Agent: Can you talk to me a little bit more about when someone decides to work with you with the onboarding process looks like?
EndUser: They send me their resume. I followed up and throw it in the trash and then I asked them for an in-person interview.
EndUser: And if I like their personality, I hire them and I put them in a position based off of what I think their personality is. I mean, it really is that simple.
EndUser: There's not any paperwork or specific things that they go through. And then I just have engineering team madam and all the systems.
Agent: Sorry, I meant when you find like out of those six or 7,000 means you get [DATE-1], like they once one of the marketing people reaches out to them and they want to move forward with your agency.
Agent: Can you talk me through that onboarding process?
EndUser: Oh, oh, I'm okay. I thought you were talking about my employee.
Agent: No, sorry for the mix up there.
EndUser: Okay, when you said onboarding, it made me think of hiring an employee. So when they want to get with the company,
EndUser: I mean, the lead generation team, they kind of get the leads in my callers, or I mean, that'll have a specific name for them, but they don't. that team or specialty or whatever you want to call it.
EndUser: They call those people and they ask them what they need with insurance and if they need any at that time.
EndUser: And like for example, I was telling them [DATE-5] and I would like to look at the person.
EndUser: Cheaper auto insurance or if they're business, you know, you kind of have already have an idea of what they're looking for because the leads show it.
Agent: Okay,
EndUser: But then after that, you just write that policy through first [ORG-7] and then you update it into your account exactly what they had.
Agent: You know, that makes sense.
Agent: And then, are these relationships, like you said, so someone moves forward with they want, you know, the cheaper auto insurance?
Agent: Are those relationships like more transactional?
Agent: It's, I would assume that they're a bit longer term. and you're working a bit closer with them.
Agent: But yeah, can you describe to me what that relationship is like between clients and the maybe the customer service team?
EndUser: I'm not really sure I'm following what you're asking.
EndUser: I mean, could you elaborate a little bit?
Agent: Yeah, so like say I called in [DATE-6] and I decided to buy auto insurance.
Agent: Like, how are you guys keeping in touch with me and like, If I have a question, how do I reach out to you all?
Agent: Is it through the website?
Agent: Am I calling you, emailing you?
Agent: What does that look like?
EndUser: Okay, so we got two options there. One is where you can just call us directly. We don't have a website. I don't do that. And yes, I've got multiple reasons for doing that, but I've observed that that's. Okay.
EndUser: [TIME-2].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Okay, much better. Now, so. We give all that via email like we give all that contact information via an email.
EndUser: When they get a policy from a so they have the ability to reach out to us via phone or email.
Agent: And how do you, how does your team reach out to those clients to like upsell them on additional policies?
EndUser: Email and phone but we don't we don't sell additional policy because we're strong enough we don't have to do that and I know that upselling is a thing.
EndUser: But the services we provide kind of act in a perpetual motion. So when they need service, extra service, then they come to us anyway. So we really don't ever go looking for that type of business.
Agent: Oh, that's super nice that people just, like you said, typically come to you and you guys don't have to spend too much time like hunting for that business.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: Yeah. And so I guess my biggest question is, like you said, some people spend [PERCENT-1] of their time in the lead generation and [PERCENT-4] of their time other places.
Agent: How does everyone keep track of different client information?
Agent: Where are you keeping track of a profile on one of your clients and what policies they have and their contact information and then how is that getting passed along from teenage to teenage?
EndUser: Our proprietary software that we developed all that all that is handled in our own I guess you could call it a CRM system, but it's not It's just really a record-keeping system.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: So we contain all that on proprietary servers and technology. We
Agent: Got it.
Agent: So I guess my question is like, if someone called in say [DATE-6], but then emailed [DATE-7], like where in that system is that where you would have track of like, oh, they reached out and they had these engagements over [DATE-8] or do you not have that record of activity tracking.
EndUser: Keep all those records.
Agent: Okay, I got it.
EndUser: Yeah, we keep anytime a phone call comes in, it records it, it logs it, it does all that. I mean, it does everything. Anything you can think of. Uh, it'll do.
Agent: Okay, and I guess my question is to you, like what else would you be looking to do with a [PRODUCT-1]?
Agent: Because of course, like one of the pluses of [ORG-2] is how easy it is to collaborate across different types of teams. how you're able to track the different activity, and then you have a lot in terms of leads.
Agent: So being able to prioritize your time with the best leads, the best accounts, et cetera. But I just be curious too, because it sounds like you already are evaluating different CRNs. You have your own software.
Agent: What are the gaps that you're looking to fill?
EndUser: Well, I'm looking, in all honesty, I'm looking at something that I am not going to have to maintain or pay someone to maintain 23-7. because our own proprietary software, it's great, it's awesome.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, it can, and it's fully customizable. There's nobody that can tell you know that you can't do that, that's not possible because if it's not at that time, we can make it possible.
EndUser: And, but when there's a bug in the software or something like that, an error on a server or something like that, That can take up, I saw it one time, take [TIME-3] to go and hunt down that bug or that dead server partition.
EndUser: And fix it.
Agent: Mom.
EndUser: And it's really just the availability.
EndUser: Now, I mean, the software is bulletproof itself, but stuff that are outside of our control, like the servers that we operate on, which are all based, and they have their own proprietary company that they operate with.
EndUser: We're just looking for something more, maybe a little bit more bulletproof.
EndUser: So really the only requirement here is something that's very customizable and that we can make it our own and something that just has a little bit more server availability.
Agent: Yeah. That definitely makes sense. And when you talk about customizable, that's of course, you know, one of our big selling points is that you can go in and like build the flows yourself.
Agent: You can create the different fields and different objects. So your orange to your point is very customizable. And then it's also very easy to scale.
Agent: It just sounds like based on the growth that you've had over [DATE-9], like, are you guys planning to grow the company more over [DATE-10] two [DATE-9]?
EndUser: Yes, absolutely. In near [DATE-14], we, well, right now we do, but near [DATE-14], I'm going to have almost 594 employees.
Agent: Oh.
EndUser: If you combine both remote and full time, and I'll have 23. Thank you.
EndUser: Yeah, 23 different locations across [GPE-1].
Agent: Wow, that is crazy. That's so exciting. So you guys already have the plans and projects for that growth plan then.
EndUser: Absolutely. Yeah, I have a different team that does that. They're just my business strategy team.
Agent: Got it. Yeah, so it sounds like moving over getting like you said, it's here in place, but like updating the real-time secure customizable as part of that growth plan.
Agent: So you guys can like work on those leads more grow the sales team, etc. Right.
EndUser: Absolutely.
Agent: Okay. Well, this is super helpful. I still have a few more questions for you. So you mentioned the proprietary software that you have.
Agent: I'm curious, like what other systems would you want sales force to connect to?
Agent: Because again, I have a lot of clients that when they start out as maybe like a four or five person agency, they're completely on sales force.
Agent: But as they grow, they'll want to be able to integrate to maybe like a phone system or they're integrating, again, just to other systems.
Agent: Like a doc, you sign like, I'd be curious what other systems you would be looking to connect to.
EndUser: Stuff like [ORG-8] and my engineering they've already I've already seen that in action [DATE-6] actually they were showing me what they've done so far and we we've already integrated into like [ORG-9] and stuff like that and [ORG-8] email transfers a button so I can so we can just leave through a document I mean you know that that's the That's all that stuff, you know, is really just simple stuff.
EndUser: And we'll probably integrate other things later on down the road when we decide to.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: But like I said, it's kind of a Competition game right now because it's, I am evaluating other CRMs. And I'm looking for pride. I do not ever, and this is nothing to anyone.
EndUser: This is just something that's happened to me. I guess I can mention this.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: I do not pay [DATE-13]. I had something happen one time during this career, and it really burned me. So I don't pay [DATE-13]. Some do. Some don't. But I just don't need the deal breaker.
Agent: Yeah, no. Well, I appreciate the context and the transparency and that stuff and at least something that we have a lot of flexibility on so we can definitely work on that.
Agent: But yeah, I totally understand what you're coming from, especially after you have an experience like that. It's good to have your non-negotiable. Yeah.
EndUser: That's really the only thing that I just, it really is just a me thing. It's just something that I just cannot personally work around. And it's a company burned me one time and they didn't, I didn't like it.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And there was some issues with that company and it turned into a lawsuit. So I just don't do. [DATE-13] after that and so.
Agent: That's crazy. Well, yeah, we can definitely salesforce. We do [DATE-13] and [DATE-16] billing, so that definitely won't be an issue.
Agent: But I'm curious, like, when you were thinking about salesforce versus these competitors, like, I guess my question is, like, why would you decide to go with salesforce versus some of these other systems and vice versa?
EndUser: Well, I mean, the most simple answer on why would I go with a... Another one is because
EndUser: Some of these are free. Some of these are open source and they compete with [ORG-2]. And they're what's called open source and that's a programming term. And that means it is free.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And their server availability is [PERCENT-5] as well. And they don't cost anything and they are [PERCENT-6] customizable.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: And they are just as bulletproof. Now, I mean, at that point, you could sell that to anybody. Hey, free is amazing. You know, that's better than anything that costs even a dollar.
EndUser: So that would be one thing why I'm looking into other ones because there are ones that offer very, very similar options and they don't cost anything ever.
Agent: More.
EndUser: And they're infinitely scalable as well. But I like the reputation that [ORG-2] have.
EndUser: And some of these other ones, while I have found that some of these other ones that don't cost anything, would be better than [ORG-2] in that sense. And their customizability is a lot greater.
EndUser: They don't have the customer service that [ORG-2] does. And I've done all my research and all that stuff. And that I wouldn't mind paying for something that would provide me decent customer service.
EndUser: And if something does go wrong that is not on our end, I know that I have someone that I can call to get that fixed and have it fixed in a timely manner.
Agent: Yeah, because that was a good point because that's definitely something I run into all the time where my clients call or email me and they're like, I'm having an issue with this or that and we can get them in touch with support pretty quickly.
Agent: So that's helpful to know and appreciate your context around how you're making the decision and what factors play into what system you'll end up going with. So that's super helpful.
Agent: When I think about next steps, like I'd be curious, like what would you want to see from [ORG-2]?
Agent: Because typically the typical evaluation path that I go through with potential clients is, we have a call like this where I get a general understanding of what your business is doing, how you guys would be leveraging a [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: And then next, I'll connect you, I'll have a deeper, deeper kind of like introductory call where we really, really dig into some of the different business units you have and functions.
Agent: And then after that, I'll typically pull up and share a custom, I'll make a tailored demo so I would, you know, walk through what the org would look like in your day to day and the different reports you could use in dashboards and how you could work your leads.
Agent: But given that you have a trial org, I guess like what would you, what do you want to see from me to be able to make a decision?
EndUser: I tell you one thing that you can answer that we can, we kind of joke around about and ask questions about what is service console on [ORG-2].
EndUser: What is that supposed to be?
Agent: Um, so I, let me, I'm trying to think of the best way how to put this in the best term.
EndUser: What, what, I mean, you can tell me because I'm a software developer too.
Agent: So.
EndUser: I've got a degree. I mean, we just don't know what that's even used for, really.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, we kind of threw it out because we didn't know what it was for.
Agent: So that's.
Agent: Yeah. So that is the, um, [ORG-2] lightning console app. So that does all of the service needs that you need. So again, it's completely customizable. And then that would be available in.
Agent: Service cloud, which to be completely transparent with you, I'm not super techie or developers. So I probably am botching this explanation.
Agent: But I can get you more resources that kind of like go more in depth on what it does, but essentially that would be where you're doing all your customer service within the app.
EndUser: Okay, sounds good. We just didn't know what it was used for. We kind of looked at it.
EndUser: We looked at the coding in it and we were like, what is this for?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Like, I mean, so we just didn't know.
EndUser: We was like, what in the world?
EndUser: I've never seen something like this. So we kind of joked about it and played with it and was like, I don't know what to do with this.
EndUser: So we kind of, we just removed the option for it on there. It wouldn't get confused with anything else. We were like, I don't know what this is for.
Agent: Yeah, because that's where you could manage your different cases on a single screen.
Agent: So you would be able to see like, the details of the case, but then you would also be able to pull up, like, help articles, and then you would also be able to have the contact details is where there.
Agent: Contact details in that page as well, and then also have the activity history.
Agent: So it would be essentially all the information you would need to manage the case in one place, like, again, but that's customized if that's how you would want to action your different cases.
EndUser: Gotcha.
Agent: And then you would also be able to create, like, your service queue.
Agent: So like you said, if you know that maybe like five people within your company are really, really good at service items, you could create like have that service entry point for cases, but then also have that round robin of like, I want all these cases to go to these people, but then also to like, if this case is related to something very specific that this person typically handles, you can pass it along to them as well.
Agent: So it can do a lot.
EndUser: Gosh, it is.
Agent: That's a question.
Agent: Okay, so with that being said, would you have time, maybe [DATE-14] for us to go through that deeper dive call?
Agent: Like I said, for me to get a better understanding of like how you could be using sales force and what would be important for you in an orange?
EndUser: I mean, you can, but in all reality and honesty, is there what the, I mean, I have no issue doing it.
EndUser: I'm trying to, as much as possible, save your time as well because I mean, I've already got an engineering team on it.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: They're already making it look really good.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I'm liking what I'm seeing. And as we speak, actually, I've got a team of about 13 of them that are working on it, programming it and writing software for it.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So, I mean, is there really any reason to?
EndUser: I mean, because I'm ready to try it out. I mean, I am. I'm ready for this trial to go up. I'll pay for [DATE-21]. I'll see if I like it.
EndUser: You know, and we can go from there. So that's really, I'm just trying to save your time as much as possible. I'll do whatever you feel like you need to.
Agent: No, no, that's perfect.
EndUser: But I'm just trying to save you.
Agent: Yeah, because that was what I'm, I don't think I explained it well, but that's what I meant in terms of like, you already have the org, it's like you're already seeing it.
Agent: So I wasn't sure again, because sometimes I do run into people that don't have the software team that you do. So they just don't know what they don't know.
Agent: So that's why sometimes it can be helpful for me to share that tailored demo, but for you, in your case, like you already have that background, that's what you studied in college.
Agent: So it sounds like you have a really good idea of what you're looking. what your sales force app or its sales force or it looks like. So with the.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And I'm a salesperson too. I get it. I get what I understand. I get it. But that's all I'm just doing at this point. You've got to sell. You know, you've got it.
EndUser: I'm willing to move forward with it. I'm just trying to save as much time with you as possible [DATE-6].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And I mean that in all honesty.
Agent: Okay. Okay. Yeah, well, you're definitely, if you're, you've got the sales skills, you're definitely speaking my language.
Agent: So with that being said, I can give you some pricing, but I'd be curious on what would be your ballpark budget range. [DATE-23] for something like that, because I know you wouldn't want to do [DATE-13].
Agent: It is [DATE-23] over here. So we can definitely get very, very competitive with pricing. So I kind of just again want to get.
Agent: Because I can obviously share with the less price is, but again, would be curious like what you're looking to be paying.
EndUser: I know this game.
EndUser: So what's the best you can do?
Agent: So our pricing is put together on a couple of different things. So like I said, the signature date with it being end of month, [DATE-6]'s or end of month they're making a lot of flexibility.
Agent: And then the other big lever is how many users would be on salesforce. So I know you mentioned the company is 28 people right now.
Agent: Would you be looking to have all 23 of your, employees on salesforce right now, where would you be looking to start with me to like five or 10 out of like your sales and marketing department to get started and then as you scale, deploy it company wide.
EndUser: Well, right now, and right now I'm not planning to have many at all because I'm still, I'm We're going to have to transition.
EndUser: This isn't going to be a just a, oh, you know, a very abrupt, you know, switch over. That would be harmful.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I can't do that.
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: So I'm just looking to see what it would take for even just one person, just me. That way I can train and well, actually I'll have my software engineer train.
EndUser: I mean, because they'll be the ones that actually know where everything is. And because they'll be the ones. that kind of work on that, if whatever the case is, there'll be the ones that know where everything is.
EndUser: There'll be questions even I have for them.
EndUser: So right now I'm still, excuse me, I'm just looking at a transition phase, and that transition phase could take [DATE-23] to do, because we have a lot of people in the system. I have.
EndUser: A little over 13,000 people in the system that we're going to have to manually transfer over.
EndUser: This is not going to be some easy and simple process with that mini because they're stored across, I know, 25 different types of servers and data banks and stuff like that.
Agent: Yeah. Right.
EndUser: So let's start out with one person and I will expand, and I'll expand exponentially. I will, you know, because the first, probably the first thing that I'm going to update is our marketing team.
Agent: Go on.
EndUser: And then I'm going to go from there to our service team and slowly integrate that into each of our teams. I'm going to do it at the speed that my developers can transfer the data over, basically.
EndUser: I just need an active subscription that I can build off of.
Agent: Totally. And when you talk about the growth too, we typically refer to it as here. We'll usually call it crawl, walk, run.
Agent: So like you in that first phase [DATE-21], you're kind of just getting things built out.
Agent: You're making sure you can throw out of the system and then that walk is where okay now we start to bring on [ORG-10], etc.
Agent: And then that run is where you kind of like you said, everyone's using it and everything's working and you start to submit it to other departments.
Agent: So that again is typically how I help my clients get on the platform because like you said, it's not something that you're going to deploy [TIME-4] to all your employees and.
Agent: You have all the data you need to get into. So I think you're definitely on the right track in terms of how you're thinking about it.
Agent: So the other recommendation I would make as well is if you're going to have multiple developers and engineers in the board, I would also get them a license as well so that they can actually build it out.
Agent: Because it's one license per one user. So that way, again, they would be able to log in and make their own features and then you would have. your license to access the information you would need to.
EndUser: For how much is each license.
Agent: Well, that's the other thing too. So if you ended up going with like five licenses versus the one, we would be able to get you [PERCENT-7] discount versus with the one license. It would only be [PERCENT-2] discount.
EndUser: Well, I mean, I'm OK with that because of the fact that they are that as we speak now, they're using my account. And I'm fine with that. I don't. I don't personally use that anyway.
EndUser: That, that, I, when I started the free trial, I gave it to them. I said, y'all do what y'all can with this, you know, that's how I did. I sat down with all of them.
EndUser: I said, here's my login information. Do what you do, what you can with this. Y'all know what I asked for the other ones. Just do the same for this one.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And, uh, I mean, they're not all logged in at the same time. Only one person is going to actually push this [LAW-1] to [ORG-2]. But they're all on a.
EndUser: All of them are on different desktop computers writing the program is [WORK_OF_ART-1] and stuff like that. Those are coding languages, but I mean that they're they're doing that right now.
EndUser: But only one will actually push that that to the To the salesforce platform. So I'm okay with that is fine.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And then from there, I can. I can give them a chance to demonstrate everything, show them where everything is. And when they, you know, companies like family, you got to make sure by taking care of them.
EndUser: At least that's my vision of the business. And I think that's what made me successful that in the Lord God Almighty. So with all that being said, I got to make sure that they're comfortable as well.
EndUser: And when they get comfortable with their.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Then I don't mind starting to add a lot more people to it. And when I say exponentially, I mean like adding 10 or 14 users at a time and adding or 13 more licenses at a time.
Agent: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Well, I can take you through pricing because that's all the information I needed. Like I said, just to be able to have the full scope of what you're looking to do.
Agent: So our list price for one user, again, this is list price, so I'll walk you through the discounts and everything. List price is $[MONEY-1] per user per month.
EndUser: Right. OK. All
Agent: And then if you do five licenses with [PERCENT-7] discount, That would be $[MONEY-2] per user per month.
EndUser: Right. All
EndUser: Right. Oh, I'm scared. Oh.
Agent: And then if you, yeah, with the five, it would be $[MONEY-3] per month.
Agent: What are you talking about?
EndUser: I like that. It's not as good as free, but I guess that's doable.
EndUser: What's the policy on cancellation?
EndUser: I ask this for everybody.
Agent: Yeah, so that's a great question. So we, once the contract is in place, whether that's, you know, [DATE-9], [DATE-25], et cetera, [DATE-21], [DATE-25], we won't be able to make, make contract cancellation.
Agent: However, though, if you guys are using sales cloud, what we can do is make swaps for other products, because I know I've had a lot of clients, like, especially in the mortgage business.
Agent: As things have really shifted, we've definitely become very flexible in how we work with them. So we won't be able, like, you know, I want to be fully transparent with you.
Agent: We won't be able to just cancel your contract, right?
EndUser: Nobody got that annoying [NORP-1] parent refugee watch onto one tile With eagerr cute fairy park happy happy happy happy happy happy
Agent: Like, like, as if it was a [ORG-9]. But there have been cases where we've worked with the contract modifications team and gotten people out of sticky situations. And then like I said, I just have a lot of clients.
Agent: Like I said, you know, as things change and the economy goes up and down, we definitely can be flexible in terms of like swapping spend. So there's definitely ways you can make changes.
Agent: Like, again, if you're using Sales Cloud and you're not really liking it, we can maybe swap that spend over to [WORK_OF_ART-2] or put that money towards using something in service etc.
EndUser: Okay, well, I like that aspect of it. The only really downside is it is a contract. I mean, it's not like I'm just going to, you know, up it and be like, oh, I'm just not paying any.
EndUser: You know, it's just, like I said, something happened one time and I just wouldn't let it happen again, especially with all that money being gone like that.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So yeah, that'll work. That'll be all right.
Agent: So yeah, so I typically, with most clients, I typically have them do a [DATE-25] contract.
EndUser: I can try
Agent: It sounds like this is something that you kind of want to try out a little bit more.
Agent: Would you be then looking to do something along like a [DATE-23] contract then?
EndUser: It.
EndUser: Let's do that and is it free to me twice?
EndUser: Let's do that.
Agent: Sorry, you broke up there.
EndUser: Is there any price fluctuations in that?
EndUser: Like I know that if you sign [DATE-23] contract, then it's cheaper than it would be if you spoke of a [DATE-32] contract, etc.
Agent: Yeah, so it definitely, um, if you did the [DATE-23] contract instead of [DATE-21] contract, I would be able to get you. [PERCENT-8] discount instead of the 43. So we have that option.
Agent: Is that answering your question?
EndUser: Well, what is that?
EndUser: What is, yes, what if I did single user in a... and then built off of that, is there?
Agent: Sorry, I don't follow.
EndUser: But like, OK, sorry about that.
Agent: You're good.
EndUser: So if instead of you said [PERCENT-7] discount, well, if I'm doing [DATE-25], then I mean, excuse me, a single user, then that would, didn't you say it would only be like [PERCENT-2] discount?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Okay, now if I signed the [DATE-23] contract with for a single user or started out at that anyway, would there be any price fluctuation in that?
Agent: Um, you know, with the single user, the best we could do would be that [PERCENT-2].
EndUser: Okay, then we'll stick with the single user and I'll just go with [DATE-9].
Agent: Okay, so sorry, because I know we talked about this a little bit earlier.
Agent: Did you not want to have maybe like three or four or five licenses for the other engineers to be able to leverage the platform?
EndUser: I do not, not at this time because they use my information. Like I said, this is going to be a drawn out process.
EndUser: And I don't want there to be any months that are wasted, if that makes any sense. You know, I don't want there to be something that's not used.
Agent: Yeah, so with the trial, I think they're a little bit less, the compliance is a little bit different, but typically with our licenses, it's only for one user, so only one person is logging in for license.
EndUser: Per
Agent: Sorry?
EndUser: Session.
Agent: No, just in general, no one would, no one is supposed to be like using your license and like, I have my own license and then like your other like marketing people, they would each need one license.
EndUser: Like, oh.
Agent: Like your, the compliance teams will like flag you, you know, you have like five 16 people all logging in and one license. So that's why I would.
EndUser: Oh, yeah, yeah, no, that's fine.
Agent: I
EndUser: Yeah, no, I'm, Yeah, no, there's not going to be 413 or however many people logging into my account.
Agent: Would pick up.
EndUser: There's only one person that's actually pushing that [LAW-1] is what I'm saying.
Agent: Got it. Got it.
EndUser: And I just need to be able to, when it's finished, I just need to be able to demonstrate to, that just show out what works, get everybody comfortable with it, get my development team to do training on it, and then I'll build off of it's life.
Agent: God, I got it, got it. Okay, that all makes sense. Okay, cool.
Agent: So with that being said, you want to do the one license for [DATE-9] with the [PERCENT-2] discount?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Okay, cool. So what I can do as far as next steps, I can send you over a docuSign [DATE-6] and then once that gets completed, I can take the trial.
Agent: Did you want to just change your trial organ to an actual production org then?
Agent: Or did you want to start from scratch?
EndUser: What do you mean?
EndUser: What do you mean?
EndUser: If I still have trial time left, then I'd like to let that run out. And then I'll, if that's okay, because I mean, I felt like I'm still within the timeframe of that.
Agent: Yes, you can definitely do that. The only reason I would suggest moving forward [DATE-6] is because it's [DATE-35]. So the discounting we have is really good versus [DATE-28].
Agent: Like it probably, like it just changes [DATE-32] over month depending on [DATE-35]. So [DATE-28], like the best discount we can get you might only be like [PERCENT-9].
Agent: So it's like again, kind of that [DATE-25], [DATE-25] is kind of like everything's flying off the shelf, like everything must go pricing.
Agent: So that's the only reason I would suggest moving forward [DATE-6], because you would say more money in the long term versus just continuing to use the trial for [DATE-43].
EndUser: I got you. I'm not. It's not the price that is an issue for us. cost is not a problem to me. It's not.
EndUser: The only thing that I was needing that I just didn't have was the of the customer service, you know, and the, and being that they have a sales force has a really good reputation because, you know, I got to add this to my budget and, you know, it's one of those things that I just got to go over with my business strategy team.
EndUser: I've got the pricing of it and I'm sure you'll get, you'll shoot me an email for it so, and as soon as they're, like, as soon as they give me a good thumbs up on it, And I'll let them know that this is what I want to do.
EndUser: Then I'll make the executive decision and we'll move forward with it.
Agent: Perfect. Cool. So I will send you over some information on everything we talked about.
Agent: When do you think you guys will make that decision?
Agent: Because I'm just thinking that's something you guys will talk about maybe [DATE-14]. We can meet at [DATE-41], but wanted to get a better understanding of what your timeline was.
EndUser: Okay, so let me look at this calendar real quick about it. I mean, you would be, and it's something about a business that until you're actually one, it's just something that's hard for people to understand.
EndUser: A lot of times, I don't even know what's going on in my own company. And that makes sense of where to some people, but I have people that control that. Um, You know, I'm really just an owner.
EndUser: I mean, I can make any decision I want to. I can send anybody home I want to.
Agent: One
EndUser: I can hire somebody I want to. I can do all that, but I don't. I have people and most people in the same status, like they just have people that manage that.
Agent: Hand.
EndUser: And they're trying to tell me what to do with my money. I mean, and that's what they're paid to do.
Agent: Third
EndUser: They're paid to make a good Professional decision. So I, I've got to meet with them. I got to see what their thoughts are.
EndUser: And what they think that this company can take on right now and being that it's going to be a star of [DATE-25], that's a good thing because that means our budget restor.
EndUser: So I'll have a lot of extra to play with. So let's see. OK. All right, so get with me on the 4th or 5th of [DATE-38] and [DATE-36]. And I know it's a new year.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But like I said, the pricing is not necessarily what the issue. It's just getting this implemented and getting this set up.
Agent: Perfect. So, um, for next steps, I will go ahead and send you over a calendar invite and we can meet [TIME-5], the fourth. Like I said, I'll also send over the pricing information and breakdown.
Agent: And then if you have any questions too, you can of course pass that information along to your team. And then if you or anyone that has questions for me, I'm happy to answer anything or hop on a call.
EndUser: Okay, sounds good.
EndUser: And just so you get me your contact information, because I mean, who knows, I might go there and they look at their papers and look through their system that they, that the engineering teams made for them and they may give me a thumbs up right on the spot and they say, let's go for it.
EndUser: You know, and I might be calling you right back and say, hey, I got some news for you.
Agent: Perfect.
EndUser: You know, they told me, let's move forward with that. I do know that they're going to want to start with just one license. And I do know that they're going to want to do it [DATE-16].
EndUser: And I'm actually the one making that one, but, you know, they understand the same. Because I mean, what happened to me happened to them. So, so,
EndUser: I may be calling earlier than that. I may call you or shoot you an email or text or whatever. And say, hey, let's move forward with it. I'm ready to swap it over.
EndUser: But I know they're going to want to see what these developers are going to do with this first. I'm kind of curious too.
EndUser: I'm kind of curious to see what all they're going to be able to do with it and what it's going to look like as a finished product.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: So I definitely want to see that before I sign in contracts and I think I'm sure you can understand that. I want to see. But I really like the abilities that self-force has.
EndUser: So just give me your contact information and the pricing and However, I need to go about paying for or signing this and paying for this and we get this set up.
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: And then just to confirm, is your email writer, e-d, at e-d, p-n-c.com?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Perfect. Okay. Yeah. I'll get my information sent over to you there and you'll have my cell phone and my email. And then like I said, the pricing information will be in there as well.
Agent: So whenever you guys are ready to make a decision, you just let me know.
EndUser: Okay, sounds good. All
Agent: Awesome. Well, it was great meeting with you [DATE-6]. I'm excited to... Learn more about the business and support you guys and look forward to connecting again soon.

Agent: Thank you. Have a good new year.
EndUser: You too, thank you.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"The customer expressed several concerns that could potentially prevent the deal from closing:

1. Evaluating other CRM systems: The customer mentioned that they are currently evaluating six or seven different CRM systems, and are looking for the best price and the most features.
2. Customization: The customer mentioned that they liked the customization features of the seller's product and that their engineering team has been able to make some changes and reprogram things to their liking.
3. Server availability: The customer mentioned that they are looking for a CRM system with better server availability, as their current proprietary software has had issues with bugs and server errors in the past.
4. Cost: The customer mentioned that cost is a concern, but it is not the main issue preventing them from making a decision. They are more focused on getting their engineering team to finish customizing the trial version of the seller's product before making a decision.
5. Approval from business strategy team: The customer mentioned that they need to get approval from their business strategy team before making a decision. They plan to meet with the team on the 4th or 5th of the next month to discuss the trial version of the seller's product and make a decision.

They particularly like the customization features of ORG-2 and the reputation it has. However, they have concerns about the server availability and the cost of the product. They are looking for something more bulletproof and customizable, with better server availability. They are also considering how the product fits into their budget and growth plans. Overall, while the customer is interested in ORG-2, they are still evaluating their options and have not yet made a decision.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's availability and the format they prefer for the call (phone or video conference).
2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's company, such as the specific challenges they face and how the customer's role fits into the overall revenue generation process.
3. The sales rep could have asked for more details about the customer's evaluation of other CRMs, such as what specific features or functionalities they are looking for.

6. The sales rep could have asked for more information about the customer's growth plans and how they envision using a CRM to support those plans.
7. The sales rep could have asked for more details about the customer's budget and timeline for making a decision about a CRM.

However, they also mentioned that they have a business strategy team that they need to consult before making a decision. The agreed-upon next steps are to meet on the 4th or 5th of the next month to discuss the decision with their team. The seller also agreed to send over a calendar invite and pricing information.

The customer mentioned that they had removed the option for it in their trial org because they didn't know what it was for. The sales rep could have provided a more clear and concise explanation of the feature and its benefits.
* The sales rep could have also done a better job explaining the flexibility of the pricing and contract options. The customer expressed concern about being locked into a contract and the sales rep could have emphasized the option for a shorter contract term and the possibility of contract modifications in certain situations.
* The sales rep could have also done a better job explaining the benefits of having multiple licenses for the other engineers to leverage the platform. The customer was focused on starting with a single user and the sales rep could have highlighted the advantages of having multiple users, such as the ability to build and test features simultaneously, and the potential for cost savings with a multi-user discount.

Agent: How are you?
EndUser: I'm not bad, how you doing?
Agent: Good long time no talk
EndUser: Yeah, how's everything going?
EndUser: Congratulations on the marriage.
Agent: Hey, I should didn't know if you were gonna remember I forget we talked about it yet got married on the 19nd Now just back in [GPE-1]. [PERSON-1] living the married life [GPE-2].
EndUser: There you go. Alright, well good, man.
Agent: So yeah, it was solid now I'm back in the grind Yeah, man.
EndUser: Did you guys have a good time?
Agent: It was so awesome. Everything went super well. Like, families, just her family is a little bit more broken. So everyone got along, which is amazing and so much fun.
Agent: We were down in [GPE-3], so in [GPE-4], it was a blast.
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: And so, yeah, it was all good. Super positive week, best week of my life.
EndUser: Is that where you guys are from?
Agent: Yep, No, we just really, we found an affordable venue down there that we really love, which is like this [NORP-1] Villa in [GPE-4], so like [TIME-1] off of [GPE-3].
Agent: And so we're like, that's worth the [TIME-2] drive.
EndUser: Yep. For sure, man, that's awesome. Well, good.
Agent: Yeah, what about you?
Agent: How's everything going?
Agent: How's the new business venture going?
EndUser: So far so good. We got irrigation moving. It's going in the right direction.
EndUser: The pools were starting to pick up a little bit now that the spring is hitting.
Agent: Oh yeah, just wait till [DATE-1].
EndUser: So we're doing good there. So yeah, exactly. Yeah, I was hoping to have this all in set by that time frame. But I don't know if it's looking that way.
Agent: What?
Agent: How's that possible?
Agent: I asked them like [DATE-2], everything was gone. He was like, yeah, or [PERCENT-1] done. He just has to do some little tweaks.
EndUser: I haven't seen any of it. Now Pest Fair, which started after us, is already in, I guess, some kind of sandbox situation that they got there.
EndUser: But I haven't seen any, the only thing I've had is like, question and answer, you know, conversations at nauseum.
EndUser: And like I told them last time, like if we keep asking the same question, there's no point in having these calls, if it's going to be the same questions over and over, I just, I can't, I got to see something at some point.
Agent: Yeah, like let's just do over email and then take them off the statement order.
EndUser: Well, and especially now that every time we have one of [TIME-3] long calls, that's going towards our deductions of work time.
Agent: So the last.
EndUser: I'd rather them just work on it and then loop me in at the end.
Agent: Yeah, why don't you just tell them that?
Agent: You're like, hey, guys, instead of spending [TIME-4] in the skull, okay, good.
EndUser: I did. I told [PERSON-2] that. Yeah, yeah, I told [PERSON-2] that [DATE-3], I'm like, there's no point and just rehashing the same information over and over. I said, we need to get some traction.
EndUser: And then that's when they brought up the [ORG-1] thing.
EndUser: So when we had the [ORG-1] call, which I think you were on the [ORG-1] call originally, right?
Agent: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
EndUser: So they told us that the upgrade charge was going to be around 6969.
Agent: Yeah, there was just a change order.
EndUser: Yeah And then I brought up my hesitation with [PERSON-3], like I'm already From my understanding, [PERCENT-2] of the way through of the [ORG-1] information that you guys need.
EndUser: Why would I be charged that much more?
EndUser: You know, and then that's when it was all right. He even said, well, maybe, you know, we can put some of [TIME-5] back towards it, and I know you had chimed in on that as well.
EndUser: And then they send me a change order for 10,000. I'm like, we're going in the wrong direction, and I don't even have any confidence now at this point. that you guys are anywhere close to making this even work.
Agent: Wait, what was the change order for?
EndUser: I'm like, how would you, the change order that we were on the same call, I was waiting on them to give me the actual change order and the request and all the note detail and itemized note detail.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yes, for them to build out CBQ.
EndUser: So that came to me, I think, on [DATE-4], I'll have to go back and look. Anywhere between the. 25th through like the 26rd somewhere in that ballpark.
EndUser: It's [DATE-5] So I'm looking at this and I'm like trying to digest it.
EndUser: I'm like I know I just got off a phone call that said it should be around 8,000, possibly less because we would, you know, we're already so far in this, you know, communication timeline with [PERSON-2] that it might even be, you know, it should be less basically.
Agent: That's... Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And we're going to eliminate some of the phone calls and, you know, these pointless meetings.
Agent: Yep.
EndUser: We're going to eliminate that and just give me something that we have something to work off of. Well, I get the change orange 10 grand. I'm like, okay, something doesn't sit right with me.
EndUser: So I just went through it with Allah [DATE-6] in [PERSON-2].
Agent: One. Okay, good. I was gonna ask for you where they're now.
EndUser: So they added, well, that's the part that's starting to frustrate me now. So I'm going further deeper into like, I gave them my basics of what I wanted the system for.
EndUser: I told them I'm going to take it from a potential prospect, which is my lead zone getting from scorpion. So that prospect now becomes.
EndUser: An internal customer, so we have now the data collection, that goes into a either one or lost lead once it's one.
EndUser: We have an estimate proposal, all of that stuff is done either in the field or it eliminates a lot of our steps because it's already kind of, you know, constructed to where it eliminates some of the flow work that we have to do.
EndUser: And instead of us turning around an estimate in [TIME-6], I'm able to turn around an estimate within [TIME-7].
Agent: Gotcha, exactly.
EndUser: So I'm like, so yeah, so everything's automated at that point.
Agent: A hundred things automated.
EndUser: So then it goes from that now customer into my field. So because you guys are doing the front end in the back end, I then need my back end.
EndUser: So once it's no longer a customer, now it's an actual project, I need my project managers to step in at that point you know, what their budgets are based on what we projected that the cost should be.
EndUser: And if there's any overruns, that needs to be accounted for. And if there's any savings, that also needs to be accounted for because that's where my, you know, project managers get bonus off of.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And he's like, well, I don't know if that's in there.
EndUser: I'm like, it's definitely in there because that was the whole point of us integrating with QuickBooks and I even told everyone from the beginning, my accountant is a codger and he's a pain in the <inaudible>.
EndUser: But we have to do that element because the only way that these projects, if I know they're on pace is if we're either on the proposed budget and if we're up, we're going to do You know from that then something's in the red and something's wrong.
EndUser: We need to identify that and fix it whether it's the sales issue or project issue. And then if the timelines are off.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: So if we're not completing projects on time that will also give us overruns and additional costs that we need to figure out. I said so that's all I need.
EndUser: I said all these other things that we were talking and you asked if I wanted them electronically signed. All the e-signatures. I said yeah I definitely want that stuff but if you're talking That's $[MONEY-1].
EndUser: Then I don't want it. I can print it out and move on. I just at this point want the structure of it working.
EndUser: And then we can go back and add the $[MONEY-1] build out for eSignature and all that. I just want the basics done. But it doesn't sound like the basics are even being accounted for.
EndUser: It's kind of like a little bit in sales and a little bit on the back end, but not the full complete package.
Agent: Gotcha. So yeah, like if in the change order e signs an extra five grand, that's not worth it. Like you could like that, you could probably find someone on Upwork to do for [MONEY-2] or something.
EndUser: Well, and not only that, I already have it where we have e-signature anyway, so I already have a docuSign.
EndUser: So all I have to do is upload it to my docuSign and it cost me what?
EndUser: [MONEY-3]?
EndUser: So I already pay a subscription for it.
Agent: Gotcha. Okay, interesting. So, So moving forward, the thing that we're out of delay on is they sent you a change order for 10,000.
EndUser: Absolutely.
Agent: You already thought the last change order for 8,000 was expensive, but we're okay to eat it as long as this stuff got set up.
Agent: So I'm trying to figure out what like what was added since our conversation on [DATE-7] to now that's making this so much more expensive.
EndUser: They supposedly had to add like... I don't remember if it was [TIME-8] of build out, but I don't see where that build out is coming from because it was all in our original scope.
Agent: Uh-huh.
Agent: What about what did [PERSON-4] say?
Agent: Is that what he said [DATE-6]?
EndUser: No, he didn't really have a good answer.
EndUser: So all he said is he's going to take some of the stuff out, get with [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-2], and I'm like, what's confusing to me, well, I shouldn't say confusing, what's alarming to me is that the change order.
EndUser: Isn't incorporating any of my original scope or any of my original process that I've already paid for and paying for. So it's like we're starting a new project, but it's not a new project.
Agent: Gotcha, like the original build out.
EndUser: It's this is a work in progress. This is like an upsell or whatever it is, you know, to me, I shouldn't be penalized from the very beginning of the project. I'm already I'm already indebted now.
EndUser: Like I've already paid and I'm already in this process.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I shouldn't have to double pay.
Agent: And then let's cut out a lot of these calls like you because because [ORG-2] knows.
EndUser: All of them, I don't need to be on another call until I see something.
Agent: [ORG-2] knows exactly now, right?
Agent: Like there's no there's nothing left for them to ask.
Agent: Is that right?
EndUser: In my opinion, I could be wrong, but in my opinion, I can't answer the same questions over again. In a different way, like.
EndUser: I feel like the meetings are, we're almost trying to find stuff to talk about instead of it being just here.
Agent: And then paying for it.
EndUser: This is what we've done so far.
EndUser: Do you like this part?
EndUser: Like [DATE-8] was the first time [PERSON-2] was like, I'm inputting all of this.
Agent: Yeah. Yes.
EndUser: Does this look right?
EndUser: And yes, it did. It was good. So I'm almost to the point where I wanted to tell them, pick any pool company in the entire country that you guys already do.
EndUser: I'd rather learn their process than continue to try to figure out how to create a process with you.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: And I feel like we've said that a few times now.
EndUser: I'm so open to them and like I said my forms There's more than one way to skin a cat as long as all of that identity is on there How do you know square footage linear footage, you know hole?
Agent: I mean, they have those requirements, right?
EndUser: Digging, that's it. Every pool is going to have that, whether it's in the north, whether it's in the south. All of that is going to be the same.
EndUser: The only difference that I have to worry about is the different county permitting and all that kind of stuff. That would be the only difference.
EndUser: And we can fine tune that portion very easily, which we've already done in calls. I've already given them [PERCENT-3] of that information.
Agent: Gotcha.
EndUser: So I just don't know how to proceed.
Agent: Okay. Like, it feels like to me, they have everything.
EndUser: I feel like I'm running in mud.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And what?
Agent: It feels like to me, they have everything. But they're just used to working like at a slower pace.
Agent: With companies who are very particular about their process, but it's like, no, guys, like, we're okay with learning a new process. We jumped into [ORG-3] so that we could have something better.
Agent: We could have something that helps us move faster, that helps us make more money. Like, we don't need it to be the exact same as our process before. We're okay with learning a new model.
Agent: So, like, you know our requirements, just like build us something and I doubt we'll have any changes, but if we do, they'll be very minute and then we'll pay the change order.
EndUser: Absolutely.
Agent: Versus preemptively making a change order.
EndUser: We're making a change order and I don't have confidence that this change order is the actual understanding of what is necessary.
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And I think Allah also realized that as well because as we were going through like even the forms.
EndUser: So I did you get the [PRODUCT-1] file that I sent with all of like how we figure out proposals and you know, color selections and everything.
Agent: I Um, was this?
EndUser: Don't I don't know if I ended up copying you on that or not, but if not, I'll send it to you.
Agent: No, I don't remember that.
EndUser: It's all kind of drawn out there and like he was saying some of this is redundant information I said I understand that this form works from left to right There's like 10 different you know tabs on an excel file that we use I said the whole point of me switching to you guys is to eliminate Forms like this and having all of my customers at the touch of a couple buttons instead of me having to create files and create different flows for these.
EndUser: This all takes time.
Agent: Exactly.
EndUser: I want it to transition, that's the old point, we're going digital. I want it to transition from sales to production to office, meaning we can do the billings and all the stages are set up.
EndUser: That's the whole point of me explaining this and saving money on it. Internally, not right now.
EndUser: But according to my call [DATE-6], some of what we're doing is gonna have to be, manual, some of it's going to have to be in the system. So it's like, I don't know, I
EndUser: Don't know where we got lost in translation, but something got lost in translation.
Agent: Yeah, was it maybe the change order to make it all automatic would cost X amount of dollars and we said we didn't need that.
EndUser: I'm worried that it's not even from the beginning, from the transition, from [PERSON-5] to team, not not not understanding the flow of how things needed to go or the team that I'm working with isn't understanding how [PERSON-5] translated our necessities.
EndUser: I'm not [PERCENT-4] sure, but I just feel like the original conversations that we've had from the beginning, you and [PERSON-5] and team, that they're no longer, it's fragmented. There's some things that are like hyper.
EndUser: Focused on and they've like nailed and actually created extra elements which are nice, but the whole flow of it I don't feel translated correctly of what I'm trying to accomplish.
Agent: Okay, do you know what is missing or where the flow is missing?
Agent: Because if so, is that all laid out on your document?
EndUser: It's
Agent: You can be like, Hey guys.
EndUser: In a few spots so they're very heavy on the actual like sale intake it's more than i even would have done but i like a lot of what they brought to the table on the sale intake portion
Agent: Oh, well, that's good at least.
EndUser: So, no, I'm not saying that everything's abysmal. I mean, there is some positivity in there. My concern though is the overall project is not the vision.
Agent: But this is just an important piece.
EndUser: So I just don't wanna get a hundred grand down the hole and then I still have the original vision not being accomplished.
Agent: Mm hmm. Exactly.
EndUser: So the some of the pieces that are getting lost is the difference in like a like a one lost prospect versus just a completely lost prospect because I have a feeling you guys have a lot of like, like customers that aren't necessarily extremely high ticket values, but like reoccurring ticket values where this is like a. do or <inaudible> sale.
EndUser: If they did it with us or they did it with somebody else, it's almost a dead lead after that.
EndUser: And there's a lot of lines in between follow-ups that they emphasized on which to a certain extent is really good because we don't do a good job of capturing it once we leave.
Agent: Oh, there's no future with them.
EndUser: So there's some of that that's good. But then the next phase that I think is being lost is between... the sales and then the handing off to project team.
EndUser: The project management portion, I think, is going to be fine because they're going to have all the, you know, the phases of work and all of that will be accounted for.
EndUser: There's going to be checkboxes both for internal and external, whether it's a vendor or a sub. So, you know, that part, I think they have nailed pretty well.
EndUser: But I think the follow up on the actual project itself, meaning, cost a project to overruns additional funding.
Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: I don't, in change order, I don't think that they were ready to capture change orders. We did address that on the call [DATE-6].
EndUser: So I don't think it's gonna be a huge issue, but that was another thing that they weren't even accounting for, because in construction, I mean, I'd say [PERCENT-5] of the projects are gonna have some form of a change order, whether it's a, a chargeable change order or a free change order, but some kind of change is made on [PERCENT-6] of our jobs.
Agent: Yep.
EndUser: Whether it's a color selection difference.
Agent: And if anyone knows change orders should be, should be a spar.
EndUser: Well, that's the thing, and that's where it's kind of like an omission, and it's like those are things that have to be accounted for, because if I say I'm doing blue tile everywhere and the customer changes it to green.
EndUser: Where do I account for that?
EndUser: I don't want to go all of a sudden manual and account for that. That's got to be tracked in that customer's profile. So there's got to be a change order.
EndUser: And whether that tile, maybe let's say it doesn't cost extra money, it still is $[MONEY-4], but it's a change order because the change of scope of work has happened.
EndUser: So I have to have some kind of validation between us and the customer.
Agent: Exactly. And so you want that to be automatic.
EndUser: So that part, I think they're missing.
Agent: How would that be automatic?
EndUser: I mean, I don't necessarily think it has to be automatic, but it has to be some kind of form or some.
Agent: Like there's a process for it.
EndUser: Correct, there's got to be a process or a formula or not formulation a well, yeah, no, it's going to have to have what happens if it has cost to it.
EndUser: Those costs have to be accounted for towards the product and toward or project and then also towards the change order itself. So it's got to be another, another accountability.
EndUser: And like I told them, I'm like, if I have to create another project inside of a project, I said I'd be open to do something like that.
EndUser: I said, but, but a change order is something that has to have some kind of vision and accountability in the project because, you know, [PERCENT-7] of ours is going to happen.
Agent: Mm-hmm. [PERCENT-4], one's going to get a pool and then. [DATE-9] is the same [ORG-4] as [DATE-10]. Like they're going to see pictures. They're going to change things.
EndUser: [PERCENT-8]. And then here's the other thing that happens. We go to order the tiles they picked out and let's say they, you know, we talked to them [DATE-9].
EndUser: Well, they finally committed to us, you know, [DATE-10]. Well, we go to order that tile. Oh, that's a discontinued line. They stopped that [DATE-13]. We don't have enough to do your pool.
EndUser: Ok, so I have to put in a change order. Here's your tile selection now. OK, well, we're going from ceramic to glass. OK, so that glass tile now is $[MONEY-5] more a linear foot.
Agent: Yeah, and that'll change it heavily.
EndUser: Everything. So now I have to have that accounted for.
EndUser: Somewhere in the project, whether it's whether it's a separate job, because that's kind of how we run it now, which I don't like, because it doesn't capture the end result of the full job.
EndUser: I have to manually go in and, you know, do the math, but I was hoping that we could have, and if it can't be done, I'm already doing it now this way, you know, separately as a separate job.
EndUser: But I'd like it to go into the job and incorporate itself that this change order now is, fluctuated the total profitability of this job up [PERCENT-9] or down [PERCENT-9].
Agent: Exactly.
EndUser: Because sometimes we have a change order, we screwed something up and we're eating the cost. So I need to know what happens on that scenario too.
EndUser: So project manager goes out there and forgets to I don't know, forgets to put a seal on something and we get water and an electrical component and it blows it out and now that costs me two grand to replace it.
EndUser: So there's a change order right there and I need to know how that either negatively affects my job or positively impacts my job.
Agent: Man hurts. [PERCENT-4].
Agent: Ah, that is crazy.
Agent: So do they know all of it?
EndUser: I, yes, I'd be very hard pressed that between, like I said, from [DATE-13] that we've talked to [DATE-6],
EndUser: I've said this countless times. Oh. I stopped going on to the [ORG-5] calls because it's the same thing over and over. I just can't do it.
Agent: All
EndUser: Yeah. I just need to see some kind of momentum or action at some point.
Agent: Right, well this is all good stuff.
Agent: So I'm having my, um, feel like [PERSON-6] who listened to this whole call is going to write up a full summary and report so that you don't have to and I'll send it to [PERSON-5] and I'm going to say.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Like, here's everything going on. The path of least resistance is to get [PERSON-7] as cheap as you can go, change order. It's not going to be 10K because it's we.
EndUser: But not at the expense of what I want. So I'm not looking for, I'm not looking for the dollar value meal.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: What I'm looking for is not wasting money on items that aren't, necessary. I need from start to finish. So [PRODUCT-2] is my platform that I'm taking leads in.
EndUser: I need you guys to communicate with [PRODUCT-2], which on the [PRODUCT-2] side I've been absolutely, [PERSON-8] told that you guys are one of their Integration partners and you guys can do it.
EndUser: So I want from [PRODUCT-2] that lead coming in all the way through the end of a construction project that I have everything in between.
Agent: Not me.
EndUser: I need to know did I close the sale?
EndUser: Did I not close the sale?
EndUser: If there was a bad lead, I need to know it was a bad lead.
EndUser: Was it a sales issue?
EndUser: I need to know that stuff, which is everything that we've been talking about.
Agent: Yeah, why?
EndUser: And then I need from when it transitions, I need to have short order either forms or ways for my project manager to look up the quick snapshot information, which they have in their hands, like all the quick snapshot information size of the pool, size of the patio, the color that they're picking for their pool tile, color the picking for their coping, color the picking for their deck, color they're picking for their surface, like those quick snapshots that the project manager can go do a recap with the customer.
EndUser: And say, hey, before we start project, [FAC-1], I wanna make sure that all of these selections are correct, all these sizes are correct.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And the customer says yes, they do a little tiny initial, sign off on it, and I don't have to do it through [ORG-6].
EndUser: They can, I can print it out and have them, physically do it, and I just upload it to their account or profile inside of [ORG-3].
EndUser: If that's a hang up or something that's causing time delays, So we can do that until we get this functioning first, and then we can go back and add this, you know, that program to it.
EndUser: And then once the project is started, I need to know every single touch point of that project.
EndUser: Anytime a bill comes in, I need to make sure it matches up to make sure that bill is accurately accounted for, whether it's above or below our projection.
EndUser: And then any time a phase is completed, I need to make sure that phase is, you know, accounted for.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And then if there's any time there's a inspection that's due in between phases, those need to trigger an action.
EndUser: So in that part of it, I'm pretty sure they have down pretty well because [PERSON-2] and I have been going back on that last couple of weeks.
EndUser: I'm pretty sure most of those things we're going to have to tweak some stuff as we start using it obviously because we're shooting from the hip on some of it, not practical.
EndUser: So that part I'm okay with and then at the very end of the project, anything that had changed, whether it's a positive or a negative change, those need to be accounted for.
EndUser: So at the end of the project, when I say [ORG-7] is completed, I need to know, did I meet my budget, did I meet my plan, did I meet my timeline, and then where, up or down, yes or no, or am I flat?
EndUser: That's it.
Agent: Yep.
EndUser: Is it a red project, a black project?
EndUser: Or is it a project that's still open?
EndUser: That's it.
Agent: It seems simple enough to me. And
Agent: Then did you mention the Quick Book stuff?
EndUser: I mean, it's complicated because there's a lot of stuff on the sales side. but the transition I don't think should be that bad.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And then the production side, like I said, that's pretty easy, that part seems simple to me.
EndUser: The sales process of bidding a project seems like it would be the most complicated, but for some reason I have more confidence that part's being executed than the production side.
Agent: Yes, exactly.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Is that is that everything so far?
Agent: And also I want to know like once the CPU stuff is finished, like will you be up and running or what else is left?
EndUser: No, I think that's it. I think once [ORG-1]'s in, I mean, at that point, it's just implementation.
EndUser: At that point, it's just, you know, my people learning how to navigate through it and then, you know, picking out the stuff that we missed or didn't miss and, you know, whatever's redundant and what we built, you know, that kind of stuff.
Agent: Okay. All right.
Agent: Well, I mean, it's negative right now, but it's positive in the long run that once we get this figured out, like you could have these processes working in [ORG-3] and you don't need to be spending any more money on set up or fixes and you guys can just go.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm more more concerned, a little frustrated. I understand, you know, what, what, what we do on the sales side is a little complicated. But my process is not complicated.
EndUser: Like, so, so if there's another pool company that's already doing take offs or bills, because here's the other thing, quite honestly.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: What is the, what the heck was the name of that company that I was using?
EndUser: Oh my goodness, it's surrounding my tongue. It's, Build.
Agent: Was it a software?
EndUser: Builder trend.
Agent: Oh yeah, builder trend.
EndUser: So builder trend had everything that I needed. I mean, the only part that they didn't have is that it wasn't pool specific.
EndUser: If I had taken the time with builder trend, I could have had that manipulated, and all the templates put in for there, to make it work for what we needed.
Agent: Gotcha. It's almost that simple.
EndUser: It's extremely simple.
Agent: Like what you need.
EndUser: But the complication is in the formulations, like the linear foot conversions and updating the vendor pricing. So the time that I was using builder trend, they could have done all of that for us.
EndUser: I at the time did not have the time to sit and do it because I was opening up two more locations.
Agent: Exactly.
EndUser: So now that we're here and I'm not opening up more locations, you know, now we're doing other things.
EndUser: I find myself not having the time again, but having the resources with you guys to complete what we need to do. So I'm entrusting into you and paying a lot more money to have you guys write it.
EndUser: And that's where if you have another pool company, I told [PERSON-5] when we're at the hockey game, I'm like, take another one of your pool companies. If it costs a little extra, that's fine.
EndUser: My guys will learn how to use it.
Agent: For sure, you can train them. They've learned other products before.
EndUser: They're going to have here's the thing too. My guys are dinosaurs. They're going to have to learn the process anyway. They're going to have to learn [ORG-3] anyway.
EndUser: And that was where some of my hang up was with builder trend. Is that because it was on a tablet and it was more reading and touching friendly and it wasn't just writing enough down and figuring it out.
EndUser: It took them a while for the update. That's always been my biggest concern training my eyes is going to be the hiccup, not the other way around.
Agent: Well, luckily isn't training included in sparse statement or work?
EndUser: Yeah, well, and I'm obviously at this point too, with, you know, I'm [PERCENT-4] committed to going to digital.
EndUser: So, and so are my guys, and they've all admittedly said to, you know, we're going to hang up our dinosaur spikes.
EndUser: And, you know, so everyone's excited for the program and kind of welcoming because we have been growing and You know, with the growth, you know, doing it old school only takes you so much and then it starts, you know, having the wheels wobble.
EndUser: So we need to get digital. We need to streamline things and there everyone is completely open. It's just going to take a little bit for them to understand and use it.
Agent: Exactly. And they'll get there, especially if they like the eye to <inaudible>, like most of the stuff will translate to an [ORG-8] through the [ORG-3] mobile app.
EndUser: So.
EndUser: Yes, and that's where, again, I think most of what we need to accomplish can be accomplished both on phone, [ORG-8], or computer, which these guys would rather do phone or [ORG-8] than a computer.
EndUser: So, any of the back behind the scenes stuff, we've already kind of addressed and my office staff will take care of any of that.
Agent: Okay, I like that. So next steps, I'm getting this to [PERSON-5]. We're going to get we need an updated change order from them on what's going on.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: We're taking off [TIME-9] of calls. If you want to run something by me, just shoot me a ping. It takes [TIME-10]. We don't need to get [TIME-4] long call.
Agent: Let's make sure there's change orders included in your quoting process. I am going to try my best to get you that same pricing that. I showed you for [ORG-1] on [DATE-10] of our [DATE-18].
Agent: Usually we can't, but pricing hasn't gone up, so I don't see why I couldn't. Usually for my team members, it's more of a sales tactic, but I'm close to my VP.
Agent: So I'd be very surprised if I wasn't able to just [PERSON-9] out your discounting again. And then other than that, I think that's it.
Agent: I think the next big step is we just need to get that change order agreed upon and say, look, You now know what I want and you now have the transcript from this call.
Agent: Um, like, let's just do it.
EndUser: Right.
EndUser: And i had a similar call with all of us too so between the two phone calls hopefully it it it makes sense and we can get what work ultimately looking for accomplished Mm hmm.
Agent: Well, hey, that sounds good to me.
Agent: Why don't we, um, I know you're like the busiest man in [GPE-5] right now, but we should we're due for like a catch up lunch beers dinner happy hour something maybe we do that in [DATE-14]
EndUser: You call it man you let me know Alright, you call it let me know and I owe you one two for a little congratulations for your marriage.
Agent: No, I think honestly I think sales force owes us both for this one so So we'll be on sales force for sure yeah, exactly But yeah, keep me posted.
EndUser: Yeah, no kidding.
EndUser: Ready to go back to the hockey game, right?
EndUser: And you...
Agent: You got my you got me on flag text email. I want to make sure this all goes well because this is going to be awesome when it's all rough and running.
EndUser: I know I have confidence. I'm not like I said, I'm a little frustrated. I'm not mad. I'm just frustrated and and concerned, you know, more than anything.
Agent: And then you're totally in the right feeling like that. Like you've been paying all this money and you're not seeing it working yet.
EndUser: But.
Agent: So it makes sense.
EndUser: Well, it's not even the working part. I'm just I'm concerned that my vision of what we need isn't. I'm going to have a sales heavy. form, which is good, but I'm not going to have the full integration.
EndUser: That's my concern. Because I want both sides, left and right side, accounted for in this.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And that's the old point where I'd said, you know what, just take it all. Because here's the thing, if you can prove it out on my side, the whole, what is it, customers on [ORG-9] will convert over to.
EndUser: So that's what, you know, I was the guinea pig of this whole process.
Agent: Yep. Hi now.
EndUser: So I had him pull the trigger on [GPE-6] sooner than he wanted to just because of, you know, armamento.
Agent: Exactly. Yeah, like you, yeah, like it would have made more sense to like you wanted this more, but [ORG-10] needed it more.
EndUser: So
EndUser: Correct, absolutely. Yeah, that's exactly it.
Agent: Well, it's good that they're like [PERCENT-7] set up.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, no, there, I mean, that's, that's what's pissing me off is that they're farther along than I am.
Agent: Then you won't have to deal with that anymore.
Agent: Yeah, and you're the one who's like handling all this.
EndUser: Yeah, well, I stopped taking the calls for the PESBAR side. I just thought, I'm like, I can't be a part of the same. You guys answer all the questions.
EndUser: Tap me in when it's time for something that needs to be accomplished.
Agent: Exactly.
Agent: Oh my God, I came and master in running a business and then also helping another company with their sales for supplementation.
EndUser: Yeah. I mean, it's OK. The guys are all pleasant. I just think. It's the waste of my time.
Agent: Yeah, because I mean, you don't have equity in [GPE-7], do you?
Agent: Just a construction?
EndUser: No, just all the pool stuff, yeah.
Agent: Oh, I wouldn't be joining a single call.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Well, actually I would because if it all goes sideways, you might be blamed.
EndUser: No, I know.
EndUser: Well, that's why I bailed out right away. I'm like, man, my <inaudible>'s not going well right now. So you, [PERSON-10], you're on your own, buddy. No, I wouldn't do that.
Agent: Yeah, sorry. Good luck. Now this will all be awesome. I'm excited.
EndUser: Yeah, no, sounds good, man.
Agent: I'm excited. All right.
EndUser: Well, I appreciate it. I know you're probably busy doing personal stuff, but I appreciate you taking the call.
Agent: For sure, man, I want to make sure this all goes well.
Agent: The last thing I want is for you to buy something and then it's causing frustrations because I've seen far more complicated implementations get done and about the same timeframe.
Agent: And just hoping we can do it without more change orders. I just don't see why there would need to be more change orders after this one. That shouldn't be 10K. So that's the next step.
Agent: And I'll keep you posted on what [PERSON-5] says.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: You let me know if you have mum too.
EndUser: Yeah, just let me know. And like I even told [PERSON-5], if I feel like
EndUser: Everything is accounted for and it's a justifiable change order, I'm not opposed to it. I'm not going to agree though to $[MONEY-6] change order for [TIME-9] that I can't see that there should be [TIME-9].
Agent: For sure.
EndUser: And we're not talking the same language as far as the end product. So that's the recap of the conversation.
Agent: All right,
Agent: I like that.
EndUser: So, all right, bud.
Agent: I will get this all to him.
EndUser: We'll enjoy. I will do it.
EndUser: So are you falling Backup with me or are they falling up with me, I guess, in [DATE-13]?
Agent: Yeah, I should have. Yeah, I'm going to send this over.
EndUser: And they're not stopping production on doing stuff obviously, right?
EndUser: Because we're moving forward. So we just need to agree upon it.
Agent: Yeah, sounds like it.
EndUser: Okay, because that's kind of what I get from [PERSON-2] too, is that they're moving forward with it. They just need the green light to show me, I guess.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, no, I don't think they stopped anything.
EndUser: Okay, good. I
Agent: Yeah, they want to finish this out too. They don't like having like their utilization drag on like that if it goes longer than expected. So yeah, they want to get this goal for you two know.
EndUser: Was going to say I can't imagine this is helpful for anybody.
Agent: Yeah, that yeah, we're everyone's on the same page here.
EndUser: Okay. All right, sounds good. And if I'm being unreasonable too, you can always tell me and step in and say, hey, look, that's not how it works.
Agent: Simple I know no, I don't think you are because if I was in your shoes and I was right where you are It'd be like thing, you know feel like we talked about it this the beginning or are there chain gorders yada yada I mean I get why there might be a change order, but like at least you know Just build me something simple and I'll take a look So.
EndUser: Or yeah, or just give me what you guys already have built. And I will learn it. I mean, that's, you know, that's even easier for you guys.
Agent: Yeah
EndUser: You make money twice on something you've already done. Tweak it and give it to me.
Agent: Well, the fun thing about the way [ORG-3] is built is that it's ultimate privacy, so they can't technically copy and paste a build from another org.
EndUser: I, yeah, I totally understand that. Yeah.
Agent: Which sucks because you know how much time would be saved?
Agent: Well, and then, like, let's say,
EndUser: But they can use people who've been on other teams.
Agent: Yeah, exactly. But imagine if we could just take, like, if test bear could just take. like TerminX is [ORG-3] build out all the Code everything and just copy and paste it.
Agent: But then, you know, how you get sued by TerminX.
EndUser: But that's why those guys do that stuff internally. So they'll buy sales for people and bring an internal.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: Yeah, because then they have like a beast of a product that does everything they want.
EndUser: Yeah. And then they can sell that product back to other companies or pieces of the product back to other companies. Hey, we've already figured that coding out or here it is.
Agent: Yeah, that's what [PERSON-9]'s construction did. These two farmers that started [PERSON-10] are now multimillionaires because they built out a sales force process.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, just from what they figured out. Yeah.
Agent: That's crazy. Let's do that with like full construction.
EndUser: Hey, if we can get this right, I absolutely would be open to that [PERCENT-4].
Agent: And How would be I mean that's a great idea because it would work with other companies too.
EndUser: Every single company needs it because I can guarantee you. And unless if they're one of like a [PERSON-13]'s pool, which is that, you know, five or six states and they do probably, you know, 66 mill.
EndUser: They might have an internal program, but I guarantee you every other company that's between that one two five mill, they don't have a program at all. They're doing everything through [PRODUCT-1] like I'm doing.
Agent: That is crazy. They're not going to be able to withstand like the future.
EndUser: I They can't grow. You just can't, you can't have that grow.
Agent: Mean, yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, you get to a point or either keep hiring people who can help you manage the Excel for $[MONEY-7] a year or you simply like automate stuff.
EndUser: Yeah, but it's like pulling a wagon with small wheels. It, you can only pull it so fast before it starts getting unstable and flips over. And that's why these guys, they've tried it and gotten bigger than they were.
EndUser: And then they started losing money and they're like, I'm twice as size. So I'm cutting back and they cut all that out and get back down to, you know, that million and a half, two million range.
EndUser: And they realized I'm making more money than I am when I was making five.
Agent: Oh my god, that's crazy. They need so much help. They have so many employees now.
EndUser: And it's so much help and then people start stealing and then they lose touch of, you know, how things look.
Agent: Jeez.
EndUser: So yeah, it's because there's a lot of high-end products.
Agent: That's why we need processes. And that's why we need automation.
EndUser: I think an automation system's [MONEY-8]. Someone takes one of those and you can't eat that on a [DATE-14] basis.
Agent: No chance. Yeah, or even just like filters that you could have your [GPE-8].
EndUser: Yeah, I've [MONEY-9], [MONEY-10], [MONEY-9] here and there and you start eating that up and you know, you you your inventory guy isn't you know, keeping the correct inventory by the time you catch it.
EndUser: You know, you spent [DATE-14] in equipment that's unaccounted for.
Agent: Man, that's insane.
EndUser: I'm sure that's what you hear if you deal with AC guys, I'm sure that's what you hear from them too.
Agent: That's the beautiful thing about AI. Oh my God, yeah. That's why it's a beautiful thing to have AI within the ERP system and everything is tracked because [ORG-9] won't lie to you.
EndUser: Yeah, so.
EndUser: That's right. Yep.
Agent: Unless you train it too.
EndUser: So I was going to say unless the computer inputs are wrong, right?
EndUser: So all right, bud.
Agent: We'll get into that down the road, don't worry.
EndUser: Well, let's get this finalized. I want to get this moving. So let me know whatever I need to do next. And I appreciate the help.
Agent: Yeah, appreciate you. Thanks for keeping me in the loop here.
EndUser: What's that?
Agent: Thanks for keeping me in the loop here.
EndUser: Yeah, no worries, man. I appreciate you jumping in. All right.
Agent: For sure. All right, we'll talk soon. Have a good rest of your night.
EndUser: Have a good night. [PERSON-13].
Agent: See you, bye.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was a mix of frustration and concern. They expressed frustration with the lack of progress and understanding of their vision for the project. They were also concerned about the increasing costs and the potential for wasting money on unnecessary features. However, they also expressed a desire to move forward with the project and a willingness to work with the seller to find a solution. Overall, the customer seemed open to continuing the conversation and finding a way to make the deal work, but they were clearly expressing their dissatisfaction with the current state of the project.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the correct decision maker was on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no clear agreed-upon next steps mentioned in the conversation.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer expressed concern about the high cost of the upgrade charge for the seller's product, which they believed to be around 6969, but later received a change order for 10,000.

voice_17333_167_0LQ3y000008WcHIGA0,"EndUser: And insurance services, we will be with you shortly. Thank you for calling [ORG-1]. This is [PERSON-1].
EndUser: How can I help you?
Agent: [PERSON-1], just the person I wanted to speak to, this is [PERSON-2].
EndUser: Hey, [PERSON-2], how's it going?
Agent: Listen, I'm good. I hope you had a pleasant weekend and stay dry.
EndUser: Nope.
Agent: Ok. No.
EndUser: No, because I got that email on [DATE-1].
Agent: I don't know if you know
EndUser: That she finally got everything exported in or imported, I'm sorry.
Agent: What I'm going to do,
EndUser: And that was actually the file. But you're, hang on [TIME-1]. Hang on. I'm going to put you on hold for just a second.
Agent: Can I ask it out?
EndUser: Can you hear me?
Agent: Go ahead.
EndUser: I just didn't want to hold the hand hand. Hang on [TIME-2].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Sorry. So. I did find a glitch in file maker that caused a lot of the people in ending up in the wrong campaign, and I wouldn't have known these are old events that we had in file maker.
EndUser: So I would have never known.
Agent: Okay. Right.
EndUser: So that I can understand, but [PERSON-3] telling me as of [DATE-2] at 3-something in the afternoon that everything was finally exported over, that's kind of an issue. I mean, I gave her everything. [DATE-3].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And she just now finished everything, the exportation.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And then I did some spot checking because I'm trying to do some clean up. And just if I went to what's called [ORG-2] 1018-18, it was an event we had [DATE-4].
EndUser: And I think you were not that one yet.
Agent: I was at that. Right.
EndUser: And just spot checking that one. of campaigns, there was a person missing that was in file maker but not in a sales force.
Agent: Okay, and listen.
EndUser: And this person we should be contacting for [DATE-5], we should have been contacting them. We didn't because we stopped using sales for our file maker [DATE-6].
Agent: Okay, right.
EndUser: So that concerns me that not everybody got transported over.
Agent: Yeah, I see, I do see.
EndUser: And should have.
EndUser: So yeah,
Agent: I opened up the spreadsheet so I could follow along. This is I think just her nose of what she made.
EndUser: And, the red ink is my notes.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: If you look at the spreadsheet that I print I sent over [DATE-7], there's duplicates in there. There are some that aren't even in [ORG-3] that were in [PRODUCT-1]. This was as of [DATE-8].
EndUser: I emailed her [DATE-9] because I was in the office and I said, hey [PERSON-3], I'm here in the office so we can go over problems and she hadn't even looked at it yet.
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And then she gets back to me on [DATE-1] when I'm not in the office on [DATE-1].
Agent: Yes,
EndUser: I take [DATE-10], you know, to do my other job.
Agent: Right. Right.
EndUser: I'm a seamstress when I'm not here.
Agent: Yeah, seems to, aren't you, aren't you a notary as well?
Agent: I might have been.
EndUser: I'm a notary as well.
Agent: Yeah, I'm.
EndUser: So in between all of this, I'm doing notary work. So I'm trying to do this, but you know, it's not complete.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And she keeps saying, yeah, completion date by [DATE-8]. Well, just me spot checking, I've already found one person missing from sale, from [ORG-3], notes for one of our client has even come over and I know it should have.
EndUser: And people are in the wrong campaigns and that's not all on me. Some of it, yeah, because my file maker glitch. Absolutely, you know.
EndUser: I just found out the file maker switched and put people into different events, which is really freaking annoying.
Agent: Okay. Yeah. Hopefully
EndUser: But, you know. Yes.
Agent: There's a which is, you know, what's just worth moving forward. I'm looking at one of these. these campaign lists that also [PERSON-3] sent over. There is, it is via [ORG-4]. I'm not sure.
Agent: Ok. OK. Oh, so that's what you printed out, and then made the corrections well in the red.
EndUser: I printed out.
EndUser: Yeah, that printout is mine like there's duplicates in here. There's a couple duplicates.
EndUser: Most numbers for current like more current events like [DATE-12] and up are like one or two off. That happens. Get that. Okay. You know, sometimes the hiccup happens.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: But the hiccup I found was like for if you look at the spreadsheet, [WORK_OF_ART-1], and I think I found out what happened with there.
EndUser: There was a glitch in [PRODUCT-1] that I would have never known about because that is one of our old like 2184. events.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: So we never go on that one.
Agent: Right. And there's a There's like 24 or so missing.
EndUser: So that was a [ORG-5] on R. There was 18 missing and I figured out what it was from.
Agent: [PERSON-4]. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah.
EndUser: It's a glitch on [WORK_OF_ART-2], I wouldn't have known [PERSON-3] wouldn't have known.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Get that absolutely, absolutely understand, you know.
Agent: Okay. Understood.
EndUser: Some of these old events I'm finding hiccups and I'm like, well, some of them now I have to go into salesforce and clean it up. That's fine.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I can do that. But they're, you know, just doing a quick spot check, somebody that I know I sent over, say, for instance, it was from a Fia Rellos 102504.
EndUser: I looked that person up, sorry, I looked that campaign up in [PRODUCT-1], and they had one more person than [ORG-3] had.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And so I looked up the person, that person's not even in [ORG-3] at all, but they're in [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Got it. I know. I noticed, at least in [PERSON-3]'s notes in the updated [PRODUCT-2], she updated them 3-3.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: I think she added that the data sheet provided only 18 contacts. So, yeah, and I believe that's what the description to see is.
EndUser: Yeah. And it was 18.
EndUser: So there's some people that never have made it over, but should have.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And that concerns me a lot because like this person that was missing from [ORG-3], we should have contacted them in [DATE-17].
Agent: Yeah, do you think it had to do with the way that data sheet exported some of this information?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I don't know because I did exactly what [ORG-6] told me to do.
EndUser: I had [PERSON-5] in the office with me when we did it and I had either [PERSON-3] or [PERSON-6], and I don't remember because it's been [DATE-13], show me exactly what they wanted me to do.
EndUser: Like I shared my screen and I was like, okay, how do I do this?
EndUser: Do I do it right?
EndUser: So I do it exactly right, you know what I mean?
EndUser: And they said do it this way.
Agent: Got it. Yeah, of course.
EndUser: And I did a couple of test runs and it did, they said everything was right.
EndUser: So [DATE-17], that [DATE-19] because it was [PERSON-7] King Junior weekend, I spent the entire time in this office exporting.
Agent: Mm hmm. One. Right.
EndUser: Making that file, exporting, making that file. We had 186 events that I exported over. And then I emailed them over to [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-8] and said, here it is.
EndUser: And I kept asking [PERSON-3] throughout the whole process is everything exporting properly?
EndUser: Is everything going over?
EndUser: Is there any concerns?
EndUser: Because I'm sitting right here at my desk. So if there's any problems we can get on a call we can maybe fix the problem. And I'm willing to do that.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: And I was here [TIME-3] that whole entire weekend, exporting everything over, making sure the concentrate focus, like I locked myself in here, turned my cell phone off, which is layer, to focus.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Doing the data. Right. Yeah.
EndUser: And she told me during that whole process, yeah, everything's fine. And now we are on [DATE-18]. And it's not.
EndUser: And I have [PERSON-9] literally going, well, if you don't have it done right, we're going to take you off the project. And I'm like, wait [TIME-4]. I've done everything I'm supposed to do.
EndUser: I exported properly to my knowledge.
Agent: Right, right.
EndUser: I'm not an IT person, but I did exactly what [ORG-6] told me to do.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: They should have had everything ported over. And then, had I known there was [DATE-18], I could have been on this. Now, you know, I find out [DATE-18]. And you
Agent: Right. Right. And these 137 campaigns, these were all different events that you at to experiment and perhaps grow their eggs.
EndUser: Know, exactly. And I put the title on, and I even have the database export file that I made, because I made a file.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: For each one of those, and I said, okay, make sure that one gets over, make sure that one gets over, and get that one over.
EndUser: And I titled them the exact event name that I had in [PRODUCT-1], I just didn't put dashes in.
Agent: Right, right.
EndUser: Like, I'm looking at [PERSON-10]. When I exported it over, I called it [PERSON-10], no dashes.
Agent: All right.
EndUser: So I could do a comparison. And I just went in there, and I looked. Say for this one, we get to the beginning of this one. Let me do a fine, sorry, hang on [TIME-1].
EndUser: And I know file maker is an antiquated system. Boy, how do you do one. You know, it's old, but so I'm doing a compare list right now.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: I've got my sales force and my file maker open.
Agent: And then do you still have those data sheets to him?
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Okay. I don't know.
EndUser: Yep. Sure do. I kept it over.
Agent: It
EndUser: So I'm looking at that and it's 18 numbers. So that one matches. Hurray, [ORG-7].
Agent: Goes out.
EndUser: But I'm literally having a spot check and I'm doing ones from everything from [DATE-24] until current.
Agent: Right, right, of course.
EndUser: Because, you know, I've got to make sure all of my, and my concern is I have missing active clients.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: I have clients that are going to be missing. That means she hasn't met the mark. I am she did not meet the mark.
EndUser: And why is it taking this long to meet the mark?
Agent: On the client side.
EndUser: On the [PRODUCT-3] side, yeah.
Agent: Well, did I know all these campaigns?
Agent: There's some discrepancy, you know, we wanted to call it.
Agent: Are all of you calling?
EndUser: And [PERSON-1], is she fine?
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Are all the clients listening?
EndUser: That's what I'm saying. Say if you're getting to our file maker and you type in [GPE-1] 10-7, let me type this one in, hang on a second, sorry.
Agent: No.
EndUser: 10-24-6.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Or what about just in terms of your active clients?
Agent: Are they currently with [ORG-3]?
EndUser: No. That's what I'm saying. There's one myth. I've come across at least one if not more. I'm still spot checking.
EndUser: I'm literally spending my entire day spot checking, which is going to be a big, huge issue from I'm literally staying the night here, basically to go through all this because I'm being hounded by [PERSON-9] to fix the problem.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And I thought we were, you know, on track to fix the problem and we're not.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And it's [DATE-18] before [PERSON-9] is like going, you've got to fix this. So like I just typed in 171807, which is a [ORG-8] event that we had in [DATE-18].
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: [ORG-3] says I have 18 people in that. My file maker says I have 18.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And I did a comparison list of names. Like I looked at, you know, who was and who was and where is where.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: That's fine. And I can always say one person did not make it over from filemaker over to the workforce. Because it's a small enough list.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I can scan through that and it was a yauge-wing who we should have been contacting. since [DATE-6] and we didn't know because we stopped using file maker.
Agent: Okay, got it.
EndUser: So you have missed an opportunity.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Another one is some notes having transferred over. We have a [PERSON-8] who is one of our active clients for quite some time now.
Agent: The
EndUser: His name transferred over but his notes never made it from file maker.
Agent: Note with the filmmaker. Okay.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: [PERSON-12] should have been in [GPE-1] 18 and he's in 24. We're not sure how that happens. You know. And now.
Agent: Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking at some of the seminar audits that was provided in the spreadsheet. Okay.
Agent: And then, aside from the campaigns, what else on the roadmap hasn't come through yet?
Agent: I'm curious with your existing client information.
Agent: You know, being able to actually use a [PRODUCT-3], I'm just, I'm trying to wrap my head around, you know, what else in this scope?
EndUser: I mean, we're able to use it.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: We can look up clients. The problem is my concern is some of these clients didn't transfer over.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And how are we supposed to know?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I mean, we have thousands of clients, you know what I mean?
Agent: Right, of course.
EndUser: So how am I literally going to have to take time out of [DATE-18] to try to match up and make sure every client made it over?
EndUser: And that's going to take [QUANTITY-1] of work. And I had a no list with the problem I would have started [DATE-18].
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: You know, but [PERSON-3] told me when I exported everything over, yeah, everything's going well, everything's fine, everything's transferred over.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And now she's telling me, yeah, I finished [DATE-24], on a [DATE-1] when I'm not here to double check things.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So now I have got to spend my entire [DATE-18]. And I've also got a new staff member trying to start [DATE-20], so I've got to set up his office still.
EndUser: I also have another staff member's computer is crashing, so I'm trying to fix that.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You know what I mean?
EndUser: So I should have been able to go hear the information if there's a problem, let me know.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Okay. Yeah. Mm hmm.
EndUser: Instead, I said, here's the information, I got a thumbs up saying, yeah, everything went, and then I'm finding out, oh, but it didn't. You know, she just finished downloading from what I'm looking at in [ORG-3].
EndUser: She just entered 163 contacts in [DATE-18].
EndUser: Well, why was the 165 contacts brought over in [DATE-6]?
EndUser: When it, you know, should have been in there. When I did that early export on [DATE-35].
Agent: Right, right.
EndUser: Why has it taken her until [DATE-26] to tell me everything was completed?
Agent: Okay. Yeah.
EndUser: It shouldn't have taken that long. Now, again, [PRODUCT-1] had a <inaudible> up. I absolutely get that where the events and the campaigns aren't quite lining up.
EndUser: Some of these campaigns are older than God, so we're probably not going to see those clients anyways.
EndUser: I get that, but what concerns me is, I'm just doing quick spot checks and I'm finding people already missing or notes not datted over or dates messed up.
EndUser: So it's like, <inaudible>, what happened?
Agent: Yeah, I know there are always and I know these data transfers are not always seen this due to you know like data cleanliness.
EndUser: You know?
EndUser: You
EndUser: Right.
Agent: So, yeah, it can be a bit of a. It's you've done the thing.
EndUser: But she should inform me that I should have been informed, hey, we're still going to be missing a lot of stuff.
Agent: I think having to project them in. Yeah.
EndUser: I'm getting to it. But now I literally have until [DATE-8] to clean it all up.
Agent: Yeah, I think, yeah.
EndUser: I have [DATE-18].
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: I'm not trying to be a <inaudible> or anything part of my [NORP-1], but [PERSON-9] is coming down hard on me because he's like I thought everything was fine.
Agent: No, of course, of course.
EndUser: I've got so to <inaudible>. Because [PERSON-3] said everything's fine when it wasn't.
Agent: Right, right. Yeah, I know it seems like for my understanding or for what I understand is that the red sheets or at least any information that she had been transferred over.
Agent: But then of course I think in the export, you know, things might have fallen to the cracks. And so that cleanliness wasn't there. And so she might have just completed what was given to her.
Agent: But then of course there wasn't. a full accurate set or again things fell through the crack. So it happens. Is there anything, [PERSON-1], I know there's a lot right now.
Agent: Is there anything that you think I can Support or help with?
Agent: Because I would love to meet you.
EndUser: I don't know. I don't know. I'm, like I said, I'm very frustrated.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: I feel like...
EndUser: And for this to all be complete like [PERSON-3] keeps going, yeah, the completion on the fifth is no problem.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: I need to make sure everything that I exported over is in our file maker. And from what I'm seeing, it's not.
Agent: Yeah. Okay.
EndUser: And then the next step is all those contacts that I exported over into the [PRODUCT-3] side should have been exported into the Account Engagement side and it's not so far.
Agent: Right.
Agent: Uh huh.
EndUser: A lot of it is, but we're still seeing a lot of it's not.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And like I said, [PERSON-9] literally came down [WORK_OF_ART-3] on me going, it's got to be done or else.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Okay, I guess that'll help. And like I said, I thought everything was fine. And then [DATE-34], like two two [DATE-35] at most, I'm starting to see, oh, it's not.
Agent: Couple of discrepancies, yeah.
EndUser: There's some major discrepancies. And now it's like a whole <inaudible>. I'm scrambling, and I'm still scrambling, and I'm still scrambling.
EndUser: And [PERSON-3] just gets back to me on the third of stuff on a [DATE-1] with knowing that I had a deadline.
Agent: [DATE-20].
EndUser: I was here [DATE-18]. I actually came in on [DATE-9] and I emailed her in the morning. I think I cc'd you on that saying I'm here in the office. Let's do this.
EndUser: Is there any problems?
EndUser: Is there any issues?
EndUser: Oh, I haven't gone through it yet.
EndUser: What?
EndUser: Well, I got a tour, okay, on [DATE-8] at [TIME-5], 2-3 in the afternoon.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Fine. They're on [GPE-2]. I get it. That was on [DATE-8]. But knowing that we had a deadline, that should have been like number one thing that she looked at. [DATE-9] [TIME-6].
Agent: No, understood.
EndUser: Because, you know, I have a deadline now.
EndUser: And then she reaches out [DATE-1] at, and it was like [DATE-1] [TIME-7], you know?
Agent: Right. Right. And now there was.
EndUser: I'm like, I can't do anything [DATE-1] [TIME-7].
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You know?
Agent: That's the one day you take off.
EndUser: I was literally working on a project that I had to finish [TIME-8].
Agent: Right.
EndUser: For my seamstress job. So I looked up that email and you're kidding me. You're kidding me.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You're now reaching out to me?
Agent: I know, I know it's frustrating and especially with the clock that was given and the deadline and the expectation. So I understand I can be frustrated there. Yeah.
EndUser: Well, I need, I have to go back to [PERSON-9] who is like going on, what's going on, and tell him, I don't know.
EndUser: So I don't know if maybe you can. Send an email letting him know that I talk to you and that you understand the discrepancy.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Because the phone calling is going to do <inaudible> and me telling him it's going to do <inaudible>.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: No offense.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You've seen [PERSON-9]' emails. I'm just saying.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You've met the man.
Agent: Of course, I know him, him, my manager, [PERSON-17] and [PERSON-13], I believe have a call on [DATE-35] to kind of discuss everything.
EndUser: Yeah. I see it on his calendar.
Agent: I know [DATE-8] there's still the call with [ORG-6] to kind of walk through at least what has been completed. Definitely will be. a space to address these discrepancies here.
Agent: We want to ensure that, you know, the most valuable and important data has been transferred over, such as your existing clients. And we can confirm that either in [DATE-37]'s, like, [TIME-9] or [DATE-8]'s call with them too.
Agent: But, yeah.
EndUser: I'm trying to, but there's a lot of stuff I have to go through.
Agent: Right, right.
EndUser: Literally, I'm staying pretty much the night here. So I've already got my hotel booked for [TIME-10]. I'm not even going to be able to go home. Because there's no way.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Because I need to make sure everything is done.
EndUser: And I haven't replied to [PERSON-3]'s email because I'm like, what am I going to say to her?
EndUser: No, you're not done. You know.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, fair enough.
EndUser: I don't want to come across a <inaudible>. I really don't. I'm really trying to understand.
Agent: No, no. And you're coming from the right place.
EndUser: But
Agent: So, yeah, there are a lot of different things.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm very frustrated. And I get that campaigns and events aren't matching up. I get that that's a cleanup thing. And it looks like maybe good chunk of our clients have been exported in.
EndUser: But like I said, I just did a spot check.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And I'm seeing so far, no, that's not the case. So now I'm going to go through every event from [DATE-24] to now.
Agent: Right, I would, yeah, the events I understand are going to be very time consuming and you know you want to ensure that all the attendees have made it over.
Agent: I would also, in terms of like a list of hierarchy, I think client information too would be very more important. And so, and more crucial.
EndUser: Well, their names are follow-up days. which I've told her to be an important thing because that's how we work calls.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And you know, it's like, well, I'm not able to do her calls, you know, because. So I'm literally, and my concern is what happens to like the events from [DATE-18] before the world crash down.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Did everybody get over from there?
EndUser: How about since before?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: We have active clients from going way back.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Did they all make it over?
Agent: Yeah. I know it's a lot of data and a lot of. Right.
EndUser: It's a lot of data and had I known this was a problem back in [DATE-6] when I asked her the first time, I would have started going through.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: But I didn't have this information until [DATE-18].
Agent: Yeah. And I'm curious too, [PERSON-1], when did you realize that there was a potential glitch with, you know, yeah.
EndUser: Filemaker [DATE-37].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But I still got those titles went over. They just are wrong spot.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And that's fine.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I am not holding her up. That's in what's funny is file maker I would have never known.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Because if you look at the first one on that spreadsheet, bold night, that's something that we did in [DATE-45].
Agent: Right.
EndUser: So that's one we don't usually go into. Those clients aren't active anymore, most of them. But then I started scrolling through and some of them are coming up as [PERSON-17] clients.
EndUser: And I'm like, wait [TIME-4], wait, whoa, why did it change event names?
EndUser: You know, it shouldn't have. And again, that's a glitch I wouldn't have never caught unless I backtracked. You know, because it shouldn't, it should, but the information still should have gone over.
EndUser: It just would have been in a different campaign.
Agent: Understood.
EndUser: That's fine. The campaign name's being a mess again. The problem is client missing, outright missing.
Agent: And are these, and just to like, you know, clarify as well, like, are you speaking, you know, clients from existing clients list or clients that attended the seminars?
EndUser: Client said, I attended a seminar we're still calling on. Like, let me look up one that I sent to.
Agent: Are they, are they fast-fx or are they already sent business with?
Agent: [PERSON-19], financial.
EndUser: Probably prospects, but they're still clients out.
Agent: Oh,
EndUser: If they attended an event, they're like, oh, call me in [DATE-37]. Well, okay, you know, the problem.
Agent: Okay. So, yeah, prospects, prospects then. Okay. Because I was too confused with your existing clientele and then, okay.
EndUser: So let me look at one. Yeah. So everybody in [PRODUCT-1], we put everybody in [PRODUCT-1]. If they reach out to us, if they come to an event, if they give us information, we put it in the database.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Automatically, automatically. So I'm looking up one.
Agent: And would you say that out of your existing clients that have signed business with [PERSON-18], would you say they are in [ORG-3] or at least in the same?
EndUser: I don't know. I have to live in, I'm feeling like I have to go through every one of our clients. And that's going to take me forever. Like I'm going to not have to sleep is my fear.
Agent: Yeah. I'm going to see if there's a tool that maybe
EndUser: So I'm looking up taxes only and I have a file maker. My taxes only clients, there's seven people in file maker. And I know I exported that over to [PERSON-3]. So let's see if that's in here.
EndUser: Because I know I did. I sent it over to her. So, and it's called taxes only.
EndUser: Okay, that's what I called it. I sent it to her.
EndUser: There's nothing.
Agent: In can you repeat that one more time?
Agent: Can...
EndUser: So, from file maker, it's called taxes only, and there should be seven clients in that one.
Agent: Tax is only.
EndUser: Act is only.
Agent: And these are clients that do business with [ORG-9]. That's perfect.
EndUser: They get their taxes done with us. Yes. So they're allowed to get their taxes done with us.
Agent: Ok, perfect.
EndUser: That's what their event name is in [PRODUCT-1]. I just typed that in over on [ORG-3]. It's not in there at all. And I know I sent that to her.
Agent: And you said it's an event that you also did.
EndUser: It would be a campaign for you.
Agent: Okay, I got it. I'm also looking at the audit [PRODUCT-2].
EndUser: It's not on her sheet at all.
Agent: No, it's not.
EndUser: No, if you look at the one I sent over, the printout, I said, missing from [ORG-3].
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Jetpack, [DATE-33] Viva, and [ORG-10].
Agent: Yeah, what you had.
EndUser: Those are events that are in [PRODUCT-1], but they are not anywhere in [ORG-3].
Agent: Yeah. Yes, got it.
EndUser: And that's [PERSON-18] in [ORG-10], that never made it over to [ORG-3].
EndUser: So that's concerning.
Agent: The three. Yeah.
EndUser: Because I know I exported that over to her quite a while ago. And I thought I said seven people so I should have gone over.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: You know, that's deep.
Agent: What?
Agent: Okay. Let me try to get a hold of [ORG-6] and see where they're at with their status on everything and how they feel about, you know, [DATE-8]'s meeting.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: I know for a fact that [PERSON-13], my manager, [PERSON-17], they're going to be working with [PERSON-9] for an appropriate resolution and they're meeting on [DATE-35].
EndUser: And the end.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: So that's definitely, you know, all the concerns, every feedback that we received and, you know, everything towards, you know, building a relationship with us is going to be, you know, it's, It's all on the table and like we're all working through this.
Agent: So, and everyone's committed.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: So, at least, you know, for us, [PERSON-13], [PERSON-17], myself, and I know I'm no longer like a line-to-be-count, but, you know, we're trying, yeah, we're definitely working towards at least finding an appropriate resolution and making this, you know, as successful as we want to.
EndUser: Right. I I know.
Agent: I know everyone on your team has been, you know, adamantly, pushing for [ORG-3] and working towards, you know, making it happen and making it happen.
EndUser: We've been trying to get this working, but
Agent: Right.
EndUser: When you know [PERSON-3] tells me, yeah everything's good and then I find out and not so much.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And had I had [DATE-18] found out this was a problem I would have attacked it [DATE-18].
Agent: Yeah, rather than the rather than.
EndUser: [DATE-45] before my deadline and literally I have [PERSON-9] hammering me going hey why isn't this working?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: What did you do wrong?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And I'm like I did nothing wrong. I've you know contacted people, I've been on the up and up. That's why I see [PERSON-18] and every single one of my emails.
Agent: Yeah, has [PERSON-5] been supporting you with any of the transfers at all?
EndUser: And much as he can, but he's frustrated too.
Agent: Yeah, of course.
EndUser: But you know, even if I have support, [PERSON-9] wants to see a result. [PERSON-9] is a result man. He doesn't care about talk.
Agent: Yeah, of course.
EndUser: He sees results. And right now, he's seeing a mess up.
Agent: Yeah, no.
EndUser: And I'm the target.
Agent: Understand. Yeah.
EndUser: You know, and he keeps, you know, joking around a previous employee and their CEO got fired because this was messed up. And I'm like, whoa, wait [TIME-4]. I've been doing everything I can to make this work.
EndUser: You know.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So now it looks like I'm getting in trouble.
EndUser: You know, often I'm like, wait [TIME-4] for what?
Agent: Yeah, is [PERSON-9] attending [DATE-8]'s session as well with I am.
EndUser: No, no, he's not in town until [DATE-35].
Agent: Oh yeah, he's in [GPE-3], correct?
EndUser: Yeah, that's why I need like, I need somebody to say, hey, it wasn't him fault.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: We don't know what the problem is, you know, because I can see my due diligence.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna. But I'm gonna.
EndUser: Now I'm finding out a day before there's an issue and that is a big problem.
Agent: Absolutely. Yeah, we don't we definitely want to point anything. And we know that you have been doing absolute best and doing wonderful attitude. So, um, and I know it's a huge undertaking.
Agent: You know, you're a lot of change management. You're coming from old systems, new processes. And it. It's a huge load. So I'm going to talk with [PERSON-13] as well, because she's, I'm covering for her.
Agent: She's coming back from [GPE-4]. She had like a family event. She returns [TIME-8]. I'll speak to her. I'll make sure that she also gets a message out to [PERSON-9], not directing any blame or any mis-comings towards you.
Agent: A lot of it had to do with just the general data transfer. And it's not easy. And I know, you know, that's it. I've been with [ORG-3] for [DATE-52], [PERSON-17], even longer, like eight.
Agent: And we've seen this from time to time again. It does require a lot of patience, but moving from internal systems, like entirely switching everything over is always a huge process.
Agent: On average, we also work with like larger companies, even with like 181 plus employees, you know, their SOWs for For these type of migrations are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and they're massive undertaking.
Agent: And usually it takes [DATE-50] for a full completion of migration. So, you know, it is a complex process and we definitely feel you for all the frustrations and everything that you've shared.
Agent: But we definitely have your back. We'll do everything we can to, you know, make sure that it continues to be seamless and like, you know, we find a resolution in that our account team is.
Agent: Supporting this and of course if there's anything else like you know I know [PERSON-13] really cares about you guys myself of course tell us as much as invested so you know come [DATE-35] when we talk with [PERSON-9] and then also talk about this process.
Agent: We're not going to put any blame towards how this has happened on you.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: And of course, [ORG-6], I selected [ORG-6] because they're a great Marketing partner. And coming from understanding [PERSON-5]'s goals and your goals for growth, I knew that they'd be a suitable partner.
Agent: They're also heavily favored within the small business space of 10 to 24 employees. So we thought it would have been a great fit. Of course, I think none of us had known the huge task.
Agent: It would take transferring everything from file maker, a system like that into [ORG-3]. And so I do want to relay our expression of, you know, like, sorry, I hadn't been as seamless as we wish it could have been.
Agent: So, you know, we're what?
EndUser: Well, as long as [PERSON-9] understands, it's not on me.
Agent: Yeah, of course.
EndUser: He can all...
Agent: We'll definitely, we'll definitely express that to him. Yeah, and we know you've been doing your best and you know you have a lot on your plate.
EndUser: Yeah, cause...
Agent: You've been doing a lot for the company for yourself. And you know we definitely don't want you having any blame on this matter whatsoever. So we'll express that [PERSON-9] as well. And we'll take some.
EndUser: I hope so.
Agent: Yeah, we'll take in.
EndUser: I appreciate it because right now it's all on me.
Agent: We'll definitely take some accountability here for you know in terms of just like the partner. partner choice. I'm G historically I've worked with them several times and have been great.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: And typically they're usually moving accounts from [ORG-8] Sheets or something simple like just [PRODUCT-4]. And historically those have always been easier.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: But then I think for something as robust as [PRODUCT-1] that you guys have been using for [DATE-55], it will definitely.
EndUser: It's right.
Agent: Massive, massive load.
EndUser: So, Yeah, and they said, hey, you need your IT person to do that. I would have done that.
Agent: Yeah, yeah.
EndUser: But they said, no, just do this and it's fine. So I did the thing.
EndUser: I literally had them on [ORG-12] with me and [PERSON-5] going, okay, how do I do that?
Agent: Right. Right.
EndUser: And I did a couple test runs and it worked. So I was like, oh, then it should work. And it should have worked.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And it didn't.
EndUser: And when I asked [PERSON-3], hey, did it work?
EndUser: She was like, yeah, no problem. Nope, problem. And I wish I would have been informed, hey, there's been an issue. Let's get on a call and double check things.
Agent: Right, right.
EndUser: I think that's what affixed everything of her working with me on a couple of these issues that I brought up.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And then, yeah, no, it's fine. We'll get it worked out. No, no, and she might be very busy and I understand that. I do. I was one person. She's probably doing 61 billion other people, people's data stuff.
EndUser: You know, and I want to try to be understanding, but now my job's on the line.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: So hopefully [PERSON-9] will understand it. So that I didn't, I've done everything on my part, you know, part.
Agent: Of course you did.
Agent: And your touch was a part of the company came and you've been there for, you know, how long?
EndUser: [DATE-50], for lying long here.
Agent: No one understands your financial what it needed. So I totally understand where you're coming from.
Agent: We will ensure that [PERSON-9] is fully aware of, you know, the frustrations that have been happening and down or taking, we'll try to direct as much blame away from anyone on your team specifically and more so on Implementation and us and see how we can help with some resolution.
Agent: Of course, I try to look at the big picture in terms of these things as well. You've got most of the majority of your clients in there, like your current client.
EndUser: I think so.
Agent: You know, your advisor is able to use it. in a longer activity.
Agent: Part of the issue of why you guys are moody self-worths because you didn't have the visibility to how your employees work and manage their book of business. And so that's there now.
Agent: And again, it's all about getting into phase two.
Agent: [PERSON-9] had said, how do you continue to maximize the solution?
EndUser: So Yeah, well we're not even not a face one yet until everybody's over.
Agent: I know there is minor details in there, but I. I know and I have full confidence that we'll get to that base too very soon.
Agent: You know, just a couple more people and you say be added into the sales force. But again, you're dealing with like 10 to thousands of records to try to.
Agent: So I totally understand how frustrating and time consuming that can be. So yeah.
EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Well, when it comes to [PERSON-3], I just need her to be transparent with me. Hey, I just put, you know, imported this guy over or this event over or whatever you want to call it.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Double check your numbers real quick. Had she done that when I did everything, you know, as numbers matching, I would have been able to go, oh, we have a problem.
Agent: Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: Let's figure it out.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But now I'm deadline. So, you know, that's my frustration.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It had a. Yeah, had I known there was issue, had I known that she wouldn't have gotten everything pointed over [DATE-55]?
Agent: I'll address that to her. Yeah.
EndUser: Then it went a bit a big deal.
EndUser: I would have gone, hey, how can I help you?
EndUser: Let's sit down and figure this out.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: What don't you have?
EndUser: Because here's what I have.
EndUser: What don't you have?
EndUser: Let's fix it.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But now I'm like, my god, what happened?
EndUser: Where do things not happen?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Why do things not get over?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You know, now I'm having a backtrack and it's really frustrating. It's very angry. I guess.
Agent: I understand that.
EndUser: So, let's hope we can come up with a resolution where I don't lose my job.
Agent: Of course. And we'll... We're going to take as much accountability and blame here as possible and then come to resolution with [PERSON-9]. Again, you have our leaders and [PERSON-24] talking [DATE-37].
Agent: Can I discuss everything?
EndUser: And I do apologize, you have to deal with him, because I know how much he should be a pill.
Agent: No, it's okay.
EndUser: I mean, I love the man, but he's a pill.
Agent: And
EndUser: I get it. I know he's hard to talk to and hard to work with. You know, that's why I've been trying to be not that person, but now I'm like, <inaudible> people.
Agent: Then we'll leave.
Agent: Yeah. And it's totally okay. Yeah, no worries. I mean, we work with him. You know, he's paid the bill. We have to come up with a resolution on our end to see how we can continue to Support this.
Agent: And again, at DNA, we want nothing but, you know, your guys' success with our platforms. And I know it's still a massive undertaking to confirm everything that has gone through, but, Yeah, we're in this together.
Agent: And so we'll do everything that we can to Support you guys. And especially you and your job, because we understand how about it.
EndUser: Appreciate that.
Agent: Of course.
EndUser: I like being able to come to work. So, I think, all right, [PERSON-18], I appreciate it.
Agent: That's do I. Yeah.
EndUser: Hopefully we can get some resolution going because, thank More.
Agent: Yeah. I'll contact [PERSON-13], too. I've managers looked in on all this.
EndUser: You.
Agent: We have our call [DATE-8] with [ORG-17]. I'm going to send [PERSON-3] a note right now about some of those different clients.
Agent: I know she made those notes for the, I know she made those notes in this spreadsheet, but then there's still the ones you haven't read.
Agent: Which one is, so I know you made those notes in red on [DATE-8] and [DATE-9]. I'll see you with the statuses with [PERSON-18], she can do the taxes only, and then See what it's talking about.
EndUser: Yes, [PERSON-18] may not have any clients in it, so don't stress over that one two but like [EVENT-1] had some people in it, TACS has only had people in it, and I'm still trying to do some cleanups.
EndUser: Like I said, I understand that my events and my campaigns got a little muddled.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That's because a file maker haven't been glitched, but I didn't even know about that.
Agent: Yeah, so.
EndUser: So I am not standing, but...
Agent: Yeah. Okay.
EndUser: The big thing is making sure that everybody from [DATE-36], or I'm sorry, from [DATE-39] to current, everything that I exported over is in [PRODUCT-1] because those I know are actual client clients.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: You know, that's when I started in [DATE-39]. So that's when, you know, I can track from that.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay. I would just ensure that the most valuable data, say for example, you're existing top tier clients who invest a lot with [PERSON-18], they're definitely in [ORG-3].
EndUser: You know,
Agent: [PERSON-9], is that good?
EndUser: If I can. Yeah, there should be 57 of those.
Agent: Yeah, because of course these events, I know with these events a lot of these seminars, attendees can fall to the cracks, but then like, you know, the main viable assets that should be in sales force are in sales force.
Agent: And then all these additional, you know, like a tending point through or whatever.
EndUser: Well, like I...
Agent: That's there at least mostly converted. But I would say.
EndUser: Well, like, you did the top tier because I did like top tier.
Agent: Part of.
EndUser: And I'm getting out of, if I do a top tier look up from my file maker, I have 83 entries.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But go over to the [ORG-3], I have five.
Agent: Is that with the campaigns or is that like?
EndUser: Well, no.
Agent: Mm
EndUser: In File Maker, that's a checkbox, not even an event. It's a checkbox that we hit.
Agent: Hmm. Like if you don't want.
EndUser: I typed in
Agent: So and what is it in [ORG-3]?
Agent: Is it a is it also like a rating?
EndUser: Top here. Yeah, it should be a check box I believe. Let me get into a file. Hang on [TIME-1].
Agent: But all the clients are. Okay.
EndUser: I don't know. I'm going to have to go through and make sure they're all in there. There's 79 people on my file maker.
EndUser: So I'm going to type in each one of those names in the [ORG-3] and make sure they have a file.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: And they should be coming up through either accounts or contacts.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm going to type that in.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But like see, I'm opening, oh, it is really slow [DATE-37].
EndUser: What is going on?
EndUser: There it goes. There we go.
EndUser: So what is top tier?
EndUser: So top tier in [ORG-3] is a checkbox as well as well.
Agent: Okay, so they created that field for you guys.
EndUser: Yeah, that field is a check mark here in [ORG-3]. It's also a check mark in [ORG-13].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So like if I'm looking at my file maker screen at the very top towards the right hand side, there's two little block check boxes that are top tier and tax preparer.
EndUser: So they're checked if they get their tax done and they're checked if they're a top tier client. And like this client I'm looking at right now, he's a top tier client. He's been with us since fricking forever.
EndUser: Let me be honest with you. I've known this guy since I've been here.
Agent: Okay. Okay. Yeah.
EndUser: He's been here quite a long time. Let me find out his last notes.
Agent: And then account history, at least most of it is until sports.
EndUser: But I know of, let me pull him up, hang on a second, let me just pull him up.
Agent: Okay. Okay. Because yeah, I mean, these cross-checkings are going to they're definitely very time consuming. It is very manual. It is very.
EndUser: A And I'm fine to do that, but had I known this was a problem early on?
Agent: [DATE-36]. Yeah.
EndUser: I would have been able to do this like spend some time and just take care of it.
Agent: No.
EndUser: It looks like his stuff is in here.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah?
EndUser: Someone I'm seeing is in here?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Like his wife?
Agent: Okay. And it's mostly campaigns that have had some these campaigns.
EndUser: Or best up?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And again, I think that's not just on her side, but also my file maker. It seems to have a glitch that I had no idea was a glitch.
EndUser: Because I wouldn't have known these are, you know, from [DATE-45], you know, that events that we had in [DATE-45].
Agent: These are records that you weren't even a part of.
EndUser: Yeah, I wasn't even here. I would never have gone into. I just did the export because I thought, oh, bold night. So I typed in bold night. My events export everything over, boom, done.
EndUser: But I'm going through it and going, wait [TIME-4]. Those shouldn't be in bold night. Those should be in.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Something else, you know, and they're popping up on something else, and something happened on [ORG-13], which I would have never known happened.
Agent: Correct.
EndUser: Because, again, I never go in there. You know, I usually look clients up by name, not by event.
Agent: Yeah, and as long as you can still do that in [ORG-3], I think that's one of the.
EndUser: And as we go, we'll clean it up, you know, we'll fix the, oh, you see what in that event, you're in this event, we fix that, you know, type thing.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: And we could, that's, you know.
Agent: Well, I would, I would address the [PERSON-9] who came like, and I'll have [PERSON-13] mention this as well. Um, you know, like the core data is in so far.
Agent: It's like everyone's able to do the job with the core
EndUser: It, yes, we can still get in there. There's just some glitches and hiccups that we need to clean up.
Agent: Data. And of course, yeah.
EndUser: How do I know, you know, had [PERSON-3] told me, hey, I'm seeing that you said this number is not matching up with this number.
EndUser: Can we sit down and look at this?
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Then I would have gone, oh, here's the problem. And we could have addressed it. Now I'm scrambling. I literally feel like I'm having an anxiety attack scrambling, trying to teach you.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, I would again have to jump to another meeting soon came, but I will.
EndUser: So that's the thing. Yes, yes.
Agent: Yeah, I would just, you know, continue to think about it, like in terms of, you know, like. All the core information that you need to do your [DATE-61] job is that like in [ORG-3].
Agent: And so, you know, we got the, we got pretty much what we were supposed to get in done.
Agent: And now it's just like, again, like those tiny kinks that needed to be worked out, small little data transfer that may have fallen back.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Well, the big issue was Number one, why did [PERSON-3] wait until [DATE-26] to finally get everything over?
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Because she, you know, she emailed us the third that, yeah, everything's done now.
Agent: And I'll, I'll just.
EndUser: It's like, well, why wasn't it done in [DATE-6]?
EndUser: And then now we can do the cleanup. The second thing is, I wish [PERSON-8] would have been a lot more clear about getting the contact information from the [PRODUCT-3] side ported over to the account management side.
EndUser: Happy... No one that needed to happen, we would have already had that done. Now we're still waiting on that to happen.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: There's still some stuff missing.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Those are two big ones.
EndUser: Is I feel like I was not made aware that there was still a lot, like 126 things, what did it take until [DATE-18] to do?
EndUser: You know what I mean?
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. These campaigns are not as well.
EndUser: Yeah, they're massive, but she could have told me that [PERSON-24] was still getting some, you know, she kept telling me, oh, there's just a few more to go.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Oh, there's a few more to go. is not a few more.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: You know. And then there's still some people missing that I'm trying to find.
Agent: Ok. OK, I have a I have a meeting. I need to jump to him, but I'm going to address all these concerns, especially the one I'm gene to.
EndUser: There you are.
Agent: So his book is back. You know, we have her call [DATE-8].
Agent: I'm sure that she gets a note out to [PERSON-9] that he is fully aware of like kind of where we at and, you know, some of the concerns ahead of [DATE-35]. So when he comes back, you know, like.
Agent: You know, again, we'll reiterate, you know, the course sales force is in there. Um, you know, your employees are able to do their job, of course.
EndUser: I'm saying.
Agent: Um, there is still just like, you know, minor data points that you're going to be completed, but.
EndUser: Can Yeah, but there is disappointment.
Agent: You hear me?
EndUser: Yeah, I can hear you say that's okay.
Agent: Yeah, of course. Sorry, I cut off a bit. Um, well, yeah, I have a problem.
EndUser: No problem. Getting chair of the meeting. I don't want to hold you up.
Agent: No problem. Thank you so much [PERSON-18] for all everything you shared.
Agent: And then again, we'll be in touch with [PERSON-9] and then I'm going to send it out to [PERSON-3] ahead of like, you know, we have a call [DATE-8], but kind of where we're at and You know, the general consensus of things.
Agent: So I'll get all that out there. And then, you know, me and my team are definitely going to work with towards a resolution of [PERSON-9].
Agent: So at least he feels more operate and the work that you've done more concrete in the solution and more concrete and you know going into phase two two So we're in here or with you guys you know hand by hand that's throughout this whole process.
Agent: And it was never supposed to be as seamless and easy.
Agent: And again, it is like a crawl, walk, run, and we're still crawling, but we're with you here to ensure that we're all kind of running together at the same pace.
EndUser: All right. Thanks, [PERSON-20]. I appreciate it.
Agent: No problem, things are more similar, goodbye.
EndUser: Take care. Bye-bye.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1.

voice_18093_167_0LQ3y0000098FihGAE,"Agent: [PERSON-1] could Call me back on a Recorded line. Sorry, I have to say that.
EndUser: So, and you said you were with [ORG-1], but working with [ORG-2]?
Agent: So I was with [ORG-1]. Yeah, yeah, I'm part of the [ORG-3] account support team.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: I started relatively recently.
Agent: I just wanted to call and introduce myself, but also part of my role is just to get feedback from our customers on how they're using the platform and if they have anything that they want us to know and, you know, it makes it valuable information for us because it helps us, you know, build a better product and, you know, implement updates to features and etc, etc.
Agent: So I, if you have [TIME-1], I was open to pick your brain apart from just introducing myself, but if now is not a good time, I'm happy to like, you know, set a short meeting [DATE-1] or early next.
Agent: It's really whatever is best for you.
EndUser: No, it's good. It's good. So to put things in perspective, I don't use [ORG-1]. I help other people use it. So I write reports.
Agent: Interesting.
EndUser: I put together any report or type of reporting system that needs to be updated, like report types. I'm much more behind the scenes. I'm more of an IS support or IT support.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: And most of my reporting that can be done in [ORG-1] is extremely limited to me. So most of the stuff that goes beyond just the regular querying of information.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: It's
Agent: Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
Agent: I'm just trying to understand how you specific. Because I see that you're like a systems administrator and looking at your LinkedIn.
EndUser: Well, we need. So we need. So the things that we need in report writing straight out is stuff that we would have had to go to like wave, I guess now it's like [PERSON-2], things like that.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: So for anything beyond. simple reporting. I mean simple reporting, our data is say at times semi-structured. So there's no modeling capability other than leaving [ORG-1] and going to an app.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: We don't have access to be able to go in and say, okay, add a whole bunch of new formula fields and do all this fancy stuff because our system is just too big already of an Implementation to continually add new fields that way.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: So for us, we generally take all of our stuff out of [ORG-1] and do all the reporting outside of it.
Agent: Oh, so what you like you?
Agent: Do you, so you export it, sorry, you were saying to [PERSON-2] or like some other data visualization tool?
EndUser: It's an ETL. No, it's an ETL out to a AWS server.
Agent: Oh, gotcha.
EndUser: Yeah, and then from there we can port it to just about anything.
Agent: Do you have a preferred data visualization tool that you are working with?
EndUser: Well, we've used, well, some of the stuff that we have used to help us with some of the maintenance type stuff.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Like Cloud Dango and we had the CR infusion product, we utilize cognos. We do a lot of stuff outside with cognos and just straight stuff from cognos.
EndUser: Then we take it from even that output and we do stuff to it as well. But we were using Wave. I guess it was [PERSON-3] or Wave, I can't remember. I can't remember the name of it.
EndUser: It was Wave, I think.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: And we then started using [PERSON-2], and we no longer use [PERSON-2]. And there's other products out there that, like the [ORG-4] product, which is escaping my head right now, [ORG-5].
Agent: The power BI. OK.
EndUser: Thank you. So we do some in [ORG-6] BI. But mostly, you know, we struggle because... You know, sometimes there's just simple things we need to do with the data because it's not quite structured.
EndUser: We need to be able to utilize the type of feature that was put in between classic and lightning, be able to do row level formulas, to be able to compare fields together, such as I want to be able to check one field against another.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: I want to know if the site is matching up with say the shipping city.
EndUser: So I want to know all of the, I want to be able to run, you know, against two different fields and be able to compare strings against each other.
Agent: Yeah, okay.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: Right, I think.
Agent: So comparing strings and pardon me for sort of, it makes me wonder, like, are you guys leveraging generative [PRODUCT-1] yet in any capacity?
EndUser: No.
Agent: Cause no, none.
EndUser: No, not at all. Yeah, not at all.
Agent: Yeah, cause I know sometimes with the hallucinations, you can't,
EndUser: You know, because of our, so we're kind of at an infant stage as far as,
EndUser: We're actually working on that outside the product so that what we are working on is, say, formulating the data so that we can and leverage some stuff. We just don't have enough information on it.
EndUser: We're very centric on a very key piece of information, and outside of that we just don't have.
EndUser: The type of information that you would have like for big data or for analyzing, say, you know, customer segments and all that stuff. So we don't really have our data set up to do that yet.
EndUser: But it's something that is in process.
Agent: Got it.
Agent: I'm sorry to keep asking this question, but can you elaborate on that?
Agent: This is definitely really helpful for us to know, just like anecdotally what customers like you are doing. It's like hearing that you're like, oh, and that, I completely understand.
EndUser: I can't tell you that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can be fairly general, but I can't really get into too many specifics.
Agent: I know that some of it is a yeah. And that's fine. I don't.
EndUser: I have to keep it very general.
Agent: I understand that there's an IP concern, like there's stuff that you're up to that you don't share with anyone outside the company. So I wouldn't want to reach that at all.
Agent: No, I'm trying to figure out, just for our team, the use cases that are either missing or lacking or that we could tweak to make it better for everybody. It's helpful for instance to hear.
EndUser: I can't even begin to go into those details. I apologize for that, but.
Agent: Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm already just hearing how the, hearing how you're doing the, you know, the [ORG-7] to, you know, [PRODUCT-2] and whatever some of the other ones were, like hearing how many other platforms you're using with the data.
Agent: That's just useful for us to know, not just in terms of spirant, but just, you know, everyone in the telecom space. So that's largely the sector that I support.
EndUser: Yeah. My biggest beef with [ORG-1] is that it started out early on after, let's just say, after [DATE-2] of ACPAC, when ACPAC kind of got bought by [ORG-8] or best, I guess it was best software back then.
EndUser: And [ORG-1] started to become a marketable product. One of the things that the online or web share in platforms lacked was reporting. and within the product. And it has not changed since.
EndUser: It has barely gotten any updates, barely gotten any better.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Most of the stuff that people request. I mean, we are having to do so many iterative reports just to change like some little things. So we'll have, we'll have 13 reports.
EndUser: It's the same report, but you have to continually go back in. and set it up with the, you have to go back in and change the filters for this group.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: And then you go back in and you set it up for another group, but they, but they don't want to lose their reports. So you end up saving, somebody ends up saving each of those reports along the way.
EndUser: So you can't make standard reporting that way.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: So we try to make some, you know, we utilize dashboards as much as possible, but, you know, it really is limiting on how much you can leverage inside, you know, for the data, data modeling.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It really can't do very much in it. It's very limited and it always has been.
Agent: So you just wish it was like a more robust option in terms of like business intelligence and like other platforms basically.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, why wouldn't it be?
EndUser: I mean, it's self-force has been [DATE-3], [DATE-4] or so, right?
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah, [DATE-5] coming up [DATE-6].
EndUser: Right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: So, and I was part, so the funny thing is I was part of beta testing for some of the early [PRODUCT-3] platforms. I was, I worked for a company called [ORG-9].
Agent: .
EndUser: And we were one of the first, you know, pentop handwriting capable on the NORNs, and the old NORNs. And we were the first [PRODUCT-4] platform on them. And we developed, we were one of the early developers.
EndUser: And that ended up being, I guess it was bought by some, after we got like [ORG-10] platforms and got off synchronization.
EndUser: Remember for like client, remote clients?
EndUser: You used to have to pick up your phone and dial it in. Yeah, that's ultimately where I came from.
EndUser: So we developed that up into online and then transferred everything to online, right?
Agent: Yeah, so yeah, I.
EndUser: So it's all connection now.
Agent: Yeah, that is like back before everything was just like hosted, you know, in the cloud.
EndUser: Yeah, it was host and it was server and it was client server.
Agent: Yeah, before before SaaS before software is a service.
EndUser: Yeah. And so the product that we built was much bigger than [ORG-1] as far as order, you know, the order taking the, the quoting ordering whole side of it, the say, serve it is and stuff like that.
EndUser: We just have to build yourself in [ORG-1].
EndUser: You know, and I think even our company, we instead of trying to build the entire thing, we opted to use a company called [ORG-11].
Agent: So
EndUser: We utilize quite a few [ORG-11] products.
Agent: I know that we have just separate to the dialogue you and I are having right now.
Agent: I know that there is like a running dialogue between other members of... the [ORG-2] account team here at [ORG-1] and some of your colleagues at [ORG-2].
Agent: But would you have any interest in chatting with one of our solutions engineers, for instance, or just someone who is probably more technically capable than me to sort of see if there's any use cases that you'd like in [ORG-1] that are available, but like just haven't been well advertised or
EndUser: Well, it's mostly, so I came out of it.
EndUser: So I was an architect, a developer and an architect certified with a different company, right?
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: That did [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And it was [ORG-8] CRM products and integration and beta testing for integration in the back end and [PRODUCT-5], the mass products, the accounting, the [ORG-11] and accounting products. I don't do that anymore.
EndUser: And I'm kind of out of the picture, I'm in more like sales marketing now for some reason. And I don't belong to the IT department.
EndUser: But realistically, the IT department would need to be the group to do that with, I believe.
Agent: Got it. And I, um, candidly, I'm, I'm so new to [ORG-1] as an employee that I'm not quite up to snuff on what running dialogue there is with it.
Agent: Um, like for instance, let me just pull it up right here. Like, I know there's a running dialogue right now, but I don't know which portion of our, you know, behemoth of a multi-clad solution is pink discussed.
Agent: It might not be with it. It might be, you know, with, um, another one of your teams. Give me just two shakes here and I will find that out.
Agent: Yeah, it looks like it's primarily [ORG-11] and expansion of [ORG-11] at the moment.
EndUser: Yeah, so that's part of our app disc product.
Agent: Yeah. Let
Agent: Me see. So, you're more in sales and marketing not IT and you're basically just fielding lots of requests for iterative reports and it's just they just pile up.
EndUser: Well, let's just, yeah, well, let's fair is fair. When they can't figure out how to do it, they call me.
EndUser: So I'm like, say a regular user, yeah, say a user, like a regular user, say at level three, and then you have the report authors, and when the report authors get stuck, they call me.
Agent: And I know you're paying that was my last role.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: So generally, the stuff I work on is usually outside the realm of basic sales force reporting capability or something that we just don't have enough fields available in the application to do.
EndUser: Because you don't see the formula is not like you can't just do like one big formula.
Agent: And you're using mostly, yeah, exactly.
EndUser: You do one formula. If you get five references, you can only reference five objects.
EndUser: And you're kind of stuck at, you know, it's, it's, and it doesn't work very well when you try to switch it.
EndUser: Uh, if you go from, like, if you start it and you run it for, say, a number, and then you realize that you want to change it to a text, good luck.
EndUser: You basically just have to exit out and you kind of have to just exit out and start over because it doesn't, it doesn't transfer well.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: You know, and one of the things I wish it did have is a left type of join, right?
EndUser: Where I could run, say, give me a, you know, say I wanted to find, you know, a link between, like, contracts and, say, contacts and contracts.
EndUser: That might be one where I want to know, I want to find all the costs, all the contacts.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Right for certain type of products that we have sold.
EndUser: And I wanna be able to link those two two It seems like it's extremely difficult to get those two two or like assets or assets and contacts together or But if you roll things up, I don't even see that like the way we put together.
EndUser: Unless you design the custom product like assets to customers like to app accounts, you don't set that up right with a master detail relationship.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Good luck because you go to run it and you get like two pieces of data.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And it was just somebody test data that put something in there.
Agent: Just, it's, yeah. And you spent all this time building reporting to winds up just being like relatively useless, not entirely useless, but like compared to what you were doing.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Aiming for doesn't cut the master.
EndUser: So ultimately what we end up seeing is we see hundreds and hundreds of reports being created. And there's no real good standardized management system for it.
EndUser: Just everybody has access to it and everybody's going to continually create every report they can think of for themselves.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And at this point, yeah.
Agent: Kindly we, you know, bet there is a bit of that. in our own instances of [ORG-1]. Lots of people just making personal reports for themselves, but if you wanted to like, you know, view all, my God.
Agent: It's a lot.
EndUser: Well, I can't even find what I need. So if I'm looking for somebody's report, I have access to everybody's reports.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I can't find them because it does like 13, reports and then cuts it off.
Agent: Interesting.
EndUser: And I can't find the report I'm looking for, because there's too many hits coming back. And you can't seem to do a advanced search. Like, you can't say that.
EndUser: Well, I want to find all the ones that have either of these two words and or both of these words, and it was created by this person, or. You can't do that.
EndUser: You can just put it in the search text and you just boom. You get. Well, you've got is showing 14 of, you know, 188.
EndUser: It's like, well, that doesn't do any good because the one I'm looking for is not there.
Agent: Yeah, you just want to scroll through. So,
Agent: Not to change this entirely here, but you mentioned like you're on the sales and marketing sites.
Agent: I think I have a good sense of how you're, what limitations you're running into in terms of like our Sales Cloud and the reporting there. But you also mentioned marketing.
Agent: I'm curious what you guys like, how are exactly are you managing. marketing, at least in relation to [ORG-1].
Agent: Like, are you able to map a customer's journey?
Agent: Like, like in terms of brand management, or are you really only using [ORG-1] just for, you know, the sales cycle in that process?
EndUser: So we have a marketing group side from, so I'm in more of sales and marketing support.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: So the marketing department, I think they utilize another product like [ORG-10]. And then for a lot of stuff that we do for reaching our customers or contacts.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: Kind of have to put together a kind of system of finding the relationship, excuse me, sorry, trying to find the relationship between the two.
Agent: No, it's no problem at all. Take your time.
EndUser: So it's more of fuzzy logic where I want to be able to find all the contacts that belong to this situation.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: Well, there's no real link between those contacts. and either the order or the contract or the purchase or the purchaser. You don't know if the purchaser is the same one that you've set out campaigns to.
EndUser: And you really have to try to bring that all together.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And if these, the people in our company are different departments that handle each of the areas, they're using different contacts.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So there's no relationship between the contacts. and the system in which we put together,
Agent: No, no, you're saying no relationship between like contact records in your marketing platform and your sales platform, that should be linked because they're the same person, but because it's different platforms and you're having to use.
EndUser: It's not the same.
Agent: Fuzzy logic to it.
EndUser: No, it's not the same person, that's the problem.
Agent: Oh, it's not this important. Got it.
EndUser: No, because the person that you originally had the lead with may be on the opportunity, but then when it gets to the proposal, it's somebody else.
EndUser: And when they give it to the order, you may end up with the same person or someone else because the purchaser is now involved.
EndUser: And so when it gets through to the campaign, you look at the campaign and say, well, how did we do on this campaign?
EndUser: You say, well, we don't know because we don't know who bought it is not the same people we sent it to.
Agent: Got it. Got it. Yeah, I got sound very frustrating.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: So my job, yeah, well, my job is to link those two two in some fashion that is not, I'm not going to say believable, but at some point I have to put it together in some way that I have to justify the numbers that I'm linking together to make sure that, hey, you know, I have to, I have to compare it against residual, like the initial, like where were we [DATE-7] versus after the fact, what changed?
Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: So I have to do that comparison type of analysis. That way, I have to verify. I end up verifying whether the change is significant or not significant.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: And there's no way to do that in self-force. So you pretty much have to do it all outside.
Agent: So again, I, by no means am asking you to disclose anything that you're not a liberty to, but like, do you, so you run, do you also support [ORG-10] or are you like when it comes to marketing, like, what's your involvement in their platforms?
EndUser: No. I am able to get them contact lists for the target list. So when they have new products,
EndUser: When they have discontinued products, when they want to promote something in a particular area or a particular type of customers, I get I end up helping them come up with the target list.
Agent: [PERSON-4] and like are you building personas that way?
Agent: Like based off of the records you have in [ORG-1] and just sort of trying to create like a similar acronym of that in [ORG-10] and you'd sort of essentially, you know, tell them the criteria they need and then they go about generating that themselves in [ORG-10].
EndUser: Well, believe it or not, it's two different groups.
Agent: I do believe it actually.
EndUser: So, so prod. So, so again, you know, it's, it's, it's, here's, here's what I, here's what I know about, uh, the [PRODUCT-3] products like this, like [ORG-1]. Because I was on a very similar platform.
EndUser: In fact, so similar, they shared the same errors in them.
Agent: Vary.
EndUser: So I worked with [ORG-13]. So, ACPAC was broken up and part of it was sold to [ORG-18].
EndUser: I then worked for [ORG-18] and [ORG-8], [ORG-8] software, right?
EndUser: They own ACPAC. But when I originally found [ORG-1] and got into the architecting of [ORG-1], I found out that very similar tables. In fact, the errors that were in the tables of ACPAC were also in [ORG-1].
Agent: Interesting.
EndUser: So my conclusion
Agent: See, I'm learning more about this. I'm learning about our product from you right now.
EndUser: From that was somebody ported what was in [ORG-13] to [ORG-1] initially. That's what I could get out of it.
Agent: No, I'm not trying to sell you anything.
EndUser: So anyway, being after the same.
Agent: I'm curious.
EndUser: It was initially for what I can tell, never intended for ERP. right, never intended for large corporations. Right.
EndUser: I would say a couple hundred, you know, and it just seems like it got scaled up because it's, it's, it's lacking some very basic things that like, so I worked in salesforce automation.
Agent: But we've scaled it up anyhow. Yeah.
EndUser: So do you remember sales logics?
Agent: .
EndUser: Okay. So I worked very heavily in sales logics, but the company, The company basically worked all through business developers. So, so they didn't have the developers in-house.
EndUser: You, you basically partnered with somebody to buy the software through the partner. And that partner then helped you customize it to fit whatever you needed.
Agent: Yeah, we did something similar with with [FAC-1].
EndUser: But that product was big.
Agent: I mean, [FAC-1] is much smaller shop.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I had one of my last roles. We that's sort of how we went about designing our [PRODUCT-3] was like we figured out what we need it to do.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: And then, you know, yeah, the third party and then they, you know, you work with them over a period of [DATE-8] to build it out.
EndUser: So for me, we did the full round trip everything in the field. So we built on the platform, on the user platform, we built basically the entire front end, back end, everything on the unit.
EndUser: And then we transferred it to the back end. and it did a reconciliation between the two.
Agent: Hmm.
EndUser: So it's much, much bigger of a product.
Agent: Sounds complicated.
EndUser: So you had these heavy-duty capabilities on the user side.
EndUser: And much, much bigger for ERP, right?
EndUser: So we integrated with [PRODUCT-6] and what was the other one?
EndUser: Grab a can't remember. They have a bond system I can't remember now, it's been many years. But we were into customizing with legacy back end systems.
EndUser: Big SOP type systems being able to do the full round trip and all the transactions that were required to be passed between them.
EndUser: So for me, getting onto something like [ORG-1], it was, oh, well this would be great for a small company, right?
EndUser: Not great for a big company. I did see, I don't know if you remember like [ORG-14], yeah.
Agent: Yeah, like you're saying, it's not full-blown ERP, like an SAP or, you know, an [ORG-13] or a [ORG-18].
EndUser: It's so like comparable to like goal mine.
EndUser: You remember goal mine?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So goal mine was an initial taco type where you had your opportunities.
Agent: I actually don't.
EndUser: It started out as like a contact database and then kind of grew to opportunity and cases counts, that type of thing. Early on, some companies adopted it, but it had a really neat platform that you could use.
EndUser: You could copy it onto other platforms like another database. You could just continually just copy the database and give it to the next branch.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And all of you then had the same database, right?
EndUser: And then if you had to do like a consolidation, everybody had the same database.
EndUser: So you literally could move the database around between, you know, when you went to a centralized system, it was easy to get off of the product.
EndUser: That to me is you have basically created a system of growth, right?
EndUser: So you have a system that you can expand on.
EndUser: Well, the whole thing with [ORG-1] is that it was a, it was a user, development like [QUANTITY-1], it was basically an engine where you could build it yourself, right?
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: So technically the users who buy the product can actually update it and make new, you can make a whole new object, right?
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And so that whole platform then basically said, well then the sky's the limit, right?
EndUser: You can build anything you want. But it grew out of a... mid-size, like small to mid-size scope.
EndUser: And it just doesn't have the power, right?
EndUser: And the fact is that it's on subscription. So you had to be careful how many transactions you were creating. It's gonna only do so many transactions before you reach limits and things like that.
Agent: Mm hmm. Got it. Mm. Yeah.
EndUser: But it's a system that I see that it's a, If you do it right, you can make it fit. And if you don't do it right, it's an uncomfortable fit. And so for us,
Agent: And also to a certain extent, once something has built a certain way and habits develop, it's harder to reformat the structure and have that agility as things shift.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So you wind up locked into a way of doing things and maybe new features have come about or new products and other companies have come about.
Agent: But it's almost like... combination of the product lock-in like conundrum, but also to an extent like the feature lock-in as well.
EndUser: Yeah. So for us, we decided that we were going to keep it vanilla. And we had that going into this project for [DATE-9]. And then it completely just said, okay, we're not going to keep it vanilla.
EndUser: So one of the difficulties that we did was the back end integration. The standard back-end integration is basically picking.
EndUser: You pick, right?
EndUser: So we have [ORG-13] at [ORG-14], the Enterprise One. It's a probably written in [DATE-10], as far as the coding goes, right, it's about that time frame. It's not the object-oriented type of programming that you have [DATE-11].
EndUser: So it's an old style of system and normalization of tables relative to the time frame that it was made, it's quite different than our full relational [DATE-11], right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So instead of picking the standard way that you might consider doing it and basically say we're going to link the customer, the account, to the Enterprise account, but lo and behold, Enterprise one doesn't have an account table.
EndUser: So what do you do?
EndUser: What most people did was they picked one of the addresses, either the billing address or the shipping address.
EndUser: And they used one of those two addresses as the main address and said we're going to integrate that address with [PERSON-5]. So Enterprise 1 only has an address table. It doesn't have an account table.
EndUser: You can add an account name to the address table, but it doesn't have an address. I mean, it just only has an address table.
Agent: Yeah, and that can be very limiting, obviously, just with global, you know, you're doing business with global corporations.
EndUser: Yeah, of course.
Agent: For instance, like, I'm based on [LOC-1] and I'm the only person left in the office right now because everyone else wants to go home at five. But I'm like, I, you know, have worked to do.
Agent: I'm new on the team. I'm going to, you know, look at, you know, and for whatever reason, your office is listed on [LOC-1]. So most people wouldn't think to call, I know you are.
EndUser: I'm in [GPE-1].
Agent: Yeah, most people wouldn't think to call you at this time, at least, you know, if they're based out of this office and basically everyone on the spy room teams on [LOC-1].
Agent: But I was just picking through because I know, I'm like, I know I can, if I just like dig one step deeper, I can, you know, find people and get feedback from them.
Agent: That are based on [LOC-2]. And we have that integration with [ORG-21]. So I saw that [GPE-2], I'm like, I wonder if this guy would be chatting right now. And here we are.
Agent: So this has been extremely informative, extremely helpful for me and also, hopefully for our product team and for the team.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: So,
EndUser: Yeah, well, one of the last things I was going to say was just to fill you in anyway.
EndUser: The customization that we ended up doing for it, so instead of using the address to address table in [PERSON-5], what did we do?
EndUser: What we did was we created ourselves a new object called address table. And so we are not standard on the address.
Agent: Hmm.
EndUser: So trying to link the customer, the account address to an actual address. So we have many addresses that we can tie to an account. That's a one two many.
EndUser: So any number of billing, shipping, offices, [ORG-25] boxes doesn't really matter. we can have 94 addresses tied to an account.
Agent: Yeah. So trying to create almost like ERP functionality out of something that wasn't initially intended to have that.
EndUser: Right, because our sales force actually, no, we actually came off, this spirant came off of [PERSON-6]. And from [PERSON-6], [PERSON-6] actually had that capability where you could associate multiple addresses to an account.
Agent: God, I ended up for the idea came from basically.
EndUser: So we decided to do the same. Yeah, so we tried to take that and bring it into the same.
EndUser: Well, I mean, obviously you can see the difficulty in that because now you can easily delete links, right?
EndUser: So you're linking addresses and you can delete addresses easily.
EndUser: And you're end up <inaudible> the customer link, right?
EndUser: Because you're getting rid of the addresses.
EndUser: Or if you start moving the address around, right?
EndUser: Then the customer name is wrong and stuff like that.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So we have, say, a non-standard, by all means, a non-standard. I would say it's custom more than like your 2509 rule. I think we're 48-25.
Agent: I mean, I can definitely relate. The last roll I had was at. an investment bank that's specifically focused on mergers and acquisitions.
Agent: And I guess the sort of oversimplify way of explaining the issue we had with your standard [PRODUCT-3] is, you know, when you do your job well in mergers and acquisitions, your customer doesn't exist anymore at the end of the process.
Agent: Like there's no reason to have your typical sales funnel because, like, by the end of it, they're gone. You're not going back to them.
EndUser: They're gone. Yeah, they're gone. Yeah.
Agent: You know, like they've been absorbed or you've sold them or you know, like, um, and also you kind of need an additional sales funnel. tucked inside of the main one two run the deal.
Agent: Like, you okay, now you have a new client, your job is to sell them. Well, now that's an entirely separate process.
Agent: How do you sort of like, you know, <inaudible> dolls at inside of a CRM?
Agent: So I get what you're saying when it comes to like, you know, having to over-customize what at its heart is a pretty simple, just like managing a sales cycle.
EndUser: Yeah, our mergers are tough. Yeah, yeah, our mergers get really tough.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: You know, and.
Agent: So let me ask you this. I'm curious if there's anyone that you think I should be in touch with. Not necessarily, you know, other colleagues in business intelligence, but like specifically, oh, if you can't, then that's fine.
EndUser: You know, I can't, you know, I can't give you that, right?
Agent: I just, you know,
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, no, we're asked, we're asked never to do that.
Agent: Got it. Yeah. Well, then [PERSON-7] not telling me. And apologies if that was overstepping.
EndUser: No i mean i i mean if they're my company i would have you know i'd have a some different views uh... about you know what information you can give out uh... but they're very they're very uh... at least the company If I gave names out and it came back to me, they would be very unhappy.
Agent: Yeah, I completely understand.
EndUser: Because we've already been asked not to do that.
Agent: Got it. And I hadn't realized that or else I would not have asked. No, it's just my hand.
Agent: I know that you guys obviously have the main classic [PRODUCT-3], but I know you also have some instances for customer service and see what else you got here.
Agent: And you hit [PERSON-2], obviously, which we own, but you say you're not using that much anymore.
EndUser: Well, we had it and we were using it for [DATE-4]. And some new management came aboard and said, we're not going to use it anymore. So they got rid of it.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: And then [DATE-11], they said, Hey, you know what we should do. We should get something like tableau. You think you laugh, but I'm not joking.
Agent: No, I'm laughing because it's like, you know, same as it ever was, like, get every company in the world, you know.
EndUser: I mean, it was amazing.
Agent: Well dried.
EndUser: Now they're trying to bring it all back. So eventually we're going to be back on [PERSON-2], I guess.
EndUser: We ported everything. So we created everything in the wave on wave. And then they changed the name of it to something else. I don't think it was [PERSON-3].
EndUser: Was it?
EndUser: It was something else, a lightning, or lightning. They changed it to something else.
Agent: Honestly, I am so new that like and they change product game so much that I'm only familiar with the current naming structure and you know Lord knows they'll change those on me soon enough to.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: So we built everything. Yeah. We built everything in that platform. And then they <inaudible> that platform. They went, no, we're not going to keep this platform.
EndUser: So we, well, we ported everything and copied everything that we could out, out into [PERSON-2]. And so, by the time we actually get done, we got to use it [DATE-11].
EndUser: And then they came back and said, yeah, we're going to <inaudible> [PERSON-2]. And they basically said, yeah, we're going to go to Power BI. So we started looking at Power BI.
EndUser: And then they're saying, yeah, I don't get too involved in [ORG-6] BI because we're going to go back to [PERSON-2]. And by the way, all the stuff that you put in there is gone.
Agent: Oh God.
EndUser: So they're trying to recreate it also. Just bad timing sometimes, you know, you get into just kind of people come and go.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And you know, you do that just at the right time and that happens.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So bungee management.
Agent: Yeah, I actually haven't heard that term before and I'm going to use it.
EndUser: Look up, look up, look up [PERSON-8]. There was a comic, you know, a little like a comic strip.
Agent: I know [PERSON-8], yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, [PERSON-8].
Agent: There was a [PERSON-8] about bungee management.
EndUser: Yeah, bungee management looked that up on [PERSON-8] and you'll, you'll get like kind of what it is. It's like fast pace management where they kind of manager comes in and he goes, I'm here. I'm here to change everything.
EndUser: But he's, but you see, like he's like coming in on this bungee like sideways. And he's like, I'm changing everything.
Agent: Oh
EndUser: I'm going to go do this, don't do that. And all of a sudden, he like whips out of the scene. And everyone's like, oh, I miss him already.
Agent: Man,
Agent: Yeah everyone put their thumb prints on something, you know. That's funny.
EndUser: But I had that as a previous company. I worked for [DATE-10]. That was the lifestyle for like [DATE-13] straight.
Agent: Well, two or three is fair, that sounds like it could get pretty And I just.
EndUser: I was tough. It was a tough environment. And I had that posted on my office, on the back of my office door.
Agent: Exhausting. I'm running out of... ideas of questions to ask. I feel very enriched with information about shortcoming through.
Agent: Again, I'm so new to the company that this is probably the most substantive conversation I've been lucky enough to have, at least as of yet. And it's been really helpful.
EndUser: So the biggest advice that I would give anybody going onto [ORG-1] at this point.
EndUser: If you're a big company, right?
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: You get together with somebody that has a Professional customization shop. And we tried that. I think we partnered with [ORG-24]. And actually we tried to partner with a couple, like two or three different partners.
EndUser: And they all seem to have the same thing as a problem. is that they really don't understand the requirements, the business requirements well enough. They want to get started on, they push very hard on agile development.
EndUser: Let's get you on it, all right, and then tell us what you don't like. And then we'll change that and then we'll... Well, for a bigger company, that really is tough to do.
Agent: Hmm. Yeah.
EndUser: For a small company, it's easy. For small companies, very simple, very easy. It's a very small to mid-size concept.
EndUser: When you get into a big company and you have to actually do a rollout, and you actually have to be up and running at the rollout, at the kickoff. It doesn't work well.
EndUser: Because they they slacked on understanding the full depth of the requirements and they completely botched like half of the system.
EndUser: And so it was it was it was a it was a total bust right from the get-go and we had to spend [DATE-18] just trying to get the rest of the system up and running.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And so we had half the company like the opportunity up to the opportunity And then from there on, we are using the old system and then trying to pass it back and forth with the whole other project.
EndUser: Until we could actually get it the rest of it, all the [ORG-11] and all the order taking and the front because we do front and order taking right. So we do a front end order.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: We do we do the proposal and the order is then completed. on the front end and then the order is then transferred to the order system on our back end system. So we have orders in both systems.
EndUser: And trying to get information then back, like when it ships, assets that are done, contracts that are done, and then link those back, we have to send them back into [ORG-1] to be then reintegrated, right?
EndUser: Back to the order.
Agent: Got it. Yeah.
EndUser: So that's a tough, that's a ERP system like function. And the company that we use, [ORG-13] off, really didn't come up to speed on that initially.
EndUser: It was, basically it was a, they did about half and then didn't understand the rest.
EndUser: And so it was really, You know, they really didn't, we were asking for a lot and they didn't understand what we were asking for and thought they did. And they, you know, it's, yeah.
Agent: Again, I can relate so much to this from when we hired the developers when we were trying to build out our instance of [FAC-1].
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: It was just, I had to basically, it was my full-time job for [DATE-14] to just be in meetings with them all day and just like give microfeedback until, you know, even at the end of that, it still wasn't quite what we asked for.
Agent: And I spent [DATE-13].
Agent: On the back and just like tweaking this, tweaking that, you know, trying to get it to our original vision and I think the whole process from the original vision to completed product must have been [DATE-18] and off.
EndUser: Well,
EndUser: Yeah, so I worked for three different companies. One that made made and implemented. The software. Full round system. One that we then, two companies that I worked for as a customized architect.
EndUser: And between them all, I really found that. The failures are in the fact that we put together so many implementations. I probably put together in upwards of about 78 implementations. I mean for sizable companies, for [ORG-25], [ORG-25],
Agent: And
EndUser: [ORG-25], [ORG-35], So we did [ORG-24], we were working with [ORG-25], we worked with 7Up, [ORG-31], things like this.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean these are good, sizable companies. And what I got out of the whole experience was that most of the failures that we picked up from.
EndUser: We would get, if there was a failed [PRODUCT-7], they would hire us to come in and fix it. And so we really had a neat way of identifying what needed to be done and for what reason.
EndUser: And we were just superior company for it. And it was the two companies. One was MBSG and one was [ORG-33]. And we didn't have failed implementations. I worked with teams that were top-notch.
EndUser: So working with [ORG-24], I knew right away we had a problem.
Agent: Yeah, you can always tell.
EndUser: And when you start going into the details,
Agent: And that's not even an analytical thing. It's just like, it's just a gut feeling that like, if something's just not translating.
EndUser: Well, when you start talking about the round trip, and they're like, they have no concept of what do you mean?
EndUser: We're going to get information back. So yeah, you're going to get information back. Okay, so make sure that you have the right links between the two.
EndUser: So if we create a custom piece, say we have a, we're adding the, say, the contact onto the contract.
EndUser: Or we added on to the proposal or something like that, or the order, even the order, right?
EndUser: So we now have a primary cost person on the order. Okay, well, when I do a contact merge, I want it to get updated on the order. I don't want that link to be orphaned.
EndUser: And if you don't build it right, it orphans it.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And we have made a few of those.
Agent: And they orphaned the <inaudible> out it.
EndUser: Yeah, we have made a few of those. So I was really not impressed with the ability of the product to be configured properly.
EndUser: And having worked with a program very, very similar, if you ever look up [ORG-42], it was a very, very similar product.
EndUser: It had the same capability of building customizations and being able to change all the... You can add new tables, you can add new screens, you can add new pages, you can put in customized work pages.
EndUser: You can change all of the wording, all the captions, all the metadata, it was all accessible to the end user, say like the power users, right?
Agent: Yeah. Excuse me.
EndUser: And so when we would build something, we would build it in mind with the whole system. But that was just because of the companies that I had belong to prior. I knew to do that.
EndUser: So you know you have to put the key in there.
EndUser: It was like, well, why would you put that key in there?
EndUser: It's like, because one, you have it, two, because data is coming back, right?
EndUser: It's like, because you know, when it gets down the road and you have to then do a case, they want to know what order it came from. Right, so go ahead and put in the key there first.
EndUser: Right, so it was the, I guess being an architect, you just kind of, you learn. You're taught to do it, I guess. You teach yourself to do all of those things.
EndUser: So you don't have to go back and redesign it, right?
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And we developed some very cool things back in [DATE-13]. And it was long before, so this is back in [DATE-14] that we are developing these. So long before, say, the [PRODUCT-3] web was available, You didn't have online.
EndUser: Customers weren't online. If you needed to get, if you needed to put orders in, you had a cell phone, maybe. Most of the people that we serviced had to use the phone at the customer site.
EndUser: They would borrow the phone and hold it up to the phone and it would send the order in.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: There was no such thing as online. And then when we got bones and modems, you're able to put a modem, you click a modem on, you plug a modem into your laptop.
EndUser: And then you could then you could upload it while you didn't have to set there at the customer site.
EndUser: You could get in your car and while you're driving, you could just upload it while you're driving to the next place.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That's kind of where it all started and began. But much bigger programs. I do other stuff too. I do a lot of data maintenance. So I'm the one that keeps track of all the hierarchy, the customer hierarchy.
EndUser: And that would be really a nice way to quite frankly, the parent-child relationship as being the only hierarchy capability.
EndUser: Yeah. Unfortunately, instead of having a parent-child,
EndUser: Hierarchy relationship, it's now part of an account, right?
EndUser: So you go from account to sub account, right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But the problem, the problem with that is that you're having to make a blank account just to do that. It's like the account, the customer account doesn't exist.
EndUser: So I want to be able to say, you know, I want to be able to put all my, say, say [ORG-42]'s a big company, right?
EndUser: So worldwide, they're worldwide. But I want to be able to group them into certain groups because we have to then say that anything in [GPE-3] we have like is one group.
EndUser: Everything outside [GPE-3], depending on what country you're in, will be a different group. And we have to manage them separately.
EndUser: But it's all one big company, right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So in order to do the regional and then to roll it up to an alt, like a global parent, I actually have to create accounts and link them together through the account instead of being able to just have a parent-child relationship through them.
EndUser: I actually have to create accounts. So now... What people do is they go find, they can't find the one they want. So they grab one of the hierarchical accounts and then they start using it.
EndUser: So one of the things I have to do is go back in and undo that.
Agent: So it's sounding, here's the thing. One, unfortunately, we are short on time because I'm gonna miss my train if I don't to daddle here in [TIME-2].
EndUser: Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Agent: No, no, this has been fantastic. If anything, I'm pretty convinced that it would be beneficial, mutually beneficial.
Agent: If like we said some time, maybe to speak with someone who's a little more, technically capable than I am to speak with you about some of this stuff.
Agent: Is that something that you'd be open to or?
EndUser: Well, remember, well, I can tell you this, all the things that I'm. having trouble with I see in blogs. So I know I'm not the only one who's having trouble with some of this stuff.
EndUser: So I... You know, and quite honestly, it's always, it's some, most of the stuff that I'm having trouble with, everyone else is having trouble with is, as well.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: So I've just, it's just the stuff that we come across and we have to experience and, and because we're a little bit more complex than just straight, I can tell that too, because as people come in from other companies, they're like, oh, well, I was using [ORG-1].
EndUser: And it was like, okay, well, hold on a second. You were probably not using it the way we use it.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And they come in, they go, no, I know exactly what I'm doing. And they go in and they start trying to delete the accounts. And we're like, I can't delete this account. And I can't change this account.
EndUser: It's like, yes, because we have a non-standard, yeah.
Agent: Here's a gazillion reasons why. Yeah.
EndUser: We have a non-standard, you know, and we have any given reason why you can't delete or merge an account.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: We don't allow people. We don't allow users to have merge account. I'm one of the few, maybe one of two or three people that can merge an account.
Agent: That has like that super admin level access to, you know.
EndUser: And I don't even have admin access.
EndUser: I have like this, they created like an admin light, like a partial admin, right?
Agent: Huh.
EndUser: Like a, they tried to make it like a [ORG-35] admin.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Like we used to be able to have a [ORG-35] admin. But I can't go, I mean, I can't move around and ghost and things that way on most stuff.
EndUser: Because I'm not in IT, right?
EndUser: I just, I'm like a super user. I'm a super powerful user because I have an IT background.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And when we do testing,
Agent: And you understand the business needs. It's like you're you are blue wolf all by yourself.
EndUser: I'm like one of the people that go in the back end for testing.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So they want to know, they want to test this.
EndUser: Well, I start bringing up stuff that is like, well, how did you find that?
EndUser: It's like, well, I tested it. And they're like, well, you're the only one who reported it. And it's like, well, I know it's not in my area of expertise, but I'm certainly going to test it for that.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You know, so I'll let you run and then
Agent: Yeah, I'm sorry that I have to cut it short. I wish it was a great chat. Did you want to schedule more time or like, you know, do you have, you said your piece said, I'm not the.
EndUser: I Think most everything I need I would need to say is been said
Agent: Okay. Because I mean, you could really think of me as almost like a conduit to someone more knowledgeable with sales force to chat with you about things.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I know that, and you did say it was recorded, right?
EndUser: So you can go back and listen to all this stuff and just pick out what you need.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'm sure they're, you know, we'll have some sort of, you know, [ORG-33] integration, like probably no one will even listen to this. If anything, just the [PRODUCT-1] would listen to it and just maybe summarize.
Agent: Uh... you know important details keep points and you know we can review it that way uh... i was just curious if you had any interest in speaking with somebody else but if you don't that's totally fine
EndUser: Not really. I mean, not really. I mean, it's like I said, I'm really not an IT. And for anything that would be changed, I wouldn't be involved in it. But I would feel the benefit of it.
Agent: Well, that's why I'm asking, like, you know, if there's things that can be changed, you know, this could be, you know, potentially an opportunity to do that.
EndUser: Well, I think most of everything I'm complaining about has been complained about for [DATE-4]. So I don't think they're on the, you know, and there's reasons why they won't fix things necessarily.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: Because they're promoting other stuff, right?
EndUser: So if they went out and bought [PERSON-2] and they had Wave, they put a lot of money and development into reporting and analysis reporting.
EndUser: That takes a lot of clicks, right?
EndUser: You know, a lot of horsepower to run those.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So they're never going to put that into [ORG-1] proper.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Right. So I can see as far as marketing goes and as far as what would make sense in design. I mean, I understand that.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: [PERSON-9].
Agent: Well, I'm sorry that I have to go. This has been super informative.
Agent: And, you know, I might reach out again sometime if I want to pick the brain, just because I really appreciated just your candor and also being able to sort of get in the weeds with you on the technical side of things.
Agent: But I guess my one regret is I'm not personally able to offer you any solutions. But again, I don't have a technical background as you and I've been with the company for [DATE-21]. So that's really all.
Agent: Comes down to. If you ever do want to speak with somebody that really does sort of the solutions engineering side of things though. Please don't hesitate to reach out.
Agent: I can put you in touch with somebody like a D split.
EndUser: Yeah, I appreciate that.
Agent: All right, [PERSON-10]. Well, I hope you have a lovely.

EndUser: What was your name?
Agent: Oh, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: [PERSON-1], [PERSON-1].
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Sorry, I get a little space on names.
Agent: No, it's fine. I think I said, I said my name once [TIME-3]. So you are forgiven for not remembering that.
EndUser: Ok, [PERSON-11], I appreciate that.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's all good. I'm also terrible with names, especially when I when someone told me [TIME-4] and we haven't revisited it. You are forgiven, sir. Great, well, it's been an absolute pleasure.
EndUser: All right. We have [TIME-5].
Agent: Yeah, you too. Take care. Happy holidays.

Agent: Hello Hi, is this [PERSON-1]?
EndUser: This it is
Agent: Hi, [PERSON-2]. My name is Brely [PERSON-3] and I work on [ORG-4] here at [ORG-5].
Agent: Do you have a second to chat?
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: So I just am introducing myself because I am the newest member of our team here at [ORG-5] and I just kind of want to get a better sense of, you know, it looks like you've maybe done a [GPE-1] demo in the past, but you know, going into [DATE-2], I just kind of wanted a better sense of your software goals and needs.
EndUser: Have done a what demo?
Agent: It's a low demo. It's one of our products, [ORG-6].
EndUser: Not that I can remember, but I mean, you know, I mean I stay busy here, I mean I support like 72 people.
Agent: Ok, and what do you do in your data's a role supporting them?
EndUser: We have our custom applications that we develop in-house. And then there's a lot of little applications that we do want to side just for quick.
EndUser: Updates in case people need to do it so we do like power queries and stuff like that.
Agent: Got it. And so it's all like kind of in-house, like, you know, software, it's not.
EndUser: It's all in house. all in house development.
Agent: Oh, you're making my job.
EndUser: We use [ORG-7], we use [ORG-8] on the [ORG-9] side. I use [ORG-10], we use [PRODUCT-1], and whatever is...
Agent: Yeah, how is, um, how are those worried for you?
EndUser: Everything works fine.
Agent: Well, is there anything that you wish that, you know, a reviewer that would make your life easier that the system's like currently not doing?
EndUser: No i i wish but the only thing i wish is that they would have found web server
Agent: Yeah, and it's everything right now, but like on [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Well i mean everything is controlled by somebody else that's in sterling and then uh... you know they're really picky about that kind of stuff because then that's more they have to support and they don't want their job to to be any more than what it is now but I mean, no.
Agent: Yeah, no, I hear you on that. Um. You know, everyone has a lot of tasks like, you know, push for them.
Agent: Are you like, you know, I guess we're using like Power BI and like data queries, like are you, what kind of data are you gathering?
Agent: Is it mostly environmental or?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: No, it pertains to oil industry, everything that's done in the [LOC-1], all the drilling data and stuff like that. And, you know, we have like, you know,
EndUser: Accident investigations and, I mean, it's just the whole, I mean, I came from [ORG-8]. So, I mean, I thought there was a lot of data in the [ORG-14], but there's probably more data here.
Agent: Yeah, and no, I can imagine I feel like the federal government has so much data that you know it's really it's really hard to like you visualize that and put it all together so.
EndUser: Yeah, but the problem is like... all these third-party people want to use a Service Now <inaudible> you know and it's garbage because it's so so generic looking and and everything looks the same every application in Service Now i mean it just had a little flow to it looks like a basic web page
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean personally i think it's garbage
Agent: No, and you know, I obviously I'm biased, but I do think that we have a great product that can be very personalized and you know what people know actually [ORG-14] is one of our competitors and yeah, so we you know
EndUser: And let me tell you, let me guess, it runs on top of service now.
EndUser: You can't take, look, I was with [ORG-8] when they decided that they wanted to use, what is it, [ORG-14], what is it, [PRODUCT-2] is what it's called and they, you know, wanted to use that for our scouting system.
EndUser: And I'm like, You're trying to use a square peg to fit a round hole. You're trying to put a square peg in a round hole.
EndUser: And I'm like, you can't just apply this to anything and everything for what we do.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And they found out the hard way. So now I'm seeing this here with this [ORG-14] <inaudible>. And I'm like, this is. We're trying to fit a square peg in our own hole.
EndUser: Again, we're trying to mold something that's really not metral what we're doing. We're going to try to jam it in there. And, you know, I mean, I just, I've seen it. I demoed it. I just don't like it.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: Now, and I totally hear that, you know, I feel like, you know, it's definitely important to, you know, how you visualize interpret data can make, you know, reports and, you know, leadership make, you know, decisions.
Agent: So all that is very important and I guess what was really unique about [GPE-1] is that it's able to access real-time data and pull that into your system.
EndUser: No, I'm... I have not demoed [GPE-1], but I'm familiar with it. It's competitor to [ORG-14] and all that stuff.
Agent: And yeah, it also in [ORG-7] is probably...
EndUser: Well, you know what?
EndUser: You guys need to make it easier for developers to have access to get the experience on using it. I mean, as a programmer and a developer, I don't see why I should have to pay a ridiculous amount.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: To use your project.
EndUser: I mean, if I go to somebody, some big company, and I'm going to say, hey, I advise you guys to use [GPE-1] for this, and I'm going to use this to develop your project, why should I have to pay in [ORG-14] and Alleged?
EndUser: I mean, when they bought a license, then you can charge them in [ORG-14] and [ORG-17], but as a developer, I don't know.
EndUser: It just seems like these big companies, like you get to [GPE-1], and I'll just make it so difficult for the developer.
Agent: No, and I totally hear that.
Agent: I think you had to ask too, what is expensive?
Agent: So Power BI at [ORG-17] looks cheap, right?
Agent: Because it's all included with your other licenses. But the difference is that with [GPE-1], you're paying that upfront cross.
Agent: So you know what you're signing up for, and you're getting personalized dashboards that we have a support team that will help you create from the developer side. We also wear a platform partner company that we can work with.
Agent: You know, we do have our in-house, you know, Professional services team, but you know, I'll be up.
EndUser: I get that, but if you have good documentation, which most people don't, then I don't need that.
EndUser: I mean, that's fine for the customer after the fact, once I develop the application and give it off to them, if they want to call you guys, you know, for support and all of that, then they can.
EndUser: But as a developer, if you have good documentation, I don't need to support team unless it's something that's really maybe heavy duty or something like that. Like [ORG-14], for example.
EndUser: If I want to learn SQL Server, there's a full blown version of [ORG-14] SQL Server out there. I can [DATE-3] go download from [ORG-14] and have all the features.
EndUser: As a developer because it's a development version if i had paid for it but now if i if i you know give that to another company then of course they have to buy licenses and they pay for it and that's fine and great and dandy and i don't know why everybody doesn't just do that
Agent: No, and I, you know, we do. So I think how our like how we're kind of structured is there's, you know, different, there's like the creator license.
Agent: So that's like the person that's like actually creating the dashboard and that's like pulling in that data and you know, that'd be what I'm assuming you would be.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: And then we also just have viewer licenses.
Agent: So it's like once that dashboards like felt out, like if you just want someone to have access to view it but not edit it, that's its own like that's quoted totally differently.
Agent: So that It does help make the price a little bit more manageable because it's not every single person needs to have that development tool.
Agent: What I will say about our competitor [ORG-14] is that when that data gets put into [PRODUCT-3], unless you really love that table function and building out this formula, it can get stuck there.
Agent: And the visualization that you have is pretty limited to the grass and services that they have in there.
Agent: It's not it's a little bit harder to personalize and then with power BI like you're continuing to add on cost You know as you as you sign in and often to all those different functions So that's where it's a little bit different with [GPE-1] is like we have a team that like Have a discussion with you learn about your personal needs and pain points and then kind of help create like a personalized solution that you know You can build out further and usually when people are like seeing these dashboards They find that you know the access to having real-time data at your fingertips that can refresh at any point is, you know, can be very influential.
EndUser: Well, that's where replication is for [ORG-14] and [ORG-9].
Agent: Yeah, you know, I do hear that.
Agent: You know, we get a lot of these, these pushbacks often, honestly, and to be totally frank, I've had a hard time getting anyone at [PERSON-5] because you guys seem pretty satisfied with your product.
Agent: So I do, I do totally understand that, but If you would be open to it, I would love to just set up a quick call with my [GPE-1] team to see how we do compare and maybe you can tell me to pound sand, but we'd love to just see if there's anything that we can maybe help your make your life a little easier.
EndUser: Bye.
EndUser: Well, I mean, [ORG-8] is free. It's from [ORG-9]. We use our databases, [ORG-9], although we do use SQL Server 2. And I mean, [ORG-8], we're able to pick that up on our own. I mean, look, I get it.
EndUser: I get you guys in business for money.
EndUser: Ok?
EndUser: But you kind of understand how the government works is do you know what we have to go through to get a purchase order approved?
Agent: And.
EndUser: I mean it's a long process.
Agent: Oh yeah, no, it's the whole.
EndUser: I mean for me just to get non-core software installed on my machine I got to jump through hoops.
Agent: Definitely.
EndUser: Okay and it's ridiculous right look I come from the outside world. This is my first job in the government.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And I mean, I'm like, you know, I'm waiting [DATE-4] on something that when I was working with the [ORG-14], I had done it in [TIME-2].
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, it's just the way it works.
Agent: Oh, I. Definitely can relate.
EndUser: But I mean, you know, you get in the business of making money. I have nothing against that. But. You.
EndUser: You really need to rethink how you do things for developers. I know I get it you guys want to develop it and all that stuff because you charge $[MONEY-1] an hour.
EndUser: I mean nothing against that if somebody wants to pay that.
Agent: No, and like, what I was going to say, which upload is it is different.
Agent: Like all of our, I would say sales for [PERCENT-1] of our products are like low to no code, like out of the box relative solutions.
EndUser: So, I know, but say me as a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm, look, I took assembly language.
Agent: You're the guy pretty of that. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I took all of that stuff, assembly language, Code and cobalt, [WORK_OF_ART-1], dot net, C sharp, all of that stuff.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: More languages than me, for sure.
EndUser: And then, and then I do SQL coding too. So, um, You know, but somebody like me if I'm you know want to learn every part of [GPE-1] That's not possible.
EndUser: It's not probably not because I can't learn it It's not possible because the way that you guys have struck for software
Agent: You know, to be honest, I haven't really had that pushback before. So, you know, it is interesting kind of think about, but what I would say is,
EndUser: I Mean we're gonna do give me a [DATE-5] free trial.
EndUser: What the hell can I learn in [DATE-6]?
EndUser: I mean, it's...
Agent: Yeah, no, but there. So there is a huge like user base of like, like if you want, like if you have [ORG-18], like right, everything or definitely [PERSON-6] is a great person.
EndUser: No, I know.
Agent: Like he's, we have all, we actually do have training courses.
Agent: So like if you want to learn about mapping or you want to learn about, tracking functions, like, you know, whatever, like, we do have courses on that are all free.
Agent: With that said, you can definitely pay for like, you know, for a program too.
EndUser: You mean it's not... it's not... It's not $[MONEY-2] class. I mean, that's what it's.
Agent: No, it is not. So, so what I was going to say is if you want to pay for the [GPE-1] training at the $[MONEY-3] per user per year. So, that it's pretty affordable.
Agent: So that is like, but what I'm saying is most users don't even need to do that because we do have such a great like if you go to trail maps right now, like [FAC-1] map like [ORG-22] it.
Agent: It like you can like see all of our free training that we have if you want like certification.
Agent: I think that they Like I think it's like [MONEY-4] or something to like take the certification test, but it's only if you want that like certification for your resume or whatever purposes.
EndUser: Okay, this is what I will do. This is what I will do. You email me your contact information.
EndUser: And what I will do, since I'm bored to <inaudible> on [DATE-7] and in the evenings, I will start looking at [ORG-18] videos and learn what I can on [GPE-1].
EndUser: I hope you guys all have like 17 different packages or something like that at you.
Agent: No, no, I'll send you some links that I think would be helpful.
EndUser: You know.
Agent: But to be honest, [PERSON-2], I really think it would be helpful. Just [PERSON-7], give a call with my, my, because he'll be able to tell you, like, if you're in, he's a very blunt guy.
Agent: Like, if you guys have everything covered with [ORG-8] and Power BI, like, we'll be, like, I don't want to waste your time. I don't want to waste my own time. I don't want to waste your time.
Agent: I really think it could be beneficial for, because I'm not the [GPE-1] expert. I'm really just like the hunter-gatherer information of like trying to make our solution better. Like I actually cannot tell you something to myself.
EndUser: The headhunter, huh?
EndUser: Looking for people.
Agent: Yeah, you know, it's something like that, right?
EndUser: To make the six figures on.
Agent: But yeah, I'm not the Tableau Bexford by any means. I'm more of like scary on the right direction expert. So you know, and but I'll send you some links. I do think.
Agent: You would honestly save more of your time if we set up a quick like [TIME-3] call with my account executive, but I do, you know, if you want to look at those links first, I understand that completely and definitely, you know, instead of your time.
EndUser: Yeah, no, I sure do. I sure do. I definitely, you know, because I mean, I'm not going to go to anybody in management and recommend something without me knowing what the hell I'm talking about.
EndUser: I'm not going to do that.
Agent: Yeah, that's where we would have just honestly discovery call and we would ask you, hey, what are your top-hand points?
EndUser: So, you know,
Agent: What do you do with your data analytics?
Agent: What have you built out with those tools?
Agent: And then we would probably just try to tell you how we can do it better. But it would totally be just a friendly kind of discovery call, not anything like.
Agent: Where you would need any of the decision makers in the room by any means.
EndUser: And, I mean, how do you handle your area and somebody else?
EndUser: I would say, well, how do you guys?
EndUser: Handle replication within [GPE-1].
EndUser: Like is that something that needs to be configured?
EndUser: Or do you just, you know, like have to go through 55 steps to build an N or what, you know?
EndUser: Because we, you know, a lot of our applications here, we have inspectors. They're not always in the office. They will go to a platform. So they don't always have internet connectivity.
EndUser: So and they still have to be able to do their job, even though they don't have connectivity.
Agent: Oh yeah.
EndUser: So of course there's a thinking of data, okay?
Agent: Definitely.
EndUser: And so that's where replication comes in.
EndUser: Replication basically, you know, the database, a table in your database on your laptop goes to the server and says, hey, what data do you have that I don't have?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Oh, okay, update me and vice versa. Okay, so I mean, and you know, normally you would build replication into a database. But, I mean, you guys, I'm sure, I don't know, well, I'm sure.
Agent: So,
EndUser: What do you all use as a database?
EndUser: What does [GPE-1] sit on top of?
EndUser: What does it use as a database?
EndUser: I mean, unless you've got your own proprietary database, I mean,
Agent: Well, so that's kind of thing. So we can, so that, you know how I mentioned we're a partner company. So we can really integrate into whatever, like, whatever database or. you know, data set that you're using.
Agent: So I know that we already are set up to integrate with [ORG-9], for example.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: So like if that's the database that you're using, like. that that's already created.
Agent: And then like we can also, if let's say you had a different database that we didn't have that set up with, we would then, like we could also like, that would be a little bit harder to do, but like there would, like we can integrate with any database is that's kind of the whole benefit of [GPE-1].
Agent: And to your point of like real-time data and like getting access, I know that we've worked with. So we do have very high Security parameters and.
Agent: We've worked with the [ORG-17], for example, and on some of their ships, we found that they don't have access to the internet at all times. They're like a cloud-based solution. That data can be delayed or whatever.
Agent: And to be honest, this will definitely be more up my account executives alley, but I don't because I don't fully understand the technical side of how the solution worked.
Agent: But we were able to create where they, I believe, had within [TIME-4] could access the data, even if they were offline.
Agent: So you had kind of that window and then hopefully you'd be in access to a Wi-Fi unit after that point.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah.
Agent: So there are, and this has been something that I cover all of the [ORG-22]. So this is something that I've talked to very actively with [ORG-30].
EndUser: So you cover everybody in [ORG-22], so like wildlife and fish, [ORG-18].
Agent: Yeah, if we're talking to all your friends. Yeah, so [ORG-17] is probably where we have the most install for within the [GPE-2]
Agent: [PERSON-8], I also help cover [ORG-22], so they're one of our really big customers as well.
Agent: So there has been like a good amount of adoption, but you know I told you best needs been a little hard to get, so that's why I'm very happy that you took my call [DATE-3].
EndUser: Well, I'm talking to you, but until I get up to speed on [GPE-1], okay, and I see, all right, well first off, what can I do?
EndUser: All right, number two is me being acquainted with it.
EndUser: Okay?
EndUser: Me hands on being able to work with it without me having to pay $[MONEY-5] licensee for this part of [GPE-1]. Another $[MONEY-5] for this part of [GPE-1]. And you know, where I can like do No, okay, so.
Agent: You're talking about our friends at [ORG-7], sir. That is, that's what I'm telling you. That's the benefit of [GPE-1] is, you know, we tell you like what that total cost is kind of upfront.
Agent: Like sure, he want to pay for training and other things later on. That's you, but upfront, like we, there's not all these add-ons, like they do.
EndUser: Yeah, if you guys would do that for the developers, make it basically where we learn and master your software, then we can recommend it. Number two, we can push it to customers for you.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, you got a built-in sales force then, okay?
EndUser: Of experienced people that are going to recommend your product, and then they're going to build a nice big application using your product that you then are going to sell licensing fees on and support and all of that stuff.
EndUser: So really, you guys should welcome us as developers.
Agent: No, you want to.
EndUser: We rolling out the red carpet for you, man, look, what do you need?
Agent: I can't.
EndUser: All the training you want, we want you to know everything about [GPE-1], so you can push us.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah. And no, and it's honestly, that is our goal. Like, um, that's, we do want, like, so sales were required to have low, um, because it was the world's leading analytical solution for all data.
Agent: So like, for all data sets with all the, any database you can connect to, like, [GPE-1] is the leading, both on the commercial and public sector side. And so I think really if you could.
Agent: See some examples of what we've been able to do with these dashboards, it could almost sell itself because I'm coming from a finance background.
Agent: I was [ORG-14] through and through, it's actually taking some time to get used to [ORG-22] and some of our systems.
Agent: But what I will say is anything, I used to build a lot of reports and the type of data that you can actually turn into real-time, these electronic sources will bring into their games contact, might be able to, whether even they'll reach the end of the process and further their bonds.
Agent: So, the [ORG-30] change will give remails and Fighting to draw assets to support non-private finance and activetes into your network.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: That honestly is worth the upfront cost because if you can't actionize your data, then what's the point of putting it all together?
Agent: If you're providing much reports and not doing anything with it, that's not what we want to see. We want you to be able to make that data actionable and push it to those decision makers and those customers.
Agent: You know, make and help push like besties.
Agent: Initiatives, you know, like we want like I definitely would love to see a safer safer and more environmentally safe like world so Anything that we can kind of do to help that mission and you know the data behind it is like that's what i'm here for
EndUser: And that's fine like i said if i get up to speed with [GPE-1] i don't mind pushing you guys and then you'll have somebody to push you in there with the power bi and the apex people you know
Agent: Yeah And I know and I agree, but I think I really do think it would be helpful.
Agent: Like if you had a conversation with [PERSON-9], like it sounds like you know exactly what you're talking about and he's been working with the public sector for [DATE-8], you know.
Agent: So he definitely knows what he's talking about on the [GPE-1] side and I don't think sending those materials.
Agent: But I do think like a quick like if you had time like [DATE-9] or next like a quick, you know, [TIME-3] call like could really go wonders.
Agent: And then, you know, if you, If you don't want to move forward after that, that's totally fine. But I think he could kind of help answer a lot of these questions too.
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean It would probably have to wait till when I come back from vacation. I have [QUANTITY-1] that I have to take. Buddy into [DATE-10].
Agent: Nice, where are you going?
EndUser: I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to. I don't look right now. This new thing with this [GPE-3] stuff going around again. I'm like, man, you know, it never used to be like this.
Agent: [LOC-2] view.
EndUser: It never used to be like this. This is crazy times where, you know, I mean, there's so many things now out there that I would. You know, I I don't know.
EndUser: I mean, I would love to take a cruise.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I would love to go somewhere But you know what it's just nowadays You get sick you could <inaudible> and it's like you know, while You know when this COVID stuff came along.
Agent: Now it is scary.
EndUser: I mean, you know <inaudible> over a million people, you know, I mean And so what I mean I'm just going to just relax and take some time off.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It's [DATE-8]. I've been working [DATE-14]. And the guys I support, they'll be taking time off. So that's why I'm taking my time off.
EndUser: And so I'm just going to relax and get myself a brain break. And then come back to [DATE-14]. So it's probably would not.
EndUser: It'd be best to get in touch with me after [DATE-14]. Because I'm going to be leaving.
Agent: Okay, yeah, I can definitely do that.
EndUser: And I'll be looking at some [LAW-1] videos.
EndUser: And I'll go to your website and see, OK, what's soft?
EndUser: All right, how many components are soft?
EndUser: Are there with [GPE-1]?
EndUser: Is there 45?
EndUser: A hundred or what?
EndUser: I mean, is there [GPE-1]?
EndUser: Then is there [GPE-1]?
EndUser: Light, [GPE-1]?
EndUser: Premier, [GPE-1]?
EndUser: Heavy duty, whatever. I mean, all of that stuff. And that's another thing is that sometimes software vendors, they make it so.
EndUser: Many different ways and it's like okay so if I want to do thi s now i gotta get that package and that's [MONEY-6] you know i mean
Agent: Yeah, no, and I promise you, it really is not like that. It is truly a role-based licensing and pivot system. So it's kind of broken up between like there's, there's three licenses that you'll get.
Agent: And then so like, you know, how that discussion would enter now is like, you know, after you meet with [PERSON-9], like an other team, you know, we'd kind of help figure out what that sizing look like.
Agent: And if it's, you know, if you're the main, you know, architecture, like, you know, you definitely have a creator's license or if there's other. to figure out how many of those licenses, those are definitely the more expensive licenses.
Agent: But then like viewer and then there's like another license that's kind of a combo though, where you have some editing permissions, but not all permissions.
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm.
Agent: So that's kind of like, I also covered [ORG-23] and the course, for example, you know, they have like researchers that are putting together all this data and visualizations and then they're going to like the clerks and the judges and like they only have those viewing license to like, you know, access the data but not edit or manipulate it.
Agent: So it's really those three role-based breakdown and then like figuring out like what the team needs.
EndUser: Wow. So who does, I mean, I'm thinking,
Agent: I promise I'm trying to make your life easier here, [PERSON-2].
EndUser: I've been writing [LAW-2] [DATE-14]. I mean, a long time.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, but, so what you, from what you just told me then, let's, let's say, I need to get down to the nitty gritty level, then you have to have that license and you've had to purchase that, right?
Agent: Um, so well.
EndUser: Or do I, am I supposed to then call you guys and say, hey, I'm looking to do this and you go, we developed that for you.
EndUser: You know, and I mean, then your inside people develop it at a certain cost.
Agent: Can you give me examples of something like that?
EndUser: Um, I don't know, let's just say for example, um,
EndUser: I want to query all the platforms that are in [LOC-3] that are producing more than, I don't know, [QUANTITY-2] of oil a day.
Agent: Yeah, okay, so. Definitely. So I guess like...
EndUser: You know, let's say before I was only, you know, I had something in there to where I I did some of it, but before I just had something that built it, it gave me all the platforms that were in the [LOC-1].
EndUser: Now I want to filter some more. I want to say, not only do I want all the platforms in [LOC-3], I want all the platforms that are producing $[MONEY-7] barrels [DATE-14].
EndUser: And also I want to know...
EndUser: You know, in addition to [QUANTITY-3] a day if they were inspected within [DATE-14]. You know, I mean, you know, so now I want to change.
Agent: Yes, yeah, it can do all that in.
EndUser: I want to make a change. I had something to implement it before to where I was getting all the platforms and the golf.
EndUser: But now I want to make a change to my previous query or whatever, let's call it, you know, my low code, no code widget to where I'm looking for [QUANTITY-2] a day and also, you know, if they were inspected within [DATE-14].
EndUser: Am I allowed to make those changes or do I need a, you know, Yeah, [PERCENT-2].
Agent: Yeah, so those will all be like filters, that little toggles essentially, that you would just change. And
Agent: So if we have something that, how would the demo would kind of work, is like, honestly, you would tell us in the discovery call, like, a good example like that, right?
Agent: My solution engineer would apply that to one of our demos, like something that we've built for somewhere else in GUI or another territory.
Agent: And then like show you, if it's mapping, like if you want to see where all of those different, those rigs are, it could show you on a map where those are.
Agent: If you want to see, and also if you wanted a dot that's based off of the size of how much barrels of oil were being pulled, like.
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Agent: That size of that dot can be larger or smaller so you can see you know where the most oil is coming from.
Agent: If you then wanted to connect it to data that's looking at like village or pollution or you have that data, that's what's great about [GPE-1]. It can connect from all of those different data sets.
Agent: So like if that oil barrel production was in one data set and pollution was making the celebrate, pollution was another data set that could bring that together into [GPE-1] in one single place.
EndUser: So, do you guys,
Agent: So our whole idea is to be like a single streamline source truth. Like that's our whole goal.
EndUser: So you said you do work with [ORG-28]?
Agent: Yeah, we're working very we were very close to [ORG-28].
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: So like, have you heard of like their [ORG-26], like the [GPE-4] land?
Agent: It's like their Integration system.
EndUser: No, but they're very similar to us, except they do one shore. We do all shore.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Okay, so that's the difference between [ORG-18] and its [ORG-36] land management. So everything they do is dealing with resources that are on land. You know, could be gold, could be silver, could be oil.
EndUser: You know, any resource that's on land is [ORG-18].
Agent: Yeah. Yep.
EndUser: Where as we deal strictly with oil, gas, everything that's in the federal wars, like [LOC-3], [GPE-5] or [GPE-6].
EndUser: And now you're going to have a new area also now to go into which is renewable energy, like wind farms.
Agent: Okay, so. Yeah, that's a very exciting. Nice.
EndUser: I mean, I have two applications. I have two applications that are in my head, okay, right now that if I had the right to and implemented it, could charge a nice, [MONEY-8] for these applications.
EndUser: I mean, just, I developed this.
Agent: What are those applications?
EndUser: Okay, I worked for [ORG-8] and I was the database and the programmer guy. So I developed a whole scaling system for them while I was there.
EndUser: And then I came up with some ideas and I happened to mention it when we were at [ORG-14] and my boss [PERSON-10] was along with somebody from [ORG-14], still my intellectual IDs and they were looking to hire developers and programmers from [GPE-7] to try to implement my idea.
Agent: I'm sitting [DATE-17]. I'm sitting next to [DATE-17]. I'll go on mute.
EndUser: So anyway, that idea is still there.
EndUser: So I could see to where maybe [GPE-1] could be involved in it. That's one application right there.
EndUser: And then so I could think of a whole scouting system to develop using [GPE-1] that could be pushed all the [ORG-14] teams.
Agent: I'm going to look forward it.
EndUser: Okay. That's one application.
Agent: This is just like here.
EndUser: Now another application would be in our area kind of.
Agent: I'm going
EndUser: I mean, I haven't gotten everything pieced together yet.
Agent: To tell you so.
EndUser: In fact, I was looking at, I don't know if you're familiar with ArcGIS.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: It's a program that's used for GIS information. So like you were talking about the mapping and all that stuff, the three-dimensional mapping.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And I was looking at how to embed that into a .NET application.
Agent: Hello. Before nice to meet you. I'll show you my last.
EndUser: So I have a couple of ideas.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Like I said, if I can get up to speed on your software, I think I can push it.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. I do think that. After all the information that you've given me in [TIME-5] or so, I really, really think that you could benefit from my colleague, [PERSON-9], but I.
EndUser: You know, normally I do not take these calls. I'm like it is because normally I say, look, I'm in the middle of writing code.
Agent: Let's put my lucky day then.
EndUser: I really don't have time for this. And, but [DATE-3] is kind of [DATE-14]. And so, yeah, I, I.
Agent: Yeah. Well, [PERSON-2], I would love to get your opinion on right now. Like, [PERSON-8], if you're in front of your figure five, obviously, no worries.
Agent: But if you, if you type an [ORG-26], that [ORG-28], [ORG-26]. [ORG-5] built all of that for them. And so what that is Mineral and land record system mls and so And
EndUser: Blm with the name of the system.
EndUser: All right. I see it at home.
Agent: So So
EndUser: Blm ML or us.
Agent: We built we built this for them and this is all of our software here, so Yes.
EndUser: So your developers developed it.
Agent: To be honest, so I just started in [DATE-18]. I wasn't here when this program went into place.
EndUser: Uh-huh.
Agent: But so typically, so that's what I was saying earlier, we have our Professional services team, but to be honest, they're expensive.
EndUser: Uh-huh.
Agent: So a lot of times people will use who they're already using for [PRODUCT-4], I guess.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So like, if that's essential, if that's whoever you're working with, we can partner with.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: We do have our own developers that can do that too. that being said, most of our Code solutions try to be low no code.
Agent: So then the in-house developing team, people like yourself, can just can do it almost seamlessly without having to like making personalization.
Agent: If you want something more personalized like less out of the box, then that would be like built through [ORG-5].
Agent: So like I think this for example was a little bit more of like a hands-on like, you know, in-depth like project that we did with [ORG-18], but this was a huge project when it happened and like something that we are like, you know, we still like are talking and working with them.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: So to keep making better, but this is just like I thought one example that you could see like the scope of something that we could build.
Agent: This was mostly using our Integration tool mule soft, but it also has like some other like [GPE-1] and other analytics and core products as well in there too. So this is kind of like a big upheaval project.
Agent: And it just kind of like, I guess I would just need more information on like the scope of projects that you know you'd be looking at like doing potentially with [GPE-1], you know, if it is like you know set like dashboards and all that's a little bit smaller so you tell those typically a good one of our products to kind of start with.
Agent: And then, you know, if you were already using like our CRM system, like that would be, like then it's obviously easier to like have all the, like the different other products added.
Agent: But typically, you know, [GPE-1] is a good way to like start, like, see, you know, and like get tried the demo, see if it's something that could like be influential to you and your team.
Agent: Um, and it's not, you know, then there's, there's, you know, no time or, you know, cures, lost.
Agent: But I do think a lot of those pain points that you're talking about are like out on cost, that all these things, like that's not that you're not going to experience with us.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: So, who's the person to talk to about the training that you have, you guys offer for say a developer like me?
EndUser: That wants to get up to speed on your software and maybe even become certified or whatever.
EndUser: If you could send me that information and let me talk to them to see if I could pass that on to my boss here to see if they would approve it.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Then I could start to dig in and then from there, I could say, hey man, look what this can do.
EndUser: Do and then if I'm able to develop things and show them, you know, so that they can go wow, that's cool, you know, I mean then, that' s Yeah.
Agent: So that's why I was going to say if we talk to [PERSON-9], he could potentially get you that demo like ahead of time.
EndUser: That's fine.
Agent: Then you could like actually like right now I'm going to excuse me, you know, I'm going to send you an email with my information and then like a bunch of like links that we talked about with like training and those things.
Agent: But in terms of like, I can't give you like as I said, like I'm not in the field. So like I can't like give you a demo myself. Like that would have to like come from. Yeah. So.
Agent: Also with like those links, but those are just going to be like kind of like broad examples.
Agent: If you wanted to get your hands on the software and like mess around with yourself, I really would love for you to talk to [PERSON-9], but I understand you've got vacation and the holidays and stuff too.
EndUser: Yeah, I kind of been looking forward to this just to take a brain break. But I will be back in [DATE-22].
EndUser: And then from there, like I said, whoever I need to talk to, to get up to speed with using this and developing some of my own demos using the data that we have here, then that's the thing [GPE-8] is believing.
EndUser: So, and then not only that, since I do work for the government, and if I jump anywhere, it might be, you know.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: The department like [ORG-18] or you know [GPE-9] or whatever then like I said it' s beneficial for you guys because then you have somebody that's a table t representative like me that no matter where I go I push I'm pushing yo u so uh... i mean i mean i'm almost like a salesperson that you don't have to pay even i'm like you know if i go to the old deal and hey man you guys know about how you see what it can do this is what i did when i was with bestie or if i go to the via hey look this is you know [GPE-1] and i mean and Yeah.
Agent: Now trust me, that's like in other areas. That's what that's the way that we make moves.
Agent: Yeah, like, yeah, like, yeah, like, who would best, like, are there people, like, are you guys like really happy with the solution, like, who should I be talking to, like, how kind of make your guys life easier, like, is, like, you know, is it, is it kind of like at this, like, you know, architect developer level?
EndUser: I where will look this is the deal
EndUser: Now I'm one of the people.
Agent: Yeah, like, so, yeah.
EndUser: No, I mean, I'm one of
EndUser: The people. We have three or four people here.
Agent: Okay, that's good to know.
EndUser: And so really, that's not true.
Agent: Because I know you guys are [ORG-14] shop, I was told that on [DATE-17], but you know I'd love to change your mind.
EndUser: That is not true.
Agent: You're not okay.
EndUser: No, we're, if anything, we are an [ORG-9] shop.
Agent: So.
EndUser: Okay?
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: You got to remember when you're dealing with government, you're going to be dealing with like even here at [ORG-39], some of our data servers are [ORG-14], some of our data servers are [ORG-9].
Agent: Come on. Yeah.
EndUser: Okay?
EndUser: So, you know, same thing with the low code, no code stuff. There's Power BI and then there's Apex. Okay, well we use [ORG-45].
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: We use [ORG-7] for [ORG-14]. Okay, so.
Agent: Yeah. And that's, yeah.
Agent: And when I hear that, honestly, I, like, that's music to my ears, because I thought it would be easier if, oh, that was in one place, right?
