Agent: I'm not a. I should probably get a team's license. I have. I don't have one either. I don't even. I don't know if we do team's licenses. I don't know.
Agent: Really?
Agent: Okay. I bet there's some sort of classierish something that we can use the client, but I don't know if you can set up meetings with it, unfortunately.
Agent: I think. I don't know if you saw it, but I'm back.
EndUser: I crashed right when I was sharing my screen. I heard you're talking about Teams license and I like the new there's a new teams client that just came out that uses vastly less resources, which is kind of nice.
EndUser: Maybe zoom needs to do the same thing, but I just I'm closing like everything except. Except zoom and one window for sharing so. Maybe that'll.
Agent: Awesome, thank you.
EndUser: I'll try it again. So if I crash out, it's good to share.
Agent: Yeah, there we go. Perfect. Dance. Awesome. So [PERSON-1], I'm open here. We can help drive the conversation, but it could also be helpful based on your comfort with Marketing Cloud.
Agent: Just walk us through, start with data, dive into kind of like day-to-day.
Agent: How do you use Marketing Cloud?
Agent: What areas do you think are really used really optimally?
Agent: Where do you think maybe are some gaps?
Agent: And we'll ask some questions along the way.
EndUser: So that's good.
EndUser: Can you still hear me?
EndUser: Yeah. You have crashed again. OK. Yeah, so well, if you don't mind, I would like to have a little bit of an outseeing it quite again.
Agent: You still hear me?
Agent: Okay. I think you might be frozen.
EndUser: All right. I'm back again. Back.
Agent: I wonder if [PERSON-1], if maybe you should send me a team's invite.
Agent: Sure. I wonder if that
Agent: Is a better path.
Agent: And then [PERSON-3], you could just forward it to us. So [PERSON-1], you don't have to worry about adding all of us. That might be better for bandwidth and everything.
EndUser: Yeah, let me do that.
Agent: Awesome, I just threw my email in the chat. It's Emily.ritter.salesforce.com.
EndUser: All right, I'll drop off this and I'll hop on even when one sits at. Perfect. It's really odd. I've never had problems before. Hopefully, teams will solve it. I'll forward it around. Thank you for doing that.
EndUser: Apologies about that. Yeah, here's the, oops, that's not it. Let me see if I can open the Teams meeting at the same time and then get blank.
EndUser: Okay, there's the link. So I'm going to [ORG-2] that to the group. Okay, I'll see you there. Thank you.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer:

The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs when discussing the use of Marketing Cloud. The rep asked some questions about the customer's experience with Marketing Cloud, such as how they use it, what areas are optimized, and where there might be gaps. However, the customer's responses were cut off due to technical issues, and the rep did not follow up to ensure they fully understood the customer's needs and pain points. Additionally, the rep could have asked more specific questions about the customer's current challenges, goals, and desired outcomes with Marketing Cloud.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales representative asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. The questions were:

1. ""How do you use Marketing Cloud?""
2. ""What areas do you think are really used really optimally?""
3. ""Where do you think maybe are some gaps?""

These questions aim to understand the customer's current usage, strengths, and weaknesses of their existing system, which can help the sales representative tailor their pitch to address the customer's needs and pain points."
