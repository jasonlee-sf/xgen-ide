video_14190_167_6qr3y000000ocIpAAI,"Agent: Perfect.
Agent: But yeah, [PERSON-1], what are your thoughts on that so far?
Agent: Is that kind of making sense in deviancy?
Agent: But it makes sense.
EndUser: Can you?
EndUser: Would you mind making one?
Agent: Sure. Yeah, so a couple of different ways to make one.
Agent: Let's just say, for example, let's go into your accounts, right?
Agent: Now again, these accounts that you're seeing here, as you guys start to kind of create accounts or even just taking your [PRODUCT-1] sheets and importing that into [ORG-1], you can add your accounts created.
Agent: So let's go ahead and go into [ORG-2]. [PERSON-1], before I create one, let me go ahead and just give you an overview of what you're seeing here just so you know how to navigate this.
Agent: Again, it could be configured a little bit differently. It just kind of depends on how you guys have your setup.
Agent: But for the most part, it should be a general way to kind of how to create specific or look for specific information. With these different fields right here, sometimes you'll have relevant information as far as their address.
Agent: You know, what type of account this is, and you can see here that they're a current customer, and also the account name along with relevant information. That way it's all in one page.
Agent: And on the right hand side is going to track your activities.
Agent: Now [PERSON-1], as far as just kind of creating an opportunity, right?
Agent: Say you're working with this group, you identify an opportunity.
Agent: You actually just going to, there's a couple of different ways, but one of the easiest ways usually right here, on the top right, we'll see a hot key button that says new opportunity, or you can usually click down and sometimes they'll be added here as well.
Agent: So let's go ahead and click to new opportunity. What's going to pop up in your end is going to be configured differently.
Agent: But however, this is just kind of a general standpoint, you'll have a couple different fields here that you can complete, right?
Agent: So for example, anything that might be relevant for charge through specifically will be right here.
Agent: But for the most part, you'll have an opportunity name, the amount of whatever you think that opportunity is going to land at a specific close date.
Agent: Sometimes, for example, if it's a quicker sales cycle for us specifically, maybe it's like a [DATE-1] sales sale cycle, other times it might be like [DATE-2] days out .
Agent: The reason that's important is because as you guys create opportunities, this feeds up into the data for [PERSON-2] and everybody else to be able to kind of track how much revenue and how much these opportunities are going to be.
Agent: For forecasting purposes, if that makes sense. And then of course the different stages as well, hey, are you prospecting, qualification discovery, all dependent on which our truth has for that self-process.
Agent: Yeah, [PERSON-3], do you mind if I jump in real So a few things here.
Agent: Quick?
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: So what [PERSON-3] is showing is this screen right here can be completely configurable. This, their opportunity page obviously will probably capture more details than just four fields.
Agent: So that bare minimum, like what needs to be filled out in order for an opportunity exists.
Agent: Those required fields, like we could configure it so that that that form is is basically capturing a necessary field before creating an opportunity.
Agent: But another thing I want to point out is If you import your data from your spreadsheet and you have your accounts existing, yes, you could create an opportunity this way.
Agent: But if you have, at least from a sales perspective, if you have like a lead qualification process, we could create leads and have them automatically convert to opportunities once the leads are qualified.
Agent: And then I know we're talking specifically about account management. So once you have your accounts, you have a few opportunities that are established, maybe they're closed down. out.
Agent: I'm making some assumptions here so please feel free to correct me if I' m talking about some of the wrong processes but from an account managemen t perspective once you have closed out opportunities potentially you migh t have a customer that needs to go through like a renewal process or needs to amen d something on the opportunity so we could on the account itself there' s different automations that could be set up so that the information get s automatically pulled from like a old opportunity so you're not [ORG-3] y re-kaying some of this stuf f. But just wanted to just talk through some of the different ways that opportunities can be create d, what [PERSON-3] is showing is just one way of [GPE-1] ng a net-new [PRODUCT-2], but there's definitely different ways f or opportunities to get create d. So I wanted to just lay that out there and ask the question s. When it comes to the account management team a nd dealing with opportunities, what does that look lik e?
EndUser: Really, we're not going to touch. I don't think we're going to touch a whole lot of it. It's possible that we'll create the opportunities that need to feed you after the sales time.
EndUser: So there's, we're as hey, there's up here's a situation where we can go. We can maybe do an upsell, maybe, you know, repositioning a unit, something like that. So there's not.
EndUser: So that's what we need to think about those opportunities to pitch up to the account manager, the actual account, the sales team to handle that.
Agent: Okay, so that's really more of sounds responsibility and commitment is.
EndUser: Like that's really more sales Yeah, okay. Yeah, I don't think we're going to be doing a whole lot of prospecting as part of our role. So just give me more and post
Agent: Close. Okay, will they ever have to refer to a potential opportunity or is it really more like the account information and keep in mind the like the involvement
EndUser: Opportunities typically to account. Yeah. Yeah, it's to be your clothes. Right. Yeah.
Agent: Yeah. Okay. That's good to know.
Agent: Sorry, [PERSON-3]. Just a little bit. That was great. No, thanks for bringing that up.
Agent: And again, [PERSON-2], since it seems like this would be more along the lines of the cross-selling up cell opportunities, that's what you guys have in your back pocket as well.
Agent: So as [PERSON-1] does a great job of account managing, maybe identifies as opportunities. You can easily create that great visibility for [PERSON-4] and the rest of the sales team.
Agent: Maybe [PERSON-5] can go in, start closing the deal, and start working that as well too. Maybe he's the assigned account executive to that account. And him and [PERSON-1] can tag team. potential uplift for charge fees .
Agent: Cool, so, [PERSON-1], do you want me to kind of continue going through this opportunity?
Agent: The other word, is that You can continue on.
EndUser: All making sense?
EndUser: That makes sense.
Agent: So once you guys create that, of course, you'll have the opportunities, but this is where it starts to become really powerful.
Agent: And really a lot of this is essentially just kind of like once you have this set up and get this going, you will essentially have this information solidified and locked in place.
Agent: So that way, anytime, you know, as changes are being made just because, you know, being in a startup or kind of being in the level of business that you guys are in, you guys need to move fast, you guys need to move quick.
Agent: However, it's like super important to have that relevant information that data stored somewhere.
Agent: And so... As we talked about, each of these kind of fields can be configured, but I want to bring your attention to a couple key things that I think would be actually super helpful.
Agent: So, [PERSON-1], one of the first things that I would personally do and something that we do for our accounts is we kind of get an idea of like which accounts are going to essentially be the most important accounts to focus on, especially for my account management fees.
Agent: So for example, maybe you guys have, we like to call them tiers. So for example, we have accounts that are tier from tier one through tier four.
Agent: Maybe for your VIP customers, your top spending customers, or where you think the bigger opportunities are.
Agent: Like a sofa, or [ORG-4] or [ORG-5] team, those are going to be considered tier ones Maybe your mountain pop shops are maybe more tier two tier threes, and then tier fours ar e essentially going to be maybe things that you want to don't want to pay attention to Now, that's a bit of work upfront, but once you get that handled and you have a bette r understanding of where these accounts should be tiered .
Agent: That'll give you the opportunity to kind of figure out where you will need to focus your timeline.
Agent: Right?
Agent: One thing I will say is that as you kind of get that tiered out and all this information gets updated, the cool thing about [ORG-1] is it's pretty dynamic in terms of being able to update information and more importantly just have all that relevant contact information in here as well.
Agent: As an account manager, something that I do personally is making sure that when I get an account assigned, I want to kind of just do some research on there.
Agent: And I want to make sure that the data is updated. So [PERSON-1], maybe from your standpoint, I don't know if you guys have access to, you know, a tool like Zoom info or even LinkedIn or anything like that.
Agent: What we do personally is essentially we'll take a look at the account.
Agent: We'll do some research in terms of looking at who's going to be, what that, you know, what that account does and more importantly, like who's going to be the key contact sport.
Agent: Now, this may be a little bit of work. I kind of going back and forth, but it kind of depends on maybe the accelerates and the information that you have there.
Agent: But what you can do is essentially update the contact information.
Agent: So that way, when you go into Once this is set up, you can essentially assign and make sure that all the relevant people that are part of this account essentially have all the contact information in there. Right.
Agent: So, for example, maybe you've got like a director here, a CFO, a [ORG-6], maybe somebody that sponsors or that deals with sponsorships and events, maybe somebody that deals with the actual kind of setup or your main points of contact.
Agent: Once that contact is updated in here, anybody can actually go in there,
EndUser: Look at the contact, retrieve the proper information and reach out to them.
EndUser: [PERSON-2], you got your hand up?
EndUser: Yeah. So, there's the organizational history here in the individual contact. Is there a way Two things.
EndUser: Do we, if we were to start tracking satisfaction by the account, would that be able to show up here where the satisfaction is coming from?
EndUser: In terms of who's saying, hey, we've got to thought was this.
EndUser: So kind of figure out where the ground truth is, if there was the range might be, if somebody's like a little frustrated versus I think this is great.
EndUser: So if the director level is saying, hey, we're having issues here, but the CFO and the CEO thinks it's great, then we know we got to work on that relationship.
EndUser: And also the age or the last contact to the, to the.
EndUser: Kind of the organization So when was the last time we connected with them How long, if it's been [DATE-3] when we need this What kind of rhythm do we have in speaking
Agent: With them So is there like a lag or a tracker on that We can look in here about Sure.
EndUser: ?
Agent: Yeah, [PERSON-2], it's just to kind of make sure I'm understanding that correctly. There's maybe like two questions there.
Agent: Number one, kind of getting a gauge as to kind of what the possible C-SAT score would be, right?
Agent: How satisfied the customers are and if we need to make note of any kind of particular customers or contacts within an account.
Agent: And then number two is essentially going to be kind of like a cadence, right?
Agent: Maybe like, hey, you haven't talked with this customer in [DATE-4] and maybe you have an internal cadence of touching base with the customer [DATE-5] or every two weeks, just as it. check in .
Agent: So a short answer is yes, and [ORG-7], you can be honest here. So number one, as far as just kind of making sure that customers are satisfied. There's a couple of different ways that you can do that.
Agent: You can essentially make notes, detail notes within like a specific contact itself. So for example, let's take [PERSON-6]. We'll click into him. And again, these fields can be configured depending on how you guys have that set up.
Agent: But maybe you have a specific field that talks about, you know, their satisfaction level. Again, [PERSON-2], that's something that maybe is something that you guys can build internally or work with CRM NINJAs, but maybe it's a grading system.
Agent: So it says, hey, satisfaction level is AD or C, right?
Agent: [PERSON-1], what he can do is, as you said in conversations, that's what I'm thinking right now is more like an idea. A day here is that you can have an update in [DATE-6] level.
Agent: So maybe it's a B satisfaction level.
Agent: Now, [PERSON-2], all of a sudden, you've got a report that feeds up to that kind of specific field that says, hey, these are all the customers that said that they were a B satisfaction level. Let's figure out why.
Agent: And maybe let's kind of work our way through that list to kind of get them from a B to a K. That's one idea.
Agent: The other idea that we talked about [DATE-7] was, you know, possibly seeing them like a satisfaction, you know, reporter kind of like a [ORG-8] or even like a survey. after a specific job is done.
Agent: I think that might be more on the email side, but that's just an idea that comes to mind right now, which you guys can essentially do or implement.
Agent: [ORG-7], do you have any other ideas around that section?
Agent: No, I think you pretty much covered it.
Agent: [PERSON-2], my question for you is how are you tracking satisfaction [DATE-8]?
Agent: And it sounds like you want to do at
EndUser: Individual contact level, so I'm wondering if any form of that exists. No, we need to build that. So we need to, whether it's MPSC7, we need to start assessing our performance. Our performance is
Agent: A product as well as our performance as the home managers. Got it, okay. And then your ideal world is, you're not just tracking like [ORG-8] from an account
EndUser: Perspective, but you can actually understand how the individuals within those accounts. I think that, I think, I mean... I think that can be powerful. I think that can be helpful in terms of obsolete or building relationships.
EndUser: So if we are ideally, I don't want to be the negative here, but if there's a possibility that we can be failing on the ground with an expert, the director or whoever's the manager of the product in the venue, and the leadership is happy with it because they think they're doing great.
EndUser: So we need to know we need to, make that better. Conversely, it could be just the inverse too, that the leadership is having it as a negative opinion, but the groups on the ground, people are happy.
Agent: So then we need to work with them to say, hey, what do we do to do to change this girl?
Agent: Because we know there's something certain. Yeah, that makes sense. No, I think [PERSON-3] covered some of the really great ways we can go about that.
Agent: Another thing I want to add is, I don't know if we've brought up the idea or the concept of app exchange, which is our third party at marketplace for [ORG-1].
Agent: So there's a lot of free and paid apps that exist on the app exchange that we at [ORG-1] use it to integrates very seamlessly into [ORG-1].
Agent: And what I'm thinking about in particular is like a relationship map to being able to visualize.
Agent: Like who the contacts are, like in [ORG-1] you can put this person's a VP, this person's a manager but there are some acts that are able to showcas e like who rolls up to who and then be able to indicat e that individual satisfaction level that wa y from like a sales or customer success perspective you can really see like , who do you need to please?
Agent: Like what is the stakeholder management I've seen a lot of customers of ours do.
EndUser: Process?
EndUser: So that's just another thing that
Agent: What was the tool?
Agent: What was the tool?
Agent: So it's our [ORG-1] app exchange. We can definitely find a few but these are third party apps outside of [ORG-1] that integrate into [ORG-1].
EndUser: Relationship maps to suggest,
Agent: Is there one that Um, give, give me a quick stack.
EndUser: You like?
Agent: It's been a while since I looked at some of the but they're, I can't remember the name, but there's one in particular that
EndUser: Relationship maps,
EndUser: Is able to show like the, um, the hierarchy. So let me find that and we can definitely send that over. And [ORG-7], just one more thing.
EndUser: If you think of any apps during this call or while you're looking through apps, if you don't mind sending those over, that would be really helpful.
EndUser: I mean, we wanna build a really, it'll take [TIME-1] to get there, but we wanna build a really robust system here.
EndUser: So anything that you think would be helpful and applicable to our use case, if you don't mind sharing that, I think that'd be really helpful.
Agent: And sorry for being camera off here. We're doing some construction downstairs. I have people walking behind me nonstop. No, no, totally good.
Agent: And yes, we will send over as we're going through this and I'm hearing more, I'll let you know if there's any that come to top of my head, but we will send over the app exchange link and some relationship options afterwards.
Agent: [PERSON-2], to answer your second question about, hey, can I pull up, figure out a way to kind of see like when the last reach out or last contact or last activity was with a specific account, right?
Agent: You can absolutely do that. That's configurable through essentially reporting. So when going to [ORG-1], you can go into reports. I don't think I have one preloaded in here.
Agent: But what I can do is maybe just paint the picture audibly and then kind of explain how that would be. So again, this is a pipeline report. You can kind of configure this how you want to be.
Agent: But something that we do personally is that we'll have accounts set up and then we'll also have last activity evier.
Agent: And if we see that last activity is essentially said, like, hey, this account hasn't been reached out to in [DATE-9].
Agent: What's going on?
Agent: You click into that. Maybe no activity is going to record it.
Agent: So keeping it super simple, you know, you can have that report saved for each of your single one of your team members, the leaders on the charge fees and then more importantly, have that back on your homepage.
Agent: So, let's just say, for example, again, these are all configurable reports. Maybe you create that report. [PERSON-1] has that in here and says, Hey, these are my marquee my top tier one accounts.
Agent: My last activity was, you know, [DATE-10]. Let's go ahead and maybe just contact them just as a touch base and [PERSON-1], you can configure that. Whatever. where I saw my eyes are gonna be internally .
Agent: Awesome, so I'll pause there. Again, we'll kind of go back to accounts, but I wanted to see if there were any other questions on here before moving on to the next section.
Agent: Everybody's all good. Okay. Cool, so the other portion that's really important that I wanted to show you guys is these activities. be it right here.
Agent: So as far as activity is concerned, this is going to allow you to kind of track activity as you go throughout your day.
Agent: So, for example, [PERSON-1], maybe you had a conversation with this account and you want to make sure that I'm about to know that it's in the account. So that way everybody has a visibility into it.
Agent: You can go here and you can essentially press this button. This essentially will allow you to log a call and then also create notes as well.
Agent: So for example, maybe at a meeting with [ORG-6], they want to have the event coming up in [DATE-9], wants to rent 10 kiosks. and whatnot. So you can actually store those notes in there.
Agent: You can actually set, you know, there's different ways you can configure this, but essentially if you want to set a reminder for yourself, you can absolutely set a reminder yourself to call moving check back in [DATE-16].
Agent: And then call results, you know, you can essentially mark that clear so that way you have visibility as to kind of what that call was.
Agent: In this case, we'll just say meaningful contact, and then you can actually assign that into a contact itself. So again, this is just kind of like a basic setup.
Agent: You guys might have this configured differently, but as you have conversations or making notes with the account or making progress with other contexts, you'll have that saved.
Agent: And now all of a sudden you've got this activity list that's gonna be updating in real time.
Agent: So anytime somebody needs to come in and say like, hey, what's going on?
Agent: What's the most recent conversations that we've had?
Agent: You can see that within here.
Agent: And [PERSON-7], I'll pause there.
Agent: I'm just curious, how are you guys handling internal communications now?
Agent: Is that something you guys are tracking as kind of seed here?
Agent: Or is that maybe you going to [ORG-9] and maybe making notes as to what
EndUser: Conversations are happening within accounts?
EndUser: Well, we use [DATE-14] for updates for a lot of our communications with venues. But yeah, I mean, it's mostly... all just in emails and like,
Agent: But [PERSON-5]'s has been handling it for the last like, you know, year or so. So it's mostly. Got it. Okay. Okay. And we chatted pretty quickly about [DATE-14] [DATE-7] with [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-2].
Agent: Is [ORG-10]?
Agent: It seems like he goes using it as a ticketing system that you also communicate with the venues themselves or do your contacts have access to [DATE-14]?
EndUser: No, no, it's all internal. And we don't use it to communicate. We just, well, we use it to communicate internally, but not
Agent: To any of our accounts. It's just a repository
EndUser: For information related to the accounts. Got it. And what kind of information are you guys, you know, communicating in [DATE-14] that maybe you're trying to bring it to. So for example, like,
Agent: If a venue swaps a station, like we would note that in [DATE-14]. So that's it. We haven't
EndUser: Noted somewhere. OK, got it. And then is that something that
Agent: You just refer to or is that sales and then maybe even like the operations?
Agent: So that's the one. Yeah, most of us. OK. Got it. Yeah, so if that's the case what you can start doing and you know Maybe this is like a broader discussion to maybe start having
EndUser: As well as you guys continue like meetings or notes You can essentially make sure that the activities are logged into here and then You know, so you know No, I like this activity thing a lot. Um,
Agent: Is that The
Agent: Way that we see it right now is that how it normally shows or is activity like minimized?
Agent: So your activity, so out of the box activity panels on the right hand side, but you can move it around the screen. Okay. So you can have it like in a map if you scroll up.
EndUser: If you if you want it like
Agent: As a tab on the left hand side, so you click into it there and see that view, you could, you could do it that
Agent: Way. Cool. I like that a lot.
Agent: [PERSON-3], I don't know if I missed this.
Agent: Did you talk about the email integration piece as well?
Agent: I haven't yet.
Agent: I was actually on the last, but [PERSON-6], do you want to maybe speak to that?
Agent: Yeah. So one more thing that I think would be really beneficial for you all is so with [ORG-9] and Outlook.
EndUser: [ORG-1] has a native integration
Agent: Which one of those do you use [DATE-8]?
Agent: [ORG-9] and [ORG-9].
Agent: Gmail?
Agent: Okay. Yeah, so how the email integration with [ORG-9] works is it's a bi-directional sync.
Agent: So essentially when you're working on [ORG-9] and you're sending an email, you could have on your Gmail screen like a right-hand side panel that shows the account information while you're writing the email.
Agent: So that way you don't have to go into [ORG-1] and flip back and forth in order to get the information to craft like a really valuable email.
Agent: And then when you type out that email and you send it, that can automatically log into [ORG-1].
Agent: And then when you come to [ORG-1] and you're not jumping back and forth between email, you can actually see the contents of that email directly within [ORG-1]. There's a few other productivity tools like you can.
Agent: You can see when someone opens the email So you know when to kind of jump on that There's templates, pre-built out templates, quick text being able to send availability There's a lot of productivity tool s that we have with that integration but it's one that I'm sure matches [DATE-11] Like we here at [ORG-1] use that integration .
Agent: Like we don't think we can live without it because it's basically how we work without jumping between like email system and [ORG-1].
Agent: Um, but just wanted to check if that If that makes sense and compared to how you're doing things with like just
Agent: Capturing stuff
EndUser: And email and [ORG-10] right now. Like, how does that experience potentially feel
EndUser: [PERSON-8]. No, no, run.
EndUser: Now you run. Ideally it'll be easier to be there and just, you know, everyone's body works for back and forth. So yeah, you're having the database, the contact
Agent: List together, updated where everybody can work together in units I think that's going to be the valuable asset here.
Agent: And keep it updated advantage.
Agent: Yeah, and just to show you about. Let me go ahead. Sorry. Oh, no, go for it.
Agent: I was going to say, just to show you guys eventually, even just like for my own [ORG-9] setup, right?
Agent: So what [ORG-7] was referring to, just to give you guys a more visual, is the [ORG-1] integration. Again, this is native.
Agent: So anytime we need to, if I pull up like an email, for example, what it's going to do is actually look into your [ORG-1].
Agent: So if you need to pull up relevant information within your email without having to jump back into [ORG-1], you can absolutely do that. You can look at the account, different opportunities, people that are tied into a specific thread.
Agent: And then as you send off an email, we mainly have to log the email, but actually there's a future I believe that you can turn it on to where it's synced automatically.
Agent: And you'll have the emails essentially being synced as you guys kind of send them out and receive. So that way it goes and it shows back into that activities list that we're talking about.
Agent: So for example, if I just shot off that email, takes [TIME-2], it'll actually load up into here. And then again, it keeps everything in that one nice spot, so anybody can refer back to that.
Agent: Awesome. So guys, we talked about the accounts, talked about opportunities, we talked about the email integration as well, too, we'll send some more literature on that as well.
Agent: Maybe just a touch base, I know we're on coming up on time here, but just a touch base on cases and what this could potentially mean.
Agent: So it sounds like there is a way for customers to submit cases through [ORG-10] currently. [PERSON-1], keep me honest here, but some of the accounts, what they can do is essentially submit like a case through [ORG-10].
Agent: And then that gets. that's routed to you or the operation s we're cutting success team . Yeah. Yeah. And a nutshell. Okay.
Agent: And then do you personally go into to money.com just kind of review the tickets or the cases and kind of see what you can do in terms of being able
EndUser: To help out or how does that point to you?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: We can do that. We sometimes do that. OK, so just to kind of keep something in mind, and this is, again, it's going to be like an ongoing conversation.
Agent: But once you have, this is going to be sales cloud, but once you have Service Cloud kind of put into place, what you can do here is the Service Cloud essentially would replace [ORG-16].
Agent: It would act as like a ticketing system for customers to submit support cases. And where this kind of really comes into play for us, even very particularly [PERSON-9] handling the account, it seems like a making good traction.
Agent: Want to have an opportunity to upsell them into a different product But there was a support case that [ORG-14] submitted that maybe somebody's been, you know from the account is unhappy about some specific thing .
Agent: Where this becomes really powerful, is that me as a sales rep, I can actually quickly go into the case's file, and again, this is all configurably different.
Agent: But... What I can do is essentially look at the cases, click into them and kind of see like what the case is all about.
Agent: And if I'm working with either the sales team, the account management team, or the operations team, I can really figure out, hey, what is happening with this case?
Agent: What is happening with this particular solution?
Agent: And who do we need to
EndUser: Get in order to make sure that this customer is back happy, whether that's operations or sales?
EndUser: I'll pause there, [PERSON-2].
EndUser: You had a question?
EndUser: So it turns out how we set the accounts up here.
EndUser: One of the things that were just as I kind of needed to get up to speed, there's a whole success email chain of things that were reaching out to the customers and hey, we're sending you inventory.
EndUser: We're doing this. If you check out this to a lot of venue partners, if we're having and we use that with our success associates who are based in the [GPE-2].
EndUser: So how are you guys?
EndUser: How can we configure?
EndUser: Is it figuring this integrate with their emails and already bills so that if we get they were to send something it might show up here is that an option.
EndUser: So that they're a record of what they do show the character we are like a. A associate level
Agent: For like a limited tier action and sales force for them to use They would need [ORG-1] access for, um, for that email information to to show up.
EndUser: For the agents.
Agent: Um, actually, let me, let me just clarify. So are they going to be actioning on
EndUser: Anything like within sales for us?
EndUser: Or is it just the fact that their emails being like them responding via email needs to show up on the case?
EndUser: Ideally their, their email would showing up would be, would be the one thing. So there was a message in the action, but if they're contacting, if a chart, something a client
Agent: From charge use emails, or partner of ours, it'd be nice if that interaction would show up in here. Okay. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: I was going to say in that case, as long as they're on the email chain, I think that email would show up, but it's not necessarily the best practices we recommend because they don't have visibility into any of the internal case information.
Agent: So I would love to dig into a little bit more, and I know we're up on time, so maybe this is a future conversation.
Agent: How are they responding on their end?
Agent: What kind of... What kind of like account data do they have?
Agent: Like how are the action upon like fixing issues in order to do their jobs?
Agent: But yeah, to your point, if they do have [ORG-1] access and what we're seeing with customers, actually they can review the case right here and they can actually respond within this field.
Agent: We can even create templates and much of the other customers do is that they'll just send it off here. So that way all the communication is tracked with that particular case.
Agent: And then as cases are being moved along the lines, this case can essentially
Agent: Be either staged as working on, waiting for the customer or even closed. And then you'll have all the information.
Agent: Away from th e Also, just to verify, I know we're up on time, so hopefully I can just question short.
Agent: What this customer success team does, it sounds like after a sale is made, they probably have a series of tasks to onboard the customer
EndUser: Or make sure they're set up for success.
EndUser: Is that an accurate representation or am I missing anything there?
EndUser: It's a little new, it's probably a little bit more nuanced. in the sense that the sales and the account managers are having to shepherd the install process for the machines.
EndUser: And then the success team should be there, keeping things fertile, and being good stewards of the account, helping be good stewards of the account. So make sure that [DATE-16] that it works.
EndUser: The inventory is making take care of advertising, burning this should be, you know, payments or being, you know, performance reports are being said as needed. That sort of thing.
EndUser: So that's where these success teams should be coming up there and making sure everything's going on. And then the account manager and sales team will be the point of contact something that's bothering
Agent: For follow-ups later on. Or if there's or an alert from the venue, then they should be the first people. So it's a give-and-take. Yeah, okay, that makes sense.
Agent: Um, no, I think we have some things to think on in terms of like making sure. We definitely have a lot of customers
EndUser: That have an account management type role, and they do different things. So thank you for clarifying exactly what you guys do.
EndUser: We have not broken it up yet to have sales banks are just doing sales and then letting go of the accounts. We're not there yet. I think we will be shortly. I don't think we're there yet.
Agent: You disagree with kind of another vision, but that's kind of where I see it at least from [DATE-14]
EndUser: Okay, and they're using [ORG-16] right now in spreadsheets right to track a lot of the sales
Agent: Side Therefore, as I understand it, I think they're fully on doing salesforce. So Oh, I meant the
EndUser: Is the event side house.
EndUser: The account managers Help managers are using Okay
Agent: Sales for sure now. That's what the disconnects to success and the operations are predominantly
Agent: On [DATE-18]. So we got some bridging that. Yeah, got it. OK, that makes sense. OK, well, guys, thanks for the chat [DATE-8]. And hopefully this is what was helpful. Here's what we'll do.
Agent: We go ahead and send the Recording out to you guys and send the resources that we talked about. We'll take a look at the app change.
Agent: I think [ORG-7] and I kind of have even more, but a much better understanding of what you guys are looking to do and what the current process is like.
Agent: I think as far as just maybe even a conversation with the operation inside of the house and get it better and just sitting in the town [DATE-14] and how that floor works would be super useful.
Agent: That's something that won't work on our side. And then of course, [PERSON-2], [PERSON-1], [PERSON-10], if you guys have any other questions, anything that we can help with, as you guys continue that's it.
EndUser: To, you know, get on [ORG-11],
Agent: Feel free to reach out to me.
EndUser: Awesome. Thanks, [PERSON-3]. You guys take care. Have a good one. It's like you soon.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""How are you guys handling internal communications now? Is that something you guys are tracking as kind of seed here? Or is that maybe you going to [ORG-9] and maybe making notes as to what conversations are happening within accounts?""

The customer seemed more engaged after this question as they provided a detailed explanation of their current communication process and expressed interest in the possibility of integrating it with the sales rep's system.

2. ""What this customer success team does, it sounds like after a sale is made, they probably have a series of tasks to onboard the customer or make sure they're set up for success. Is that an accurate representation or am I missing anything there?""

The customer provided a more detailed explanation of the customer success team's role after this question, showing that they were more engaged in the conversation.

3. ""What kind of like account data do they have? Like how are they responding on their end? What kind of... What kind of tasks are they doing in order to do their jobs?""

The customer's response to this question indicated that they were more engaged, as they provided additional information about the tasks and responsibilities of their customer success team.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:

1. ""What are your thoughts on that so far?""
2. ""Is that kind of making sense in deviancy?""
3. ""As far as just kind of creating an opportunity, right? Say you're working with this group, you identify an opportunity. You actually just going to, there's a couple of different ways, but one of the easiest ways usually right here, on the top right, we'll see a hot key button that says new opportunity, or you can usually click down and sometimes they'll be added here as well. So let's go ahead and click to new opportunity. What's going to pop up in your end is going to be configured differently. But however, this is just kind of a general standpoint, you'll have a couple different fields here that you can complete, right?""
4. ""So for example, anything that might be relevant for charge through specifically will be right here.""
5. ""But for the most part, you'll have an opportunity name, the amount of whatever you think that opportunity is going to land at a specific close date.""
6. ""Sometimes, for example, if it's a quicker sales cycle for us specifically, maybe it's like a [DATE-1] sales sale cycle, other times it might be like [DATE-2] days out.""
7. ""The reason that's important is because as you guys create opportunities, this feeds up into the data for [PERSON-2] and everybody else to be able to kind of track how much revenue and how much these opportunities are going to be. For forecasting purposes, if that makes sense.""
8. ""And then of course the different stages as well, hey, are you prospecting, qualification discovery, all dependent on which our truth has for that self-process.""
9. ""A few things here. Quick? Yeah.""
10. ""So what [PERSON-3] is showing is this screen right here can be completely configurable. This, their opportunity page obviously will probably capture more details than just four fields.""
11. ""So that bare minimum, like what needs to be filled out in order for an opportunity exists.""
12. ""Those required fields, like we could configure it so that that that form is is basically capturing a necessary field before creating an opportunity.""
13. ""But another thing I want to point out is If you import your data from your spreadsheet and you have your accounts existing, yes, you could create an opportunity this way.""
14. ""But if you have, at least from a sales perspective, if you have like a lead qualification process, we could create leads and have them automatically convert to opportunities once the leads are qualified.""
15. ""And then I know we're talking specifically about account management. So once you have your accounts, you have a few opportunities that are established, maybe they're closed down. out.""
16. ""I'm making some assumptions here so please feel free to correct me if I' m talking about some of the wrong processes but from an account management perspective once you have closed out opportunities potentially you might have a customer that needs to go through like a renewal process or needs to amen d something on the opportunity so we could on the account itself there' s different automations that could be set up so that the information get s automatically pulled from like a old opportunity so you're not [ORG-3] y re-kaying some of this stuff.""
17. ""But just wanted to just talk through some of the different ways that opportunities can be create d, what [PERSON-3] is showing is just one way of doing it, but there's definitely different ways f or opportunities to get create d.""
18. ""So I wanted to just lay that out there and ask the question s. When it comes to the account management team a nd dealing with opportunities, what does that look lik e?""
19. ""And it sounds like you want to do at [DATE-8]? And it sounds like you want to do it at an individual contact level, so I'm wondering if any form of that exists. No, we need to build that. So we need to, whether it's MPSC7, we need to start assessing our performance. Our performance is a product as well as our performance as the home managers.""
20. ""And then your ideal world is, you're not just tracking like [ORG-8] from an account perspective, but you can actually understand how the individuals",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide enough information to determine if there were opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs. The sales rep asked several questions to understand the customer's needs and current processes, but it is not clear if there were additional opportunities for further exploration.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer to this question is unclear. The customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They did ask questions and express interest in various features and functionalities, but a clear statement of satisfaction or dissatisfaction was not provided."
video_14191_167_6qr3y000000oc5JAAQ,"Speaker 5: Cool, thanks.
Agent: And if I get any good insights out of it, I will more than happy to share it with you guys. But I'm expecting, so thanks for popping on. It's nice to meet you guys.
Agent: I thought that we just keep this informal, we'll do some introductions. If there are certain topics you want to discuss, I know you had reached out to [PERSON-1]. Looking for [PERSON-2], we can talk about that too.
Agent: And just kind of see where this takes us.
Agent: [PERSON-3], how about you start?
Speaker 5: Sure. I am [PERSON-4]. I'm the director of listener care, primarily working on the [LOC-1] side of the business.
Speaker 5: We've been riding with [ORG-1] now as our primary [PRODUCT-1] since [DATE-1], [DATE-2], was I think when we migrated over.
Speaker 5: And we have seen a significant amount of development over that time, you know, starting in the classic console moved over to lightning. Eventually, I think maybe around [DATE-3] was our official move over to lightning.
Speaker 5: And most recently in [DATE-4], we went live with an Einstein for service feature set, including case classification article and reply recommendations, along with some next best action. features incorporated.
Speaker 5: So really at this point where we're at is we have a fairly refined service console.
Speaker 5: We're going to be looking at [DATE-5] ROI of that [PERSON-5] for service Implementation for that we worked with [ORG-2] as our Implementation partner. And I think things are going pretty well right now, I'd say.
Speaker 5: And [PERSON-6] here, who I'll pass it over to [PERSON-6], but he's our operations manager. And he does a lot of the Salesforce Service Cloud upkeep. Yeah,
EndUser: I'm [PERSON-6]. I'm an operations manager, like [PERSON-3] said. Sir, my dog is barking in the background. And yeah, I worked for [PERSON-3]. other leaders, including our community and social manager and a few others.
EndUser: And in [ORG-1], I guess I have a pretty good working understanding just from being part of the Implementation in [DATE-1].
EndUser: Then also, I work with our [ORG-1] developers and people on our Enterprise services team to develop new features, report bugs. I'm the go between that team and our team.
EndUser: I also spend a good amount of time on reports and dashboards for [PERSON-3] and others. We've got a lot of them and then I also build them out for our outsource.
EndUser: Tata team in [GPE-1] and we've been working with them
Speaker 5: Since [DATE-1]. [PERSON-3]. Yeah, [DATE-6]. So they were, you know, when we onboarded our.
EndUser: They were
Speaker 5: In [ORG-1] already or in Service And then like a
Agent: Club. PTO, like a... For
EndUser: The customer. Okay, yeah. And they made a really big difference in being the frontline agents. And that allowed us to have the other [GPE-2] [GPE-3] folks focus more on specialized projects.
EndUser: And, Yeah, I build dashboards for like I said [PERSON-3] and uh, I'll source team and. agents so they can track their own [ORG-3] and things like that.
EndUser: And then we do have and manage some of the tools like we have a third party of under deep commerce that powers our search on the help site that's through [ORG-1].
EndUser: They also power our chat bot which works with the API at [ORG-1] to bring those chats into the agent view and then Also, get feedback for our surveys. Most of the surveys are tied into sales force.
EndUser: We can report on them. We've got a newer one that doesn't involve cases that we just back get feedback.
Agent: I think that's a lot of what I do right now.
EndUser: Who do you use for your surveys and feedback?
EndUser: Get feedback, which I guess is service monkey, which is
Speaker 5: Momentum. That's right. Yeah, [PERSON-6]. Yeah.
Speaker 5: And we're also, you know, we're mostly a service based support team, we're as opposed to being sales based, right?
Speaker 5: Like we're not doing a bunch of saves or anything like that. We're more of quality of service of our product. And you know, fostering that relationship between our insights and our internal product and development teams.
Speaker 5: So that's like our bread and butter, at least this, this charter here on the [LOC-1] side. So we do also have a JIRA integration.
Speaker 5: That we use all the time In jerevings, [ORG-4] between our stakeholders inside and then having that [ORG-5] has been an amazing success for u s to be able to track things and report on things I also do want to mention, someone who's not here toda y is our [ORG-6] manager, [GPE-4] [GPE-5] Manages our internal and external knowledge bas e
Agent: All hosted within Service Cloud . OK, I might
Speaker 5: Need help spelling that or you can email me that.
Agent: I might have missed that. Yeah, I can. I can shoot you an email with. OK, I was looking in the.
Speaker 5: I was looking in the invite to see if
Agent: It's in there, but it wasn't in there either. So no problem.
Agent: Do you do base in service cloud?
EndUser: Your knowledge
Agent: In service cloud?
Agent: Well, OK. Knowledge base.
EndUser: All right, where are you based out of [PERSON-6]?
Agent: I'm an [GPE-2] team.
EndUser: I work from home. OK.
Agent: And then I was just really. Oh, by the back of my home. Yeah.
Agent: Oh, there I And then you're all cleaned as well, right?
Speaker 5: Can see it. OK.
Agent: Mm-hmm. OK, cool. I can do a quick intro. So my name is [PERSON-7]. I've been at [ORG-1] just a little over six years. Prior to [ORG-1], I was at [ORG-7] for about five and a half.
Agent: And then I was in data storage for a little while prior that at [ORG-8] and E&C. So I've been in the IT space like 14ish. [DATE-7] or
Agent: So. My first role at [ORG-1], I was a core account executive like [PERSON-1]. And then I was a global account manager for a little while.
Agent: And then when we started the Service Cloud prime business, I like to affectionately tell people that I was volunteered to come over to this new business unit.
Agent: When we started it [DATE-8], I've actually been in the entire time.
Agent: It's kind of fun being a little bit more of a specialist and focusing on a certain set of products versus our wider expanse of offerings.
Agent: I think when I started at [ORG-1], we were 18,000 employees and [MONEY-1]. and revenue or so in [DATE-9]. So it's been a very interesting growth and drive and change and stuf f like that. So .
Agent: I have about seven or eight accounts, so [LOC-1], [ORG-9], [PERSON-8], [PERSON-9], mostly B2B, [ORG-10], [ORG-15], [ORG-15], [ORG-14] and [GPE-6], mainly [LOC-2] accounts, but I am based out of [GPE-7]. Nice to meet you guys.
Agent: Nice And happy to ever come out and see you.
Speaker 5: To meet you, [PERSON-10].
Agent: Sorry, we missed you in [DATE-10] at our conference, but there's always more things to do [GPE-8]. So we'll keep it in mind. And if you guys ever get to [GPE-7] or [GPE-9], make sure to let me know.
Agent: And happy to try to meet up with you so we can meet in person sometime. Cool.
Speaker 5: Sounds good. I see
Agent: We have two people us.
EndUser: Join Yeah.
Agent: [PERSON-15], do you want to introduce yourself, please?
EndUser: Sure, [PERSON-10], nice to meet you. I am the senior product manager, primarily focusing on the sales force-related implementations and support activities. I'm working with Ganesh and [PERSON-15] from [ORG-15].
EndUser: And our team comprises of the product owners who generally work on the new enhancements request, primarily focused on the [LOC-1] side-door business.
Agent: And where are you based out of [PERSON-15]?
EndUser: I'm in [GPE-10], which is near [GPE-2].
Agent: Ah, yep, yep. Okay. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Agent: And then Si, how about your intro please?
Speaker 6: Hey, [NORP-1], this is [PRODUCT-2]. Technical architect for [ORG-1] implementations and I work very closely with like an all of our stakeholders. On the service side, sales side, and what very close with Ganesh, [PERSON-14] and [PERSON-15].
Agent: And where are you based out of [GPE-2].
Speaker 6: Sae?
Speaker 6: Oh,
Agent: And [GPE-2] as well. OK, so most of you guys are on that area. OK. I guess this is really meant to be open. I would usually ask like what's working and what's not working.
Agent: So when we start with what's working, it sounds like for the most part, things are going well. Good to hear your enlightening. Service Cloud Einstein, I think, is always a good level two. Next step for most customers.
Agent: Some of the other areas we can work on, I think, but they sound like they're going well.
Agent: Any other things that are going well you want to share?
EndUser: Thank you.
Speaker 5: Yeah, I'd say you covered it all right there, [PERSON-10]. As we're looking forward, I think [DATE-15] has been a lot of refinement, has been sort of our efforts while introducing [PERSON-5] features.
Agent: Past
Speaker 5: So we're kind of feeling fairly refined, which is nice, at least for the agent side of things.
Speaker 5: And then as we move forward, I think we'll just look for opportunities to further build out things like next best action, finding ways it's again applicable to our business. And look for various ways to further automate workflows.
Speaker 5: You know, and I think some of that is dependent on things that are happening internally or have the potential to happen internally. So as those details come to light,
Agent: As we're more familiar with what things potentially look like next think we'll have a better sense
Speaker [DATE-15] and beyond, I of how to incorporate that into our service offering.
Speaker 5: How many agents do you guys have in like across your peers?
Speaker 5: Roughly. We have about. Including [PERSON-15]. about 18 frontline agents in [GPE-15]. So that's through [ORG-14], [ORG-18]. And then full time here.
Speaker 5: I think we're a lean and mean 10, about 10 full time folks working on various projects, some of which are in service class, some of which aren't, with [PERSON-6] being sort of that primary operational stakeholder for us.
Speaker 5: And he does a lot of the onboarding work for our [ORG-15]. And then, oh, I did want to mention, I think it's worth mentioning, we did recently at some point. [DATE-14].
Speaker 5: It had to have been [DATE-14]. We got a demo of Messaging like asynchronous messaging, the [ORG-1] offering there. You know, that would be a channel that we are interested in.
Speaker 5: Seeing how it may influence our business as well, because we want to make sure that we're offering to our service channels for our customers.
Speaker 5: But I do really want to be mindful of what the wins are as it relates to introducing something like that.
Speaker 5: And I know for quite some time we've been fond of the idea of [ORG-1] like SDK to allow us to ingest more customer insights up front. You know, so some level of integration with our actual [LOC-1] product.
Speaker 5: Of course, that would require sort of internal. conversations and selling of that idea.
Speaker 5: But if we could begin to crystallize what that could offer us as far as a customer 328, and the type of information we'd be able to gather with that sort of implementation, those are just a couple areas that we could see further expanding our current suite of channels and offerings.
Agent: Are you thinking SMS, [ORG-18], [ORG-18], all the above or one of those specifically or anything?
Speaker 5: Yeah, that's a great question. You know, we were kind of... probably just at the tip of iceberg as far as the conversation around which actual Messaging channels, what they would actually look like.
Speaker 5: And SMS would introduce a new [ORG-18] type factor for us where we currently don't have phone numbers at all, but we would. So I think there's a lot of considerations around that.
Speaker 5: I think at the most basic level, we would be replacing our live chat, live agent with. ips me ininging
Agent: . Okay, okay.
EndUser: And then I wanted to clarify just a little thing.
EndUser: You probably have other SDKs, but we were thinking about the mobile SDK for the Pandora And what we could do is that and what we could bring in, like [PERSON-3] said.
Agent: App.
EndUser: And then depending on how much information we can give from the app, one nice thing to learn about [DATE-15] would be like maybe like Data Cloud and what internal information or from the app or whatever we could or internal tools we could possibly also introduce to get that 328 view.
EndUser: But I haven't even discussed that with Chilling.
EndUser: And so it's But maybe it'd be cool, we'll join everybody [DATE-14] and time to get some more information around that, right?
Agent: Pretty far off.
Speaker 5: Yeah, I think we're gonna see roads merging in that direction probably.
Agent: Yeah. Your brother is a
Agent: Good. That is what we're doing for the [ORG-18] app right now. We have the SDK, it's going to be installed into and secondly, the website.
EndUser: The mobile app,
Agent: So there's two purposes for that.
Agent: One is to gather listening data and all types of behavioral data about what type of Content customers are hovering over even just looking at to build the FINDI It also plays a role in what offers are going to be recommended or can be recommended to a customer for [ORG-18].
EndUser: Browsing or profiles.
Agent: And also could play a role in next best action.
Agent: So the shorty bit is absolutely, I think, the internal selling on your side would be quite, I don't want to say be very much aligned with what we're doing for the app launch for [DATE-18].
EndUser: Easy, but it'll
Agent: And I know that, you know, when we transacted on [PRODUCT-3] and marketing cloud, there was always a vision. to try to get Pandora on his a phase two. So we're very much focused on serious <inaudible>.
Agent: I'm streaming I think [DATE-15] might be the perfect time to start talking about how do we make sure that Pandora can make use of [ORG-18] that makes sense and certainly the SDKs.
EndUser: Right now, but
Agent: So,
Speaker 5: Yeah, we're very much on the same page, [PERSON-1].
Speaker 5: That sounds like a great plan You know, and I think that'll allow us internally to look at, you know, the distinct brands as sort of a more cohesive way of supporting with in listener care and side grading and all that sort of stuff across different brands and services.
Agent: For.
Speaker 5: So we would love to tap in all that infrastructure that you're standing up on the series, and I'm sorry. And
EndUser: [PERSON-15] is surprised by this because he has to do a lot of work.
Speaker 5: So
EndUser: We're just adding on to your projects from the
Agent: Screen. Right. Taking a stick with the series section team of [PERSON-14] just
EndUser: Poured it over. It begins to go.
EndUser: And you know way, it was supposed to be the other way down where whatever another had, it was supposed to be taken away by series exam.
Speaker 5: What, in the reverse
EndUser: But that series exam is starting on a brand new slate and picking up the new offerings from salesforce.
EndUser: Implementation
EndUser: So we'd like to just like to streamline those and see ideas we are missing out from.
EndUser: What
EndUser: What we have implemented so far
EndUser: . Yeah, we're
Agent: Working on that right now. A series [ORG-18] probably a lot more to come.
Agent: We'd say in [DATE-18] or so, depending on what shakes out of some of the workshops we're having over [DATE-18] with them to see what we can do across there.
Agent: They have about 6,187 agents. So there's a lot of efficiencies that can be had with some of these technologies, probably leaning a little bit more on the [PRODUCT-4] side.
Agent: But there are some things we're going to look to do. And then we'll let you know in [DATE-18] if that makes a big enough business impact for a serious exam to move forward with that.
Agent: One or two things I thought of, I always kind of say like, you know, if you guys are using [PRODUCT-5] for service, you talked a little bit about next best action.
Agent: There are about seven or eight different features in there. So if you haven't familiarized yourself with all those like case classification, article recommendations, reply recommendations, please look through all those.
Agent: With 21 agents, you're not going to see a huge bump in productivity, you know, it's different if you have 6,000, but still probably some activity gains to look at by implementing some of those features.
Agent: You already own it and it's all predictive So it's just looking at past case and plotting it It's already Oh, you do I want to have some context action .
EndUser: History or replies three in place
Agent: Cool, cool, good. Okay. That was one just if you mentioned if you're ever thinking about vendor consolidation or like simplifying your tech stack.
Agent: You, I should have looked, I think you have sales and [PRODUCT-6], but I will confirm. You do get 19 chatbot conversations per license per month.
Agent: So it is possibly a way to bring down your cost by bringing the chatbot in house. I will warn you, we don't have the world's best chatbot, but it usually can do [PERCENT-1] of what customers want.
Agent: So that might be something to look at. And we're also coming out with the unified search product. I don't know if that's going to be free or an additional cost.
Agent: It'll be similar to like a COVAO or something like that. It's not generally available yet. So those are just some things to think about. about . as well as feedback management.
Agent: That is an additional feature as well, but that is available on platform we're using the same objects, same admin dev tools. So there's some things to think about. Anything not working out well that you need some assistance with.
EndUser: Oh, it's good when there's silence. So I'll take that maybe. Yeah. We take a look at our console and the components and just being at the twerking what the possibilities are for improving it.
EndUser: And that might all be internal work, but but if we do get some more customer insight in the future, it'd be cool to, you know, bring that all in together.
EndUser: So, but I think between [PERSON-15] and [PERSON-3] and I and the team, we could probably figure out ways to kind of
Agent: Make the console a little more updated to what we need to.
Speaker 5: Then is there is. Yeah, go ahead. Oh, I was going to say, you know, that sounds like a good idea is just checking in on. the formatting of the console.
Speaker 5: And in addition to that, I think I'd like to understand what sort of like templates are available for our site, just to see if there is an opportunity to up, our help site, which you know, is currently posted by you all.
Agent: You know, get that a facelift,
Speaker 5: And seeing if there are any other templates available that would fit for sort of a facelift there, or be a good fit. I mean, I think we're pretty pleased. We're fairly pleased with it and it's working well.
Speaker 5: But in the spirit of, you know, kind of none being too complacent and or being too static with it, I could, you know, we basically have the same help side in place for,
EndUser: I don't know, like what three [DATE-18] now so yeah I think it doesn't look like the most modern or clean site and I think we could probably use the milk and just see what's possible like maybe templates like [PERSON-14] said or just kind of
Agent: Cleaning it up so it looks better let me make a note so we do have So we do have what are called success architects that will sit down with you.
Agent: They'll usually send you some information and maybe one or two recordings. They'll have you review and then they'll sit down and have a session with you.
EndUser: Those
Agent: Now, we're not going to actually be the [PRODUCT-7] designer to redesign your help site. We can't do that, but we can point you to there are a lot of templates. One site I would check out is learnexperiencecloud.com.
Agent: So that is a website that is run by [ORG-1] Success Architect.
Agent: On Experience Cloud So you've probably heard of it called customer communit y in the past since we branded [DATE-18] o as Experience Cloud .
Agent: We'll still use those names interchangeably, whether it's an authenticated or unauthenticated portal. So you might hear it say customer community experience cloud, but peruse around learn experience cloud.com. It's a pretty good site.
Agent: A lot of customers go there, and you can also go just to the [ORG-1] help site and usually get some information there. But happy to try to set up a success architecture
Speaker 5: Session. Like it mentions probably two
Agent: Separate meetings. One that you'll do on your own pace, and then one will set up jointly. Got it.
Agent: I just want to say that, you know, as [PERSON-10] and I have been working with [ORG-18] proper, you know, obviously they've been very different business model than you all.
Agent: And I just want to say they have a lot of respect for you all, how you can run the care business on I know that they kind of wish that they had a model more like yours and try to move to something like that.
Agent: Your side.
Agent: I'm 6,000 agents versus 18. So.
Agent: It's been pretty cool. They've mentioned several times throughout [DATE-18], like being more like Pandora, more like Pandora, they say that a lot. So it's pretty cool to see. So you guys should feel good about that.
Agent: I don't know. We are just a little update. We are things are looking fairly positive on that side for [ORG-19] to service cloud. Nothing's final till it's final, but things are trending in that direction.
Agent: So we'll see what happens, but I don't know if you guys were about to cross behind the scenes or what, but if you did, thank you very much.
Agent: And, you know, they had nothing but good things to say about your
Speaker 5: Team and trying to get to more of a agentless if you have, right?
EndUser: Model
Speaker 5: It's not going to happen [TIME-1], but I say good things about you guys. So share that. That's really nice to you to pass along with birds and. Yeah, we've been.
Speaker 5: You know, given that that's what things are looking like right now, [PERSON-6] and I have been working with those teams more closely and showing them around our environment.
EndUser: And I do think there's just a great deal of potential. So I do feel good about
Agent: What the future may hold there, for sure. I
EndUser: Wanted to give [PERSON-15] and [PERSON-18] a little time to like either talking about what's working or not. Just because we're on here. For sure.
EndUser: Perfectly fine. Sure. I think the automation capabilities that we have very so far are really working fine. That's how we are able to keep our number of agents to pretty low.
EndUser: Most of them are filtered out through spam and also through the service portal. Listeners generally Use that as the source of truth for reaching out for any issues.
EndUser: Most of the issues are resolved then and there itself with our articles that we have shared on the portal.
EndUser: In some scenarios where they really need a manual intervention, that is when they get a ticket log on which the agents do reply to them And then they work with the customers to resolve the issues .
EndUser: Even on that side, we have implemented various automation capabilities, like we will keep a case open for a certain time.
EndUser: And if the customers do not respond back to that, within a given time, we will move it to resolve, let them know, and then move the case to close.
EndUser: All these automations are happening in the back end without ever requiring ensuring that those cases are resolved.
Agent: Any agent to look into those and
EndUser: So, all that manual requirements are taken away.
EndUser: Did you just have some flows?
EndUser: Did you set up a couple of flows and sales parts to do that?
EndUser: Yes, yes, we did. We have certain time-based flows because of which you are able to achieve these departments. The other thing that we kept was that we kept the status of the cases to pretty low.
EndUser: So those cases have very few minimum four or five cases, case status to go through. That actually took away the redundancies in those status values and agents are getting less confused.
EndUser: They really know what to do next and then move on from there. Those values are pretty distinctive and it's very easy to train any new onboarding agent and make them work on the real life cases.
EndUser: You Then we also implemented these [PRODUCT-4] capabilities as [PERSON-15] and [PERSON-6] mentioned.
EndUser: That was an Implementation for about three months on which was implementing these [PERSON-5]-level capabilities to further refine those cases and then bring up these automations as and when the case was being progressed through.
EndUser: So these article recommendations came up in the right time as the agent was working on those cases and then auto response capabilities also were modified.
EndUser: So there has been lot of you know updates that has happened since [DATE-19] . the, uh, to a state where we have reached so far.
EndUser: And that's why, as you mentioned, there were any ongoing issues you would have seen that blank face on all of typical reason was that we have already resolved most of the issues that were, uh, you know, happening over [DATE-18].
Agent: Us. The
EndUser: Um, so that is the reason like we cannot immediately think of any, uh, any issues otherwise they would have been resolved by our team. And to that extent, I mean, that is what I had
Agent: To say at this point of time. Awesome.
Agent: Did you find implementing [WORK_OF_ART-1] some of those features easy to do, medium, hard?
Agent: Can you give it just a little to hear this mother customers ask?
EndUser: I would say medium because it didn't want certain configuration on our side as well. They were not right off the box like you just got a license and start working on it. We had to do customization on that.
EndUser: We had like partnered with [ORG-18], the preferred vendor from on these capabilities.
Agent: [ORG-1] to work
EndUser: We partnered with them for about three two four months and then we went into goalization. There were some hectic discussions in terms of the requirements.
EndUser: We have things, customization, configuration, and that's how we value those in thos e governments . Cool.
Agent: And do you guys as a business feel like you're driving the value you expected from Service Cloud Einstein?
EndUser: I think definitely yes.
EndUser: Yes, we have the, what's it called now?
EndUser: Analytics.
Agent: What's
EndUser: Your deal?
EndUser: Service Analytics app. Everything looks up. And it's got the out of the box numbers for a case classification and require recommendations, case whatever, and knowledge article recommendations. And it's good. I think it looks all positive.
EndUser: I think we might need to.
EndUser: Check the baseline assumptions as far as costs for different actions and things like that to get a better picture.
EndUser: But yeah, I think [PERSON-3], if I could somewhere wrong, we'd like maybe your help to help us determine a one year out ROI on that so we can share that.
EndUser: Is that right, [PERSON-3]?
EndUser: Do you think we
Speaker 5: Need a little help from that?
Speaker 5: Yeah, you know, I want to review the formulas that we have in the analytics studio and how we're deriving some of the cost savings by large, really positive certainly case classification has been the largest cost saving measure.
Speaker 5: By far and away, according to the current assumptions that we have in there. So that's been awesome. That's a huge win, especially taking a large amount of manual work away from one of our premier resources internally.
Speaker 5: So that was amazing in and of itself the case classification. But yeah, you know, we're going to once [DATE-19] rolls around, I really want to take a look at how it's performed over the course of [DATE-32].
Speaker 5: I think it makes sense for us to run those numbers by you all because there could be areas that we aren't factoring in So after I think our initial sweep through those numbers and gathering some of the information and putting it together, we should have a discussion
Agent: About how it's done. Yeah. We have a team that kind of helps us with some of that stuff. So I don't think unfortunately we have a pre-configured spreadsheet just for [ORG-19].
Agent: But I think if as long as we have the data and service analytics app and we look at like case classification reply recommendations or article recommendations or something like that and just plot out how many agents, how many we're getting, and some type of time savings, we can kind
Speaker 5: Of look
EndUser: At it and go, okay, here's what the savings is. It'd be kind of rudimentary, but I think it's a worthwhile exercise to do.
EndUser: I think I was going to say we noticed recently when talking with [ORG-32] that we don't, there's
Agent: Not really any way to report on next best action success or how well it's working or not. That's really tough. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think this is.
Agent: I think the challenges next best action means a lot to a lot of different people depending on whether it's the next of different things
EndUser: Best action or it's an ex best offer or what so that That makes modeling it very difficult.
Speaker 5: Little bit better with. On where the agent, you know, how much does it factor into engagement with the.
EndUser: The case
Speaker 5: The actions themselves, like how often
EndUser: They're being accepted, denied, ignored, those basic, sort of like, yeah, indicators. That'd be a little bit
Agent: More of a hard sell because if you can't measure it, you know, how successful is it and more?
Agent: Yes. That one's always kind of a challenge. I think recommendations to [ORG-21], case classification, a few others.
EndUser: You can track like reply
Speaker 5: But
Agent: Nba is just not as easy.
Speaker 5: So I don't really
Agent: Have a good answer for you on that one. Unfortunately. Good to know we're not missing anything. No, not on that. No. Yeah.
Speaker 5: Are you guys doing anything in generative AI?
EndUser: Does it mean much to
EndUser: You in terms of client service or?
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Like specifically aware. On our side, we're focusing on embedding generative [PRODUCT-4] in the app. The main areas are in the digital channels initially, because that's, I think, where generative [PRODUCT-4] is really going to shine.
Agent: And it's really on, is on service, replies, work summarizations, and creating knowledge articles.
EndUser: Right now, our big focus
Agent: I don't think it's going to turn it out. Is there three areas so that from a service reply is literally just auto generating a contextual service reply.
Agent: In either live chat or not, it's now called Messaging in app and web. If you haven't upgraded yet from live chat to meow, as it's affectionately called, that's something you've probably put on your radar.
Agent: We can get back to that in a second or like email any of the digital channels. So that service replies, they can check for toxicity, they can be approved by the agent first.
Agent: The next generative [PRODUCT-4] where we see a big time savings will be in work summaries. So usually companies will leave [TIME-2] or so to summarize the call.
Agent: In the case notes, now generative [PRODUCT-4] can do that all for you. So you can move your agents on to more calls, serve more people faster and let generative AI do that. work summary.
Agent: And then third one is more around creating a little bit more of like a custom knowledge article that can be sent out to the customer contextual knowledge article .
EndUser: Those are the three areas we're seeing that we just launched back in like summer fall time for. Okay. Yeah, I don't know.
Agent: We interesting to find out we don't have a voice.
Agent: But it would be interesting to like see that at some point. I don't think it's immediately on our road map.
Agent: We're not really this is kind of it's just a probably an interesting discussion for you guys in a client center because it's for me a little bit like There's this huge promise of generative [PRODUCT-4], but it's really going to most likely be geared at the digital channels for a while, and not the voice channel.
Agent: Because if you think about a digital channel, whether it's a chat or a text, it comes in, you have [TIME-3] two formulate response and send it back to them.
Agent: [PERSON-18] might take two two In a voice conversation, the question that initially comes in, the customer could change that question.
EndUser: [TIME-4].
Agent: We get a little bit instantaneously by the time you've already sent the question to [WORK_OF_ART-2] The customer could have changed the question.
Agent: So we're not seeing a big interest on the voice act becaus e The response may not be contextual based on if the custome r Continues to talk while the model is trying to generate a response.
EndUser: Side right now for generative
Agent: So it is all digital channels right no w Maybe someday they'll get to voice in [ORG-28] t you know, real-time or instantaneous, but it's not there ye t. Sure, makes us.
Agent: Anything else we can do?
Agent: Anything?
Agent: I'll send you my information. I'll follow up on the success architect for Experience Cloud. And then in [DATE-21], we'll look at the ROI for Service Cloud Einstein.
Agent: Anything else?
Agent: Send you my information. Feel free to call or email, whatever. Anytime you
Speaker 5: Guys need anything. Yeah, I would say at this point, as you're having conversations with the folks on the [ORG-18] side of the house, please do where it seems relevant. You know, give us a nudge.
Speaker 5: Give us a tap on the shoulder because I think a lot of the things that they will ultimately be wanting to do are things that we could potentially incorporate as well. So while it may not take on immediately.
Agent: Be something we do, your
Speaker 5: You know, I'm certainly want to begin getting that running list of areas in which we can become more sort of cohesive together.
Speaker 5: I, you know, at the end of the road, I want us all to be working together in a similar environment where it makes good relevant sense.
Speaker 5: And so I know there's the potential for us to be in distinct environments as things initially get kicked off, but certainly with that cohesive model in mind
Agent: Is where I'd like to be. Certainly, we are initially, so it seems the replatform is being driven by the IT side right now.
Agent: So those main people I think you probably talked to like [PERSON-18], [PERSON-18] and others who are on IT but then interact with listener care.
Agent: And then on the listener care side, we have met with [PERSON-18] and [PERSON-18] initially. Nothing. fully finalized with them. So they're kind of working internally, kind of like, I would say almost like a triangle here.
Agent: So we're trying to, may, I'll be in [GPE-9] [DATE-28].
Agent: We have a smaller version of our conference called [EVENT-1], where [PERSON-18] sit and we might try to meet up with the launch of the app on [DATE-34]. Not sure if they'll have time.
Agent: Hopefully everything goes smoothly and they will have time but it's all hands on deck. for that team you in the loop.
Speaker 5: [DATE-34]. But yes, happy to keep
Agent: And if I forget or whatever, just ping me too, anytime, but I'm usually pretty good. I just kind of keep it in a room. Yeah, that's good.
EndUser: Thanks [PERSON-10].
Agent: Certainly. All right, if you need
Agent: Thanks everyone.
Speaker 6: Again,
EndUser: Anything,",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. The questions were:

1. ""When we start with what's working, it sounds like for the most part, things are going well. Good to hear your enlightening. Service Cloud Einstein, I think, is always a good level two. Next step for most customers. Some of the other areas we can work on, I think, but they sound like they're going well.""

2. ""Any other things that are going well you want to share?""

3. ""Is there anything not working out well that you need some assistance with?""

These questions were asked to understand the customer's perspective on the current state of their service console, what's working well, and if there are any areas where they need assistance.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer: The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers' needs in the following areas:

1. The customer's current implementation of Service Cloud Einstein and their experience with its features. The sales rep asked if the customer was driving the value they expected from Service Cloud Einstein, but did not delve deeper into specific features or use cases where the customer may need more assistance or guidance.
2. The customer's goals and objectives for their Service Cloud implementation. While the sales rep asked about what was working well and what could be improved, they did not ask about the customer's specific goals or desired outcomes for their use of Service Cloud.
3. The customer's use of generative AI and their interest in incorporating it into their Service Cloud implementation. The sales rep mentioned their focus on embedding generative AI in the app, but did not ask the customer about their current use or interest in this technology.
4. The customer's potential interest in vendor consolidation or simplifying their tech stack. The sales rep mentioned the possibility of bringing the chatbot in-house as a way to reduce costs, but did not ask the customer about their overall tech stack or their interest in consolidating vendors.
5. The customer's experience with the sales rep's organization and their level of satisfaction with the service they have received. The sales rep mentioned that the customer's business model was different from other customers, but did not ask for feedback on their experience with the sales rep's organization or how they could improve their service.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer seems to feel that the seller's product generally meets their needs. They have been using the product since [DATE-1], and have seen significant development over time, including the migration to Lightning and the implementation of Einstein for Service features. They have also seen a positive ROI from Service Cloud Einstein, particularly with case classification. However, they do mention that there are areas where the product could be improved, such as with next best action success tracking and generative AI in voice channels. Overall, the customer appears to be satisfied with the product but is looking for ways to optimize its use and address any gaps in functionality.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""Did you find implementing Service Cloud Einstein some of those features easy to do, medium, hard?"" The customer responded by saying it was medium, and explained the customization and configuration they had to do with a partner. The customer seemed engaged as they provided specific details about their implementation process.
2. ""Do you guys as a business feel like you're driving the value you expected from Service Cloud Einstein?"" The customer responded positively, mentioning the Service Analytics app and its usefulness in tracking case classification and recommendations. They also mentioned the potential need for help in determining a one-year out ROI.
3. ""Are you guys doing anything in generative AI?"" The customer asked for clarification about the term ""generative AI"" and seemed engaged as the sales rep explained the focus on digital channels and the potential future of generative AI in voice channels. The customer also shared their current focus on digital channels."
video_14192_167_6qr3y000000saqDAAQ,"EndUser: So welcome in guys. Thank you so much, [PERSON-1], for walking through the rain. [PERSON-2], I appreciate you joining in virtually. We'd love to just start with a quick round of intros. Obviously, I am not [PERSON-3].
EndUser: I don't look like her, right?
EndUser: You guys have a new accounting here and we're happy to Support it. I think it'll be best just quick round of intros. Maybe starting with [PERSON-1], love to.
EndUser: Just hear what's top of mind and also just expectations that you would love to get out of this meeting Well temple like to see I know for bank.
EndUser: Well, I Think what we're looking to get is like everything's in with Enterprise grid just to see now And we bought and paid all the money but the extra money How do we get the most out of it, right?
EndUser: So I think we had some things in a slide deck that Either I don't know if it came from [PERSON-4] or [PERSON-5] at the time in [DATE-1], so we want to put some of those in a forecast for [DATE-2] to implement.
EndUser: We're more [ORG-1] focused, so we want to make sure we put those in place. [PERSON-2], feel free to introduce and comment.
EndUser: Yeah, so [PERSON-2] engineering. Yeah, we. Yeah, we, I think, I think we. We saw that [PERSON-6], we didn't really, we saw that it was in beta, we saw that you could join.
EndUser: And I think [PERSON-1] had brought it up to me that [ORG-2] was doing this AI thing.
EndUser: And I was like, and when I started to look for how I turned it on, I saw that it was kind of still in beta.
EndUser: But yeah, we've been going through some [ORG-1] practices and locking things down with the, now that we're on the Enterprise grid. And yeah, anything that helps us utilize the tool better. You know, I
EndUser: Love it. Yeah. And that will definitely be some things we touch on, especially with [PERSON-7], being on the call. Quick intro on my side. Slack 8E here, now obviously supporting bankwell.
EndUser: I've been with [ORG-2] for about coming up on [DATE-3] here. I was previously at twilio and [ORG-3] prior.
EndUser: And to be honest, for me as a seller, I think selling comes easier when you really believe in the product. And [ORG-3] and [PRODUCT-1] were huge adopters in [ORG-2] shops.
EndUser: And hence, that's why I said, let me join here. It's going to sell like hotcakes, but. As we all know [DATE-4], nothing's sold like hotcakes, but probably hotcakes itself as a mess of bagels.
EndUser: And so now really excited to work with the team here. And the biggest thing is get that quicker time to value out of your investment [DATE-4], obviously, into Enterprise grade.
EndUser: And now as we evaluate potentially [ORG-4], [PERSON-4], why don't you take it over?
Agent: Sure, I'll turn my camera back on to introduce myself. [PERSON-8] definitely spoke with the team once or twice before. Nice to see you again. I'm a solution engineer here at [ORG-2].
Agent: Been here for [DATE-5] and really excited to share with you some more of [PRODUCT-2] that's come out helping you get the value out of grid and showing you what it's going to look like.
Agent: Over time as well. So we're super excited about it. It's been a huge launch within [DATE-6] internally and externally. So thanks for having us.
EndUser: Awesome. Great. Thanks.
EndUser: So to kick it off, I wanted to just start high level of the new V that's playing into the question, okay, [PERSON-9], why [ORG-4]?
EndUser: Why is it introduced to the market now?
EndUser: Right.
EndUser: So I want to start high level first and then we're going to get into, you know, the medium bones of the actual But I think we can all agree, first and foremost, we are experiencing one of the biggest technology shifts of our lifetime.
EndUser: There is a huge opportunity for massive time savings, increased proficiency, and Productivity through generative [PRODUCT-2].
EndUser: And I just want to start as I think, this is kind of the momentum that we see, not just internally, but throughout the whole market.
EndUser: And on the board here in the purple, with all of that huge opportunity, though, we can all agree that for many businesses, those, those, those time to value those value points, it still feels a little out of reach.
EndUser: And I think, you know, generally, I really is that new inflection point for all businesses.
EndUser: And it's top of mind for all leaders, you know, how do we get ahead of the curve?
EndUser: How do we stay competitive with this new technology coming to the market?
EndUser: And while [DATE-7] was a great [DATE-8] for [PRODUCT-2], it really still is [DATE-9].
EndUser: There's so much being figured out and there isn't a clear roadmap on how to overcome some of these hurdles, some of these challenges.
EndUser: And so to tally that up in contrast, how we're approaching [PRODUCT-2] is a little bit differently at SLAP.
EndUser: I'm going to be honest, [PERSON-2], as I was looking through the account channel back and forth with [ORG-5], there was huge interest in the beta and this.
EndUser: And I think first and foremost, [ORG-2] could have easily launched [ORG-6].
EndUser: If our focus was getting it into the market ASAP, but instead we want to take our time, we want to keep working our large language models to the point where we feel confident of what we're actually bringing to the market.
EndUser: And so I wanted to lay out three approaches that create the foundation behind our new General AI solution, which obviously is called [ORG-4].
EndUser: And the first approach is [PRODUCT-2] should be for everyone, right?
EndUser: You shouldn't need to be an engineer to use [PRODUCT-2]. And so [ORG-2] is introducing [PRODUCT-2] in a guided experience and where it's embedded into the actual user experience. So it's simple, accessible, intuitive for wider audience.
EndUser: Second, [PRODUCT-2] needs to be trustworthy, right?
EndUser: We're seeing a lot of widely used [PRODUCT-2] tools in the market on the internet [DATE-10], and they rely heavily on public web data. We operate in a black box.
EndUser: There's no citations behind like where the answer's coming from and like you mentioned [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2], Security is top of mind, right?
EndUser: Like we need to know references, we need to know where all of this is coming from.
EndUser: And so with [ORG-2], we're building our [PRODUCT-2] based on, in theory, your company knowledge, right?
EndUser: The more you use [ORG-2], the more implicit knowledge there is in all the conversations and all the sharing of ideas, decision-making, issue-solving.
EndUser: And when that becomes the basis for generative AI, our large language models can now generate outputs that are deeply relevant for bank well. And then third, [PRODUCT-2] needs to be secure.
EndUser: When you use third-party LLMs, you're really at the mercy of the provider. You're just kind of blingly blindly trusting that they're going to protect and secure your data properly.
EndUser: But instead, for [ORG-2], we chose to host our own LLMs directly in [ORG-2], keeping our data secure and your data secure private in [ORG-2].
EndUser: Where it already lives [DATE-10], right?
EndUser: So Long story short is all the [ORG-1] measures that you've come to understand is existing in Enterprise grid. That's one-to-one with [ORG-4].
EndUser: And so these three approaches combine, it delivers the generative [PRODUCT-2] solution, and we've all come together to learn more about today, which obviously is called [ORG-4], that all our customers can trust.
EndUser: And so before we get into the medium bones, I'd love to just open it up to [PERSON-1], [PERSON-2].
EndUser: When you guys were asking for the beta and this and that, what were some expectations?
EndUser: What were some things?
EndUser: Like when you share [ORG-4], what were some like, It would be awesome if we saw this. We'd love to just get some color on some expectations, some preconceived notions you might have had about the potential add-on.
EndUser: Well, to me, [PRODUCT-2] is different with any company, like what the offer is.
EndUser: So to me, it's more like, okay, what are you gonna do in AI in right now and what can you offer us?
EndUser: So I didn't have a specific functionality in mind because, I can ask do you have this because they know, right?
EndUser: So then like, what do you have?
EndUser: So I think that's what the conversation for me was all about. Perfect.
EndUser: [PERSON-2], any color you want to add to that?
EndUser: Now I don't think I had any real expectation for it. I just was more interested in what exactly it was doing.
EndUser: Perfect. Love that.
EndUser: So to the medium bones, right?
EndUser: These are at top of mind the first three main features that make up our solution [DATE-10]. So we have search answers, we have channel recaps and thread summaries.
EndUser: And so like I can talk about it, we can go through the bullet list and all of that. But I think, you know, this is where [PERSON-4]'s magic comes into play.
EndUser: Rather than telling you about it, let's actually just go right into the demo and just see it.
EndUser: And at any point, [PERSON-2], as [PERSON-7] walks through the demo, feel free to just interrupt us, be like, hey, this looks awesome.
EndUser: Can it maybe do this?
EndUser: Or where is this coming from?
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: Like, we want this to be a conversation through and through. So [PERSON-7], I'll stop sharing and, you know, feel free to take it away from here.
Agent: Fantastic. Thank you.
Agent: All right, make sure you can see my screen, right?
Agent: We have cumulus at the top left. Yeah, perfect. Fantastic. OK, so we're going to kind of go in order of what [PERSON-9] was discussing as far as [ORG-4] goes.
Agent: We're going to look at summary channel recaps, thread summaries, and then searching summarization as well. So that's the meat and the potatoes of [ORG-4] at the moment. So if you have channels.
Agent: That have a lot of data in them and someone is out on leave or they are a new hire could be an example.
Agent: They can come into that channel so we're in a specific account channel right now and we have the one click AI button at the top right.
Agent: So I say one click because in one click [PRODUCT-2] can summarize unreads or [DATE-11]. We can also do custom date range as well.
Agent: Was there a question?
Agent: I just heard a little bit of feedback.
EndUser: Sorry. Oh, no problem.
Agent: Alrighty. So I can choose a specific date range, you know, back from [DATE-1] to [DATE-10], and I can go ahead and select summarize.
Agent: [ORG-4] is going to take a second to take the channel data and then be able to spit out a summary of the, you know, highlights of that specific channel.
Agent: It's going to give us the date, the total amount of conversations, amount of people in that, and then it will also give us a kind of a breakdown there in You can see how it's outlined, you know, each section.
Agent: It's also going to be able to cite as well people and areas of the channel where this information was brought from. So you can see we can expand a little bit more to kind of see more details.
Agent: And then when we hover over that site, it can take us into that area of that channel. And we'll see that along the way [DATE-10] as well.
Agent: The other part of summarization isn't just summarizing a channel, but summarizing a thread. So if I jump into another channel that has a thread response that's pretty detailed here, it's a lot of words there.
Agent: Let's go ahead and summarize that as well. So again, one click, very easy.
Agent: [ORG-4] is going to then take the information of that thread, summarize it for us, provide us more detail, cite to where that specific piece of information was found, so you can navigate to that.
Agent: This is helpful when we see our customers, especially when we think about maybe, you know, Cases or incidents where a lot of discussion was happening and you need a case resolution summary, and [PRODUCT-2] can summarize that.
Agent: So just kind of giving, you know, an example to where this context could lie.
Agent: That last piece is going to be the search aspect of [ORG-4].
Agent: So if I jump into our search bar and if I'm asking a question, what is the first step of establishing domicile in [GPE-1]?
Agent: As an example, [ORG-2] is going to do what it does, and it's going to search all results that kind of match that specific search.
Agent: But now what it's going to do is take those results and put it in a [PRODUCT-2] result. So... Keep in mind, we also ask this question in natural language.
Agent: So what is the first step?
Agent: X, Y, and [PERSON-10] Instead of first step or [GPE-2] [GPE-1], how we typically search [DATE-11].
Agent: So you can ask it in natural language and then in natural language, it's going to respond back to you having what the first step actually is.
Agent: And then again, citing it and you pull that side up in thread as well.
Agent: So I hope you were able to see in what I think is really great about it too, is trout that the adoption can really happen at scale. It's all integrated in [ORG-2]. It's nothing extra.
Agent: It's a one-click tool within a channel, within a thread, and within the search capabilities as well. So it's really easy to use and like allow users to adopt it pretty easily there.
Agent: And then to [PERSON-9]'s point as well, the biggest thing is trust here. So this is built on that enterprise, you know, grade platform. So you can ensure or we can enjoy that the [ORG-1] and compliance is there.
Agent: And we do have that closed AI environment. So all of the data that's being pulled in your searches and in those thread and channel summaries are not leaving your environment. They're not being shared with an LLM.
Agent: Other companies are. anything of that nature. And we don't train those all LLMs.
Agent: It's simply using the data to kind of you know source it and bring it to the front of the customer or the front of the members. Excuse me.
Agent: Any questions?
Agent: Go ahead. Are the queries originating from, I
EndUser: Guess, like my [ORG-2] app and does it go to, like, does it then take the data or is it continuously pulling the data so it could do faster searches or faster [PRODUCT-2] responses?
Agent: So to answer that question, I have actually pulled up and I can share this with you after as well so you can review it.
Agent: So this kind of speaks to the data flow of it and when it like leaves like the [ORG-2] and pulling and all that stuff.
Agent: So if this would be a good diagram for you to look at we can share this with you after the call.
EndUser: Great.
EndUser: Well if I summarize a channel that's been going on for [DATE-9].
EndUser: Is it going to <inaudible> on that?
EndUser: Yeah. Great question. So because I know I saw you could do like just [DATE-11], but like what if you click just summarize on a channel has been around for a long time.
EndUser: Like it would have to summarize like.
EndUser: Conversations, right?
EndUser: Like.
Agent: Yeah, it would. It would have to summarize all of that. And actually, that is a great point. And I want to get some clarification on the, the date range there.
Agent: You know, how, how far back, but what it does do is it queries all of their relevant data.
Agent: So it's not going to <inaudible>, but it is going to bring forth data that's new and relevant and old and relevant as well. And that's why we offer the citations.
Agent: So someone can click on that citation and see, okay, if this was from [DATE-11], [DATE-14], this response, maybe it's not as relevant, let's dig a little bit deeper. But that is a very good question.
Agent: So. I know it's not going to <inaudible>. I know it can query . you know, a lot of data on the back end. But let me get some clarification on like what that date range is.
Agent: I just wasn't sure if like you'd click it and then it'd be like waiting, waiting, waiting.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: Like.
Agent: It's a fair question [PERSON-2]. It is. It definitely is a fair question. And we can take it as a takeaway to see what some of the companies that have gone through the pilot have experienced.
Agent: I have not seen anything where they've experienced a lag in the response regardless of how large that channel actually was, how much data was in that channel. We can do a little [GPE-3]
Agent: Yeah, I was wondering if it like makes the decision like, all right, it's been [TIME-1]. Let me give them what I got
EndUser: Kind of thing, right?
EndUser: Ok, yeah,
EndUser: Fair. Opening up to [PERSON-11], obviously, channel, thread, search answers, top of mind, is there one that sticks out as, OK, this could be immediate time to value when it comes to, Productivity efficiencies.
EndUser: I just want to kind of see where your head as you visually just, you know, saw what makes up the solution.
EndUser: I mean, I think the main search and the summary of being able to summarize a channel or at least maybe the last, I don't know if [DATE-11] makes sense, but like, if it could, If there was an option to summarize the last conversation in a channel where it analyzed the channel and being like, there was a conversation happening here, and it just takes that last conversation and analyzes that.
EndUser: I think that would be a useful toggle switch.
EndUser: [DATE-19], but there might be, and then it would, I guess, would summarize any conversation of [DATE-11], but really, like, a lot of times, like, I'll go into a channel and they'll be, like, 11 new messages, and instead of reading through them to be able to just say, summarize that, Okay.
Agent: Right. Yeah.
Agent: So can I ask you a question?
Agent: So are most of your conversations happening like that in channel rather than in a thread?
Agent: So if somebody starts a conversation in channel, the responses are not being threaded. Correct.
EndUser: Okay. Yes. Like the most threads I've ever used has been in the channel that we use with you guys. Like, because you guys, you guys use threads all the time. And Everywhere else is like we don't. Okay.
EndUser: We just. Yeah, so I think the.
Agent: I think the vision of thread is where a conversation on a specific topic could happen within a channel, and that's what makes the thread summary so powerful, is that you can do exactly what you are explaining, [PERSON-2], within that specific thread.
Agent: So we can take that to our product team as a possible gap or request
EndUser: And see if other customers have also requested that as well. I mean I... I kind of find threads sometimes hard to follow and find that I'd lose things inside of threads.
EndUser: Whereas, whereas if it just happens in the channel, I always see it. But sometimes I need to be responding to thread and then I'll miss it. Right.
EndUser: You know?
EndUser: Not that this will completely change your life, [PERSON-2], but when you do reply in thread, there is a little toggle button on the bottom that says, reply in the channel.
EndUser: So that you're applying in threat and then it visibly shows it as like a line item below it. It's you said, yeah, so it seems like you're familiar with it.
EndUser: But that And to be sure, do you also have your notifications turned on to receive notifications when there are responses in a thread?
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah. He does that what I just said because people miss it if he doesn't reply. That's interesting. Particularly [PERSON-2]. No, but that's what I was saying. I was.
EndUser: Like relies on the person sending the message to also do that, right?
EndUser: So it's not really because I don't miss what I'm typing. I miss what they're typing. So they don't click replying channel when they reply on the thread. Sometimes it gets buried inside the thread.
EndUser: And sometimes it's not that I don't see them. It's just that I'll go try to find what they were saying later. And then I should so if the if the [PRODUCT-2] search. helps with that. It does.
EndUser: And that's a big use case because a lot of times it'll be like, I know that I saw this, it was in a thread and I just can't find where it is in the thread, right?
EndUser: Yeah, no. But to your point, [PERSON-2], I think as for me, right, because we've internally released [ORG-4] for [DATE-21] now so that we can, you know, have built on LLM.
EndUser: For me as a personal user now, I first always start with just a certain.
EndUser: And then if I can't find that search, then I might go into the channel that I think has the information I'm looking at, and then maybe do a channel summary or do this.
EndUser: But I think for me, just intuitively, it makes sense to just search it first and see if it pulls it. I'll give you an example.
EndUser: Just earlier today, a customer was asking, hey, does [ORG-7] in attempts from, like, per se, like [GPE-4], right?
EndUser: Like because it's one of those countries that are in a data sensitive region. And so when I don't know the answer, I just immediately search in [ORG-2].
EndUser: And before [ORG-4], right, you just go through cascades of results and just kind of look to see you.
EndUser: But now with the search answer, right?
EndUser: Like boom, it pops up something. And then it might be the answer. It might not. And then back to your whole thing, [PERSON-2], about a top date range. Like I found one from [DATE-26].
EndUser: So, you know, that's [DATE-19]. But it was confident that this was the answer as of [DATE-26].
EndUser: And it pulled it, you know, within [TIME-2], right?
EndUser: So. I think the Workflow behind how [ORG-4] can be utilized, it's gonna be up to the preference of the user for sure, but to your point, it might just be remedied by a simple search.
EndUser: Yeah, I think the search feature is going to be huge.
EndUser: Love that.
EndUser: [PERSON-1], any other comments on the three or just any further context you wanted?
EndUser: Is it on for everyone once we've been turning this on?
EndUser: Yes. It's on for all 117 contracted users you guys have in your contract.
EndUser: Can we turn it off for some people or not?
EndUser: Is that a potential situation?
EndUser: I'm just asking the question.
EndUser: Ok. [PERSON-4], do you have any insight into if they could turn it off for specific users?
Agent: Do not think so. But while we're chit chatting, let me pull up a couple of things and see if I can get a clear answer there.
EndUser: Real-time [ORG-4] usage on [PERSON-4]'s blog. Love it. Okay, awesome. So we saw the features that make up the solution.
EndUser: And I wanted to, was there anything you wanted to provide in the next slide here?
EndUser: Do you think we could go on to the kind of the value points or some of the ROI metrics?
EndUser: I think we can go on. I kind of touched on some of this within the demonstration here. So, yeah, I think we're good to move on to the next slide. Perfect.
EndUser: And so, you know, I think the solution can only be as impactful as it is in the context of bankwell, right?
EndUser: Because every [ORG-2] workspace looks a little different. And so contextualizing it into the actual data that lives in
EndUser: Really high level, but you know, these are some of the numbers that just in cumulatively speaking, right?
EndUser: We're looking at 94k plus channels over a million point seven million messages, 64,000 files shared. Right, you guys are contracted for 109 users on a [DATE-19] basis, active users of 54.
EndUser: So when it comes to adoption, we're looking great.
EndUser: Over 116 searches per week, and this is pre [ORG-4], right?
EndUser: So just giving you the context into what that looks like.
EndUser: And so, You know, with some of the companies, we have piloted out to [ORG-4] and coming back with some of the metrics we see in the data from that usage.
EndUser: This is, and please, please, please take us with a grain of salt, right?
EndUser: You know, I think a day we're not healing to blind, but just to give some contextualized data from what we've seen with the pilot users in light of the benchmark we're looking at, which is 64 users for bank well.
EndUser: This is some of the metrics that we're predicting that will be time to value ROI coming from the usage of [ORG-4], broken down by the three features, right?
EndUser: Channel, thread, search.
EndUser: And this is just at a high level, how many hours back can we save through your, in your workers day to day, so that those hours back can be used for high level projects?
EndUser: Generating revenue, generating activities, right?
EndUser: So just, it's like [TIME-3] that are spent going from this and that, right?
EndUser: [PERSON-2] said, he's in this thread, but he doesn't know what's going on in this thread, right?
EndUser: If that could be remedied through [ORG-4], what are some of [TIME-4] gained?
EndUser: And then that [ORG-8], that stands for full-time equivalent. So on an annualized basis, we're looking at, you know, plus 8,000 potential. [TIME-5] gained back to the business.
EndUser: And that just is equivalent to three full-time equivalent employees in terms of [TIME-6] base.
EndUser: And this is just to kind of contextualize, like, this is what we're looking for, or this is how we're understanding potential time to value in this investment on top of already the data that's living in [ORG-2] [DATE-10].
EndUser: And just one other slide, this is more in the dollar senses, right?
EndUser: Potential annualized benefit. Obviously, we'd all love to save, you know, [MONEY-1] on an [DATE-26] basis. As a [ORG-2], I'm going to say this is truly a glass half full. Look at the product.
EndUser: As a user of [ORG-2] AI [DATE-10], when there's really, you know, just extrinsic and just intricate questions I'm getting from customers, now I just default to [ORG-4] search.
EndUser: And just see if maybe [ORG-4], [ORG-9] in the past, has asked that question already, right?
EndUser: So we're using the knowledge that already exists in your workspace for the betterment of the business.
EndUser: I'd love to get your [MONEY-2], [PERSON-1], when it comes to time to value, when you guys look at ROI for your investments as a leader at [ORG-10].
EndUser: What are some of the things you're looking for that define time to value?
EndUser: And this is what we're looking for out of our investments. I mean, to be honest, like none of these metrics really matter to me because I just want the technology functionality.
EndUser: It's like, if we went [DATE-26] and not did this, but we're paying for it. That's where I think there's no ROI to that. Right.
EndUser: So that's why, for what we pay for to date, I want to make sure we have, we understand what we need to implement and how to get there. Yep. Perfect. Awesome.
EndUser: So, you know, just that high level right [TIME-7]. That's on average through our pilot users.
EndUser: Where does [TIME-8] saved coming from using the search using the summaries?
EndUser: And that's just what's making up the bulk of the story of what's behind [ORG-4] and what it can be for the business potentially for bank well, right?
EndUser: And then just on the Question you had of like Implementation or just like up to speed literally [PERSON-1] It's just turned on with the click of button, right?
EndUser: There's no Implementation Start-up. It's just it's in your it's in your [ORG-2] work. I get that.
EndUser: It's just more like a you just have to actually do it right for sure So in terms of the presentation, that's really all we had prepared. We didn't want to, you know, identify slides.
EndUser: Hopefully it wasn't too much to digest. Well, it's not really like you don't have to sell it to us. We were asking for it. So turn it on.
EndUser: Who turns it on?
EndUser: I guess that's the option. Yeah. So I mean, obviously, because it's an add-on, right, we would be having a potential order for, we would have to look at the list pricing.
EndUser: So it would be one-to-one match with your 111 users that is contracted. And then the list [ORG-11] for [ORG-4] is on a [DATE-19] basis, we're looking at $[MONEY-3] per user per month. So annualized, that's $[MONEY-4] per user.
EndUser: On a list [ORG-11] basis for your hundred users, we would look at 24,000 for list price.
EndUser: So there is a cost to it?
EndUser: There is. I thought there wasn't a cost to it. I don't know. There is a cost to it. Okay. So I guess like, okay, that's not really why we have this conversation. It's just turning on. Okay.
EndUser: So then that's what I, that makes more sense now. Okay. I'm just like, if I don't know, I completely get it. It's like, turn it on guys.
EndUser: Like, what's the point?
EndUser: All right, so if there's a cost to it, then I need to. That's a difficult conversation, then don't turn it on yet. Don't worry.
EndUser: We wouldn't turn it on without a review pricing, because there's not really much developing as well.
EndUser: Do we want this?
EndUser: Because any of those metrics that you're showing, that's not going to help sell it. I mean, it's not a case of cost either. But yeah, just send me a quote that I can review. Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: [PERSON-2], any questions on your end?
EndUser: No, I'm good.
EndUser: Perfect. Well, it's clearly, I thought, yeah, either way, we settled the smoke. But it's good to be well informed with what's going on here. So I'm glad there was no hiccups.
Agent: It's real quick, just as a clarifying piece when, you know, [PERSON-9] puts that together and shares pricing and whatnot. It is, and [PERSON-9] correct me if I'm wrong, but a one-to-one license and [ORG-2] at the moment.
Agent: To your question on being able to turn it off for users, right now it doesn't look like there is that option, but I'm going to dig a little bit and see if it's on the roadmap and see if it's a question that other customers have come up with as well.
Agent: So I'll let you know there.
Agent: Just to go back for a second on We were talking about kind of like the recency search and how far back does that date range work and how does the tool kind of access that information and respond.
Agent: Just so you know, the team, our product team is working to boost newer searches and that will get better over time as well. But the summarization doesn't necessarily favor.
Agent: One or the other whether it was recent or, you know, a post from a while back. And at the moment, we don't have a hard limit on how far back a custom date range can go.
Agent: But we may be adding one. We kind of, you know, think that maybe after like two years' worth of channel messages is not relevance, maybe [DATE-17] to present something of that nature.
Agent: So keep that in mind as well. It was just something that we had discussed in the conversation [DATE-10].
EndUser: But if I do a search on the channel with like, I don't know, a million, you know, Slack messages, it's not going to make me wait [TIME-9] for a response, right?
EndUser: Okay. I see what you're saying. So, somehow it somehow determines when it should just start giving answers on things and It doesn't just continually be like, hold on, you got to put everything together. Yeah.
EndUser: Through all million text messages or Slack messages yet.
Agent: Yeah, there's not a latency there. Have not seen that specific to a million.
Agent: Pieces of conversation or whatnot, I mean, I'd have to get the specifics there. But yeah, I tend to agree that there's not that latency there.
EndUser: Yeah, so there's something in it that says, okay, I'm just going to start giving answers or orgs fast enough to go through whatever it needs to go through in a reasonable time frame is really well done.
EndUser: Gotcha.
EndUser: My question lies in things like we have to license for everyone in Enterprise grid [DATE-10], right?
EndUser: I couldn't be like 59. Right. OK, so that was step one.
EndUser: And step two was like, can I, if I license for everyone, can I turn it off for some people?
EndUser: But you said maybe not or not right now. What a reason. It's not TV.
EndUser: But is that like a realistic situation?
EndUser: Because I mean, the only people that would really benefit right now is IT, because we use it. maybe like a rich security, we don't have retail altusing it.
EndUser: There's not a lot of custom channels for the rest of the business, right [PERSON-2]?
EndUser: You'd be surprised that some of the other departments have made some channels.
EndUser: I haven't done a full analysis of it, but to your point, yeah, I would think that the majority of people who would use the features of that [ORG-4] provides are going to be us Security and maybe a couple other [ORG-2] power users, if you will.
EndUser: I think it's just a vibe. So I mean, like, it's not like a huge justification. That is like the huge output from cost. You're talking about 117k or something. Right. We're talking list [ORG-11] 26. Yeah.
EndUser: You know how that game goes?
EndUser: Yeah. We know that game. But I think to your point, it's a great point.
EndUser: The usefulness to across scale, and I think back to the point, right?
EndUser: At [DATE-24], as far as the data shows, 62 [DATE-19] active users, so there is healthy usage, right?
EndUser: Like if we're looking at 44 [DATE-19] active users, then it'd be like, okay, well, but at scale, and even if you're an active user, just someone just send a chance to one-on-one.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, but yeah, I mean that's fine. But those people only do one-on-one singular chats like, hey, like, you're like, you're not going to see any benefit from this [PRODUCT-2].
EndUser: How do we zero benefit?
EndUser: It's the people that are heavier users or are active in channels or part of channels that want to see the value there. Those are the added benefits for sure.
EndUser: Yeah, and then also just long term right the more that channel adoption happens right the more data that lives in Slack public channels the more like it's just going to compound on the the value
EndUser: Long term that's an excellent question does the [PRODUCT-2] go through [ORG-11]. Or does it only go through public well or does it only go through channels like does it.
EndUser: Does it search your DMs or your [ORG-9] groups?
EndUser: The best way to understand it, [PERSON-2], it goes by the user to which, like, so for me, right?
EndUser: If I'm part of multiple private channels, my answer still will pull from those private channel DMs and private channel.
EndUser: Okay, so if I have a [ORG-9] group with like two or three other people, it's still going to search through those for me.
EndUser: Exactly. Because you're... You're entitled right to your the data. Yeah, it's fine. Okay. Just wanted to clarify that because because if you didn't do that, I'd be like, wow. Exactly.
EndUser: It's a huge case a lot, right?
EndUser: Absolutely. Perfect.
EndUser: Any, any last questions?
EndUser: Is there a way to demo it?
EndUser: Is there a way to burn it on for like a trial period and then you can show it off.
EndUser: [PERSON-4], you want to take that one?
EndUser: It's a great question.
Agent: There is. So we do have a [DATE-26] trial. [PERSON-9], I can work with you on the details, and then we can get back to the team on that. But yeah, we do have a [DATE-26] trial period.
EndUser: Ok. That's not a curiosity. Again, send me to pricing. Yes. We'll work on that if there's a trial option, just to make sure that we like it. You can revisit that as well. You got it.
EndUser: You got to eat one has to be able to before buying 11 of them. You know what's that you want to try [DATE-26] before buying the dozen. So I get it. I didn't buy the dozen.
EndUser: You get your [ORG-2] to get a bite. It's a lot of bagels. All right.
EndUser: I take pride in ending meetings earlier, right?
EndUser: I want to respect your time. So [PERSON-2], thank you so much. [PERSON-4], thank you so much. Thank you.
EndUser: And we're [ORG-2] away, right [PERSON-1]?
EndUser: Obviously [PERSON-2], you guys are in the [ORG-2] channel. So any other questions that come to mind, [PERSON-4] and I will be at the [FAC-1]. Great. Thanks so much, [PERSON-11], [PERSON-2]. We will be signing off. Thank you. Thank you.
EndUser: Bye team. Bye.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if the correct decision maker was on the call. The customer mentions that they are from Bankwell and the seller mentions that they are a Slack 8E supporting Bankwell. However, the customer's boss is mentioned, but not involved in the call. The agreed-upon next steps include sending a quote for the product and discussing a trial period.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive, but they had concerns about the cost and wanted to review a quote before proceeding. They also asked about the possibility of a trial period to test the product before purchasing. Overall, they were interested in the product and its features, but needed more information about the pricing and trial options.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""When you guys were asking for the beta and this and that, what were some expectations? What were some things? Like when you share [ORG-4], what were some like, It would be awesome if we saw this. We'd love to just get some color on some expectations, some preconceived notions you might have had about the potential add-on.""
2. ""Is it on for everyone once we've been turning this on? Yes. It's on for all 117 contracted users you guys have in your contract. Can we turn it off for some people or not? I'm just asking the question.""
3. ""What are some of the things you're looking for that define time to value? And this is what we're looking for out of our investments. I mean, to be honest, like none of these metrics really matter to me because I just want the technology functionality.""

In each of these questions, the sales rep is trying to understand the customer's needs and expectations better, and the customer seems more engaged in providing their thoughts and feedback. This kind of engagement is a positive sign for the sales process, as it indicates that the customer is interested and invested in the conversation.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of the product, focusing on the benefits of using the product such as time savings, increased productivity, and the ability to stay competitive with new technology. They also highlighted the unique features of their product, such as the guided experience, trustworthiness, and security. However, there were a few missed opportunities where the sales rep could have further emphasized the value of their product. For example, when the customer mentioned that they didn't have any specific functionality in mind, the sales rep could have provided examples of how the product can be used to solve specific business problems. Additionally, when the customer expressed concerns about the cost of the product, the sales rep could have highlighted the potential return on investment and long-term value that the product can provide.

Answer to this question is unclear:

* Whether the sales rep had previously provided specific examples of how the product can be used to solve business problems
* The customer's specific budget constraints and decision-making process for purchasing the product
* The customer's level of familiarity with similar products and their understanding of the value that such products can provide.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were related to cost and licensing. The customer was under the impression that the product was free, but later found out there was a cost associated with it. They also asked if it was possible to license the product for all users and then turn it off for some, to which the seller responded that it might not be possible at the moment. The customer expressed that the usefulness of the product would mainly be for IT and security teams, and not all 117 contracted users. They also had questions about the search functionality, such as how far back the search could go and whether it could search through private channels, DMs, and group chats.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""When you guys were asking for the beta and this and that, what were some expectations? What were some things? Like when you share [ORG-4], what were some like, It would be awesome if we saw this. We'd love to just get some color on some expectations, some preconceived notions you might have had about the potential add-on.""
2. ""I just was more interested in what exactly it was doing. So I didn't have a specific functionality in mind because, I can ask do you have this because they know, right? So then like, what do you have?""
3. ""So to the medium bones, right? These are at top of mind the first three main features that make up our solution [DATE-10]. So we have search answers, we have channel recaps and thread summaries. And so like I can talk about it, we can go through the bullet list and all of that. But I think, you know, this is kind of the momentum that we see, not just internally, but throughout the whole market. And on the board here in the purple, with all of that huge opportunity, though, we can all agree that for many businesses, those, those, those time to value those value points, it still feels a little out of reach.""
4. ""And it's top of mind for all leaders, you know, how do we get ahead of the curve? How do we stay competitive with this new technology coming to the market?""
5. ""And while [DATE-7] was a great [DATE-8] for [PRODUCT-2], it really still is [DATE-9]. There's so much being figured out and there isn't a clear roadmap on how to overcome some of these hurdles, some of these challenges.""
6. ""And so to tally that up in contrast, how we're approaching [PRODUCT-2] is a little bit differently at SLAP. I'm going to be honest, [PERSON-2], as I was looking through the account channel back and forth with [ORG-5], there was huge interest in the beta and this. And I think first and foremost, [ORG-2] could have easily launched [ORG-6]. If our focus was getting it into the market ASAP, but instead we want to take our time, we want to keep working our large language models to the point where we feel confident of what we're actually bringing to the market.""
7. ""And so I wanted to lay out three approaches that create the foundation behind our new General AI solution, which obviously is called [ORG-4]. And the first approach is [PRODUCT-2] should be for everyone, right? You shouldn't need to be an engineer to use [PRODUCT-2]. And so [ORG-2] is introducing [PRODUCT-2] in a guided experience and where it's embedded into the actual user experience. So it's simple, accessible, intuitive for wider audience.""
8. ""And it's top of mind for all leaders, you know, how do we get ahead of the curve? How do we stay competitive with this new technology coming to the market?""
9. ""And so to tally that up in contrast, how we're approaching [PRODUCT-2] is a little bit differently at SLAP.

10. ""I mean, to be honest, like none of these metrics really matter to me because I just want the technology functionality. It's like, if we went [DATE-26] and not did this, but we're paying for it. That's where I think there's no ROI to that. Right.""
11. ""So, you know, just that high level right [TIME-7]. That's on average through our pilot users. Where does [TIME-8] saved coming from using the search using the summaries?

video_14193_167_6qr3y000000scjiAAA,"Agent: I'm <inaudible> more that you want.
Agent: Perfect, it's on. All right, perfect.
EndUser: So I'm gonna Mention what my angle is or what my dream right now so We are supporting the [GPE-1] customers as our core customer, but in addition to that, we keep growing and growing within the international markets.
Agent: Is
EndUser: So right now, we have for core, for everything that we have in [ORG-1], we have [NORP-1], we have [NORP-2], we have [NORP-3], we have [NORP-4], we have [NORP-5], we have [NORP-6], and we have [NORP-7].
EndUser: These are just some because some of them, some of them with more volume than others And we plan to keep adding different geos So what I would like, depending on, of course and all that is going to be depending on the [PERSON-1] e because there's a cost factor involving here .
EndUser: And in addition to that, [PERCENT-1] or [PERCENT-2] of the customers that contact us through voice and email, not necessarily shot, are to request the cancellation.
EndUser: So, [PERCENT-3] of the customers are really contacting us to Support to ask questions in the rest of us to ask for Support on whether they're created or working on or maybe some technical issues. Through shot.
EndUser: Is [PERCENT-4] are for cancellation the rest are for technical Support for some type of white glove Support What I'm saying on this because as we keep growing and we have so technology has advanced so muc h and when now we have a I as well I would like to be able that when a customer contact us at that point for us to immediately connec t or get Rollshard What does customers count informatio n?
EndUser: So we have screened us that customers through some different algorithms or models. So we then can say, okay, this customer is contacting us for a cancellation.
EndUser: Number one, does this customer has a high probability of being retained because we are retention, we try to do retention in all of our attempts.
EndUser: If so, can we then Support these customers through our automated services?
EndUser: Or should we then send these customers through a live agent Because understand that this customer is going t o stay with us and of course, try the [ORG-2] of our retention offers that'll be great That's the perfect customer to be sent to a top performer So we will have agents that are retention agents Maybe if we have a customer that has a local ability for being saved maybe we can .
Agent: If we
EndUser: Try to take care of this customer through maybe an automated service, whatever it is. And if not, maybe we can even create a ticket or something.
EndUser: The idea is not to push [PERCENT-5] of our customers to automated services, but how we can just be smarter in the way that we are doing things.
EndUser: So on all the different trends and things that we know of our customers, how we can better route them to either an agent or aware.
Agent: Based
EndUser: If that's for voice, same thing for chat, maybe a chat, but it can take you out of the customers.
EndUser: At the beginning and do the screening, same thing, and maybe end with the [ORG-3] e edge and depending on what the scenario is going to be.
EndUser: And for email right now we are doing [PERCENT-5] of the emails are going through tw o
Agent: Because
EndUser: Through the email channel, we are not doing retention. We are pretty much just canceling the accounts. I would like to definitely do some automation for email because there's money that we're paying for this that we could be saving.
EndUser: So in addition to that, the agents are using [ORG-1]. for chat and email and for voice they're doing the escalations through Salesforce 2. We have our own platform for to handle customers, transactions, cancellations, refunds, etc.
EndUser: And we also have five languages for voice. So the agents are managing three different platforms. So it will be ideas. Well, at some point we could have everything in just one place. This is from the sky.
EndUser: If you ask me [DATE-1] is in [DATE-2].
EndUser: Why is want for [DATE-3]?
Agent: That you
EndUser: So this will be it. Of course, I know that I said like many things in here that would require different type of projects.
Agent: But at the end, you ask me, So So, voice, for the voice you're using the 5 system and for chat, what system are you using?
EndUser: What do I envision?
EndUser: This is it. using
EndUser: Salesforce.
Agent: It's for chat, it's a salesforce and for email, it's a partial domain. Oh, it also comes with sales.
EndUser: Chat and email, we use [ORG-1] and for voice, we use 5.578569754184385.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Does the 4.410687801893620 system have any APIs or is this a home-grown system that you created?
EndUser: No, this is 5.4440098108510. It's not a custom platform.
Agent: This is, you can
EndUser: Even search for them. They're a web-based company.
Agent: Or you can say hi. It's a company.
EndUser: So
Agent: My question around this would be do you guys have like all these accounts or all these details in a single source like five has all these accounts related to them like a portal Sorry,
EndUser: They all leave in a gym forum. they all live in a [ORG-4]. This is our home. This is a platform that is owned by us, that was created by us.
EndUser: This is where we look for the customers account, see the customers account transactions, where we see the agent portal that you mentioned,
Agent: Where you
Agent: The home-grown agent portal. Okay.
Agent: So if a customer calls, the customer service representative has to go to the agent portal, check if this account is there and then bring it to the file system, and then the process goes through the voice.
Agent: So now you want to understand if that, is there any information that would say that this customer is going to retain, or is this customer going to cancel?
Agent: What are the fields or objects that would determine if this customer is going to stay, or if that customer is going to just cancel?
Agent: Do you have any options?
EndUser: You can call customers through the IVR We have the selections for the customers So can select that they want to cance l just from there So from that we already know that this is a custome r so that it's a customer that we will try to retain in other words So it's on the audience to then n with the customers and start the retention process And at the end of the conversation it's for the customer to say yes, I want to stay or not So that's it That will be pretty much the proces s.
Agent: The customers
Agent: Start the conversatio
Agent: Okay, understood. So then there is a field for the customer service agent to identify that this person is going to stay or not.
Agent: If he has a probability to stay, then he's going to talk to them and make the customer stay.
Agent: Am I right?
EndUser: Well, right now, right now, [PERCENT-5] of the customers are going to cancel, like, when I go through to an live version. And that's why we would like to deal, that's what I would like to know.
Agent: How
EndUser: Through a predictive model that we can build within the system, the customers can be screened before actually being sent to an agent.
Agent: Yeah. So, we also do not Support the algorithms for predictive models.
Agent: Like if there are any fields that would say that this customer is going to cancel or something like that, then we can directly integrate it to that system.
Agent: Like even if it comes through 5.796655869250484 or email or chat, customer wants to cancel, we can directly create those integrations between them to cancel But as far as I know, there are no predictive models that you can build within mules o f system which will predict whether the customer is going to stay or not.
Agent: That is somethin g I'm not sure that mule software will be able to do, but the other systems, like when you say, if you want a single source of truth, like if you want to move away from the agent portal and bring all those data into salesforce just to be, just for salesforce to be the single source of truth, you can either do a bulk migration of all the data to salesforce or On a [DATE-4] basis, on a regular basis, you can just push out this data from your agent portal to [ORG-1].
Agent: That is something that we can support. Also, we can also create this live automation.
Agent: If you win, you're saying that whenever email comes, it is just for cancellation and it can directly be sent to an automated system, that is something that we can support.
Agent: Except for the predictive model, everything can be done through sales mule soft.
Agent: But... We can also look into any other predictive systems and we can, we'll be able to connect to those predictive systems and if the analysis of that comes out to be, the system is going to, this customer is going to be retained, then from there we can start off the, automate the process.
EndUser: Did I have any sense?
Agent: Yes.
EndUser: Yes, excellent. In a movie, great because from, we have a team that is from the data science team, on.
Agent: That is working
EndUser: The predictive model at least the algorithm And so far the accuracy has been great So I believe the model in terms of what you're looking fo r was pretty much built by them, but we were stuck there That's done So from that to how we do it is we're gonna need some help So that part, I think that there been just tweaking for a while And I think that's right now we have something that's looking very goo d.
Agent: So that's it
Agent: Yeah, so from there, if you get the results out of the predictive model to be the custom is going to stay or not going to stay, that is somewhere that [PERSON-2] can help move the data outside to any, let's say, sales course.
EndUser: You guys to
Agent: That is where you want t he in data to be living in.
Agent: So that is the process that we can automat e. But right now I have a question saying that you guys are doing this process for, let's sa y, like [DATE-5], I think as your guys are doing this process no w. What is the urge for you to move to a predictive mod el?
Agent: Why are you considering it to be done within [ORG-5] as?
Agent: I would s ay.
EndUser: If you ask me, I will ask y ou.
Agent: Yes,
Agent: [ORG-5] So honestly, because this as.
EndUser: That's perfe ct. That's perfe ct. [DATE-3] gi ft. I would love to do that as soon as possible is a good problem to have. Actually, this is a great problem to have that we keep growing.
Agent: And growing and
EndUser: Growing and if you look at the cost it's just humongous.
Agent: For our operation
EndUser: So I think that and considering all the things that exist right now we should be able to do something.
Agent: Understood. Yeah, so I know that this manual process of having thousands of customers attending the call.
Agent: It's daily and looking into different systems is going to be a huge cost for the company also and also for the customers to be able to look into other different systems to get the data out.
Agent: So for and also you guys have Gee that to sales course connection.
Agent: Do you guys have that right now or is that something where whenever something gets escalated from sales course you want that to be as a ticket populated in [ORG-6]?
Agent: .
EndUser: Yes, and yes and yes. We have [LOC-1], but the agents don't have access to [LOC-1].
Agent: So what we
EndUser: Do is that we created some groups within [ORG-1]. When the agents need to escalate something, and this is a very, very bad process and very manual. So I hate this. The agents then create a ticket through [ORG-1].
EndUser: And then the supervisors are the one that take those tickets. They go through the tickets and they create the euros. If you they understand that there is a need for a era.
EndUser: So it's like a double thing there that we reall y need to cut. And this i s Something that I have wanted to do for a while too.
Agent: So yeah, we can also create if that ticket has this escalation kind of process or if there is urgent need to do so.
Agent: What we can do is we can create an automation or [PRODUCT-1] and Jira through which you'll be able to automatic tickets to [GPE-2]
EndUser: Have a great year
Agent: And if your supervisors want to double check it, then we can send out the tickets to supervisor where they can approve it with a button click saying that this will go create a create a task or feature or study in [GPE-3]
Agent: I missed that word .
EndUser: No, that'll be awesome because that's , course there's licenses and there's a company, it's very, .
EndUser: Am I still here?
Agent: Mm-hmm. Oh,
EndUser: I'm sorry. For some reason my screen went off. So because all these centers are third parties, are vendors.
Agent: The company
EndUser: Is, of course, we want to protect our information, and that's why they've been reluctant to provide G-RACs to all the agents.
Agent: So
EndUser: That's what I have always wanted to do, something that they're not going to have access to [LOC-1] or say, but that we can do some kind of interface that at the end this ticket will populate into [LOC-1], so we don't have to go through all this manual process.
EndUser: So I think that this will be great.
Agent: So you're saying that the agents have restricted access to [GPE-4] and they'll not be able to see those tickets until their supervisor approves it. Okay.
Agent: Then we can Um, we can, you, we can do something like this, where the tickets will be assigned to your, uh, supervisor, where if the ticket needs to be approved by the supervisor, then after approval, it goes to the, uh, or it can directly, if it does not read approval, it can directly go to the [PERSON-3] system to create a ticket in [GPE-5]
Agent: Does that sound good?
EndUser: That sounds perfect.
Agent: Yes. Yeah, so I'm also do you guys have any PDF files which the data is coming out or do I just wrote PDF files, I do not have any context there.
Agent: Like does any of the data or any of the information comes to PDF and do you want to put that into [ORG-1] also?
EndUser: Do you mean the customer's information?
Agent: If you have any, I think what she's
Agent: Trying to ask is like if you have across the entire organization any PDF files that you receive over email from the customers that you think would be beneficial from you to read those PDF files and insert data to the relevant system.
EndUser: It may be that the customers send us a balanced statement showing the charges just for reference purposes. But it's very, I'll say rare, they just take the issue.
EndUser: We're able to handle it by the words that we don't need usually Proof, right?
EndUser: Unless we can find something and then it goes beyond that escalation, you know, if we're not able to find the charges, then we ask them for that type of receipt.
EndUser: But it will be good to have the process just because of those far few, right?
Agent: But I would say this process is going to be not your first priority right now, but later in the future, going to be a priority.
EndUser: This is also
Agent: Okay, going backtracking and going to our first use case, which is the predictive model to sales course, do you know if you guys have any APIs that can be leveraged out of this predictive model?
Agent: I think that is custom homegrown, right?
Agent: The predictive model?
Agent: Yes, it is.
EndUser: It is. I don't think that they're expensive. this right now, [GPE-6], correct me if I'm wrong, but this is something that we could definitely work on, I believe.
EndUser: I wanted to have this discussion with you, of course, just to give you like all the basic information, but for this, for a next meeting, I would love to bring in our senior or, no, he's not senior director anymore, he's VP, our VP of engineering.
Agent: And now
EndUser: Some of the folks from the engineering team that are dedicated. that there will be definitely the best persons
Agent: To answer this . Yeah, that sounds good. I think that is all I had. I have a good idea and understanding of your use cases.
Agent: Are there any other systems that you'd like to integrate or how do you want your [ORG-7] solution?
Agent: What all features do you want your [ORG-7] solution to have other than just integrating?
EndUser: [PERSON-4], can you help me think here?
EndUser: All the things that we always talk about?
Agent: I'm sorry.
EndUser: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question again?
Agent: Um, like for our [ORG-7] solution, are any point [ORG-7] solution has the capability of not only integrating your two systems or four systems or five systems. It can like our name suggest any point.
Agent: It can literally connect from any system to any system, but apart from just integrating solutions, we also have an API management solution through which you can, um, add [ORG-8] policies to it, add alerting features, and if you don't want too much of [ORG-9] calls to be, if a customer, if someone is trying to attack your system, we also have Security policies to handle that, so that your system will not be attacked by a denial of service attack or something like that.
Agent: We also have [ORG-8] monitoring visualizing feature, which is built into the platform.
Agent: I was just trying to understand if these are also, important feature for you guys in the platform?
EndUser: I think when it comes to security, our IT team does have a very you know, solid process.
EndUser: However, if there are recommendations for what we're trying to accomplish, right?
EndUser: We're asking for the sky. We haven't been brought back to earth.
Agent: So
EndUser: Let's just say for that purpose. Yeah, we may want to mention something, but I can tell you like [DATE-6], we're actually celebrating some what I call it, but our IT director.
EndUser: They're sending us the phishing and the new securities and new kind of stuff that's happening around So he's very concerned and when it comes to that stuff But we're always open to the possibility of, hey, there's something new and we don't know about it So don't want to shut it down without all the proper info .
Agent: Very great
Agent: Understood understood.
Agent: So when it comes to phone calls, emails and messages, what kind of data will they be sending apart from the cancellations and renewing?
Agent: Is there any other information that they will be sending us out?
EndUser: No, no,
EndUser: I was going to say that besides that, not really, maybe. other confirmation emails, confirmation on the subscription, what was originally created because they're just getting a charge or something like this.
EndUser: But besides that, no, now that I can see right now.
Agent: So even the confirmation of subscription should or details should be entered into your sales Code system, which is attached to an account object.
EndUser: Correct.
Agent: Okay,
EndUser: Yes, and all these confirmations because remember that we have our own agent portal.
Agent: Only see if it's
EndUser: In a gym portal. So, for example, customer wants to request confirmation and on any of this, the agents have the availability to but from as important.
Agent: Send them directly So, when do you guys want to or see my dating your agent portal data into your sales system?
Agent: Is that the number one priority right now or just the Integration between all these systems is the number one priority?
EndUser: Well, that's really going to depend on something good. And for this, I have to be completely transparent with you.
EndUser: We're already almost at [DATE-7], right?
Agent: So we already
EndUser: Start working with the budget for [DATE-8]. So that's why I really wanted to have all these conversations now.
Agent: Because
EndUser: This will be something that we'll have to submit for [DATE-9]. So anything that we could talk about right now is something that will happen during [DATE-9]. Hopefully [DATE-10], but a budget process is now for us.
Agent: Yeah, so I would also like to say is that with mules of you will be able to create [ORG-10] between your agent portal and your sales force.
Agent: And in the future when you want to replace your entire like replace the agent portal with sales force, that is also a possibility even in the future because we would have already connected those connections to your agent portal for just sending data now.
Agent: But in the future, if you want to migrate and remove the agent portal, we can do a bulk upload or an [ORG-8] job to move all your data.
Agent: Into salesforce, which is also a possibility for your future so that you do not have t o buy another system to migrate all this data.
Agent: Instead, you can just use utilize a platfor m to do all the different works . Yeah,
EndUser: Perfect.
Agent: [PERSON-5], I think that is all the questions that they had. And I have a good understanding of the use case.
Agent: Do you have any questions?
Agent: I think you should. Do you have
Agent: Any questions?
Agent: I was just going to Support the [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: Do you have any questions?
EndUser: No, I think we don't have any at this point. There's a lot of things that we want to do, of course.
EndUser: So it will be more just to see maybe what you can listen to us, maybe as possible solutions, and definitely to have our engineering team for our next meeting too.
EndUser: So [PERSON-4], not too bad if- if there- something else that you can think of too .
EndUser: No, actually I'm good. I think this is a good kickoff kind of gathering and obviously we established the foundation so yeah, we're good. Sounds good.
Agent: Yeah, we definitely like the next step would be demo like [PERSON-6] collective information to be able to show you how we could help you and I feel like [PERCENT-6] of their things to struggle with could be addressed with middle soft and I like that you think about different processes right because whatever company comes to us and they think about one process then there's another process comes up right and then it's like it's better when you already know what you want and you know what a ideal future would look like.
Agent: And based on all of that, our job is to see how we can help you build this future Can that be actually done with our resources and [PERSON-6] will be able to demo that on th e next goal And I think engineering team has the most technical people on your side with the [PERSON-7] l to come because they can ask any questions Like is there anything that unclear And we will record it in case somebody on your team, on engineering team or [ORG-14] important cannot join And they want to review that was well So that could be a possibility that we can record it and share it with you and you can spread it across the tea m. as a result.
Agent: And for, I remember when we talk last time, yeah, you mentioned that in your company, there is a particular time when you budget for student purchases for [DATE-8] to be that there, if [ORG-10] ends up being a fit at the end and you said that's something you want, where until what they do you need to have, like the entire picture presented, like what's their licensing costs, particularly for you.
Agent: Case would be what is the cut on their timeline there .
EndUser: At the end, the cut off when the budget pretty much baseline is by [DATE-14].
Agent: Okay. No, we have enough time. I think we will be able to go like over everything and give you the accurate pricing and sizing by [DATE-10].
Agent: And then from there, you can decide, you know, is it something you, you want, will it get you enough value?
Agent: And as a thing that we help a lot with, um, is actually helping you with business case, right?
Agent: Um, for example, we can go over technology as much as.
Agent: We want and there is people that are hands on this program like you, [PERSON-8] you know exactly what's going on customer services like how it's affected your customers, ho w it's affected your girls.
Agent: People who are outside of this, it might seem like a problem, bu t they don't see it as a big problem, right?
Agent: Because they're not actually touching th e process and they're not the one dealing with that.
Agent: So when we do sometimes business valu e evaluation, when we ask certain questions on your current process that are more ver y far away from all the technical more on the business side where we collect an update to be able to prese nt you certain numbers that can help you justify why would you want solution in place for your current problem that sometimes our customer find benefici al and helpful as they move forward but I want to focus first on is that a fit f or you like does it serve your problems if you see it's a fit and you need our he lp always like business case creation we can we can move forward with that a nd help you feel that as we ll [NORP-8].
Agent: Sounds good.
Agent: I sure think how much time do you think do you need to be able to build a demo?
Agent: Just give me [TIME-1].
Agent: She's also flying to [GPE-7]. So she's a BDB.
Agent: Now I'm going home after [DATE-10]. So my Yeah, So yeah, thank you so much.
EndUser: God, that's great. have a safe trip.
Agent: And how does [DATE-13] sound?
Agent: [DATE-17].
Agent: 25th. Yeah, I don't know if [DATE-14] is [DATE-18] for you, [GPE-8].
Agent: [GPE-8], you break for a rough or a rough?
Agent: What is the preferred?
EndUser: Actually, both.
Agent: Both. OK. There is no OK.
EndUser: I have no issues with either because people are so creative. But.
EndUser: I like, I used
Agent: To work there, or watch the stodels, [PERSON-9] or whatever rough.
EndUser: They know this movie. That was Yeah, The red one.
Agent: Yeah. [GPE-8]. Yeah, that's what we mean.
EndUser: It
EndUser: Brings me back to the Biscuit.
EndUser: You know that when I was a kid, I didn't put a one-on-one together. Those are actual artists Like, you're an artist or the [GPE-9].
Agent: That are from [GPE-9].
EndUser: You and I thought, [GPE-8], being a kid, you know, going to series, it was amazing.
Agent: Know, so,
EndUser: I'm like, yeah, I'm a Ninja [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: Yeah. It's cool to be needed to it all. Come power.
EndUser: On. It's like you have so much Plus I love pizza. So, you know, it fits.
Agent: So you see, this is going to be your [DATE-3] gift. And then for a rough, we're going to send a big pizza with self sign in the middle.
EndUser: A mill Made with
Agent: [PERSON-10] up, you know.

Agent: I know I
EndUser: It's an ingredient. Come on. Like it's not bad.
Agent: Yeah, like I like when it's like it's a [NORP-9] style pizza, whatever they call it. I'm sure [NORP-9] don't even know that this is the pizza. That's [NORP-9], but I just like I love it. It's just taste.
Agent: Different and that's what I like about it so I know that the [NORP-2] friends would just like no talk to me after this but it's okay.
EndUser: Don't worry I love pizza
EndUser: Too but the I am on an eternal diet so I'm just eating cauliflower. No. It's good.
Agent: Also
EndUser: Yeah it's good so I still need to have pizza so I guess that I had one so I just ordered. For my family here, like they're regular normal and then another one for me just cauliflower crass.
Agent: Shall I go across the.
EndUser: And it was for me, it was like perfect. Oh, I'm having a
EndUser: Good time. Did you see a video
Agent: Of the girl who like smells chocolate by the eat salads?
Agent: Like a subject is like she eats chocolate, but she only smells chocolate, but I do very sad
EndUser: It's come on. things whenever
EndUser: I have done that.
Agent: This is really sad. Yeah, I know. So I was like, I would never, yeah, I would never do that.
EndUser: Let's look at it work.
EndUser: Go away to <inaudible> yourself.
Agent: Oh my god, funny.
Agent: That's pretty
Agent: I know you're busy, a probably middle of [DATE-18]. I don't know if this is true, [DATE-14]'s are usually pretty packed. I don't know if it's true, like would you base, like, let's start a big picture.
Agent: [DATE-19] usually [DATE-18] are the lightest for you.
EndUser: It's really bad always, but when states are usually prepack, it's rough.
EndUser: What's he saying?
EndUser: Maybe Third,
EndUser: First?
EndUser: [DATE-18], I would say [DATE-18] in our calendars. [DATE-20]'s we usually have time as well, depending on [DATE-18]. But sure for sure [DATE-18]. More than likely [DATE-18] I will say.

Agent: Of course!
EndUser: Yeah! Yeah, thank you so much.
Agent: And I just have one more question. Sorry, I didn't ask this before.
Agent: So all the data that is coming via the phone or email or chat the data science team or the predictive model team is working on that to predict the model.
Agent: And then from there, I'm going to connect those systems.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Agent: Yeah, because for the demo, I was just thinking about the demo and how to showcase you guys a custom demo. So I was thinking that all the data is going through the predictive model.
Agent: So I would like to have understanding of how I'll be able to connect to your predictive model system. So that is some information that I want. I can do that in the demo also.
Agent: No, I can ask your engineering team in the demo also. So no worries.
EndUser: Yes, I think that will just, you know, we create some cases, six samples.
Agent: Be
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: And they can see it and I'm sure that we'll be able to bring that to we move forward with this.
Agent: You. Yes,
Agent: I'm just going to showcase you demo where you'll be pulling out the information through email because that is one system which always has a cancellation record, right?
Agent: So that is something that I'll be able to show you guys in the demo. Sorry, I was just thinking in the back of my mind and I had this question. Sorry. No, no worries.
Agent: So [PERSON-6], which day you think it would be like [DATE-18] wouldn't work, right?
Agent: [DATE-20] would have worked for you.

EndUser: Yeah, I think we can do that. Okay,
Agent: Perfect. So I will send then [DATE-25] time. And if there's any questions in between, let us know include anyone on your aunt from engineering team or any other people you want to join.

Agent: But in like In [GPE-14], for example, [GPE-18] fruits sometimes feel like plastic, but I know in [GPE-14] area, you have good tasting fruits. So we are missing this in [GPE-17].
Agent: It's okay relatively compared to the rest, but I heard <inaudible> <inaudible> fruits are delicious.
EndUser: From a person that lived in [GPE-18], [GPE-18], to move back to [GPE-14], I can tell you yes they are.
Agent: Absolutely
EndUser: Different is I have avocados and guaas into my backyard not because I planted came with the and coconuts and I can tell you that I hate coconuts but I don't know why I'm eating them now.
Agent: [ORG-13]
Agent: Maybe
Agent: It's all the magic of [GPE-14]. One of my friends grew up in [GPE-14]. Now she lives in [GPE-19], but yeah, she's always telling us, like, my God, the fruits are so delicious.
Agent: The food is just overall, it has way more flavor than the [GPE-14] food.
Agent: What is this?
Agent: This is bullshit.
Agent: And then what is the other?
Agent: When I was in [GPE-18], they also have delicious fruits. And then you come back here and banana tastes like nothing. And you like, I cry inside. I'm like, my God.
Agent: I just got my I just gotta forget how good banana is supposed to taste so I don't fee l that I'm eating plastic or something.
EndUser: Yeah, we definitely have to come. Food is very good, friends are amazing. They're gan, they're fresh. You can get their local, they're here. So you're gonna love it.
Agent: And the weather is nice. I don't know if you have been to [GPE-10]. I Yeah, we have this folk [PERSON-10].
EndUser: Have.
Agent: I don't know if he knew the our folk has a name, but he does, his name is [PERSON-10]. And when he comes, there was always awful, asthymatic, because he blocks the sun. So, and he comes pretty often, unfortunately.
Agent: We went out friends. So, it was like, I hope he wouldn't come so often, but he comes. So, remind me that sometimes, you have to be cold in [DATE-30].
EndUser: I'm not. Yeah, I'm looking forward to have you here.
EndUser: Perfect,
Agent: I will get it for all recommendations. It's a once I actually make my way out there, but I'm super excited on my list.
EndUser: Enjoy

EndUser: Have a great weekend.
EndUser: Bye bye. Bye.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. The questions were about the customer's current processes, their challenges, and their goals. Specifically, the sales rep asked:
- ""What kind of data will they be sending apart from the cancellations and renewing?""
- ""Is there any other information that they will be sending us out?""
- ""What all features do you want your [ORG-7] solution to have other than just integrating?""
- ""Do you have any questions?""
- ""How much time do you think do you need to be able to build a demo?""
- ""Does that make sense?""
- ""What if we do [DATE-18], would like [TIME-3] 10am work for you?""
- ""And like [DATE-26], would that still work for you?""
These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs and expectations better, enabling them to provide a more tailored solution.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer:

The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs in terms of:

1. Predictive Model: The customer mentioned their interest in a predictive model to determine if a customer is likely to cancel. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand what specific data points the customer is using for this model, how accurate it is, and what they hope to achieve with a salesforce integration.

2. Data Management: The customer expressed a need to consolidate their data from various systems into one source of truth in Salesforce. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the current data management process, the specific data points that need to be migrated, and the timeline for this project.

3. Email Automation: The customer mentioned a desire to automate some of their email processes to reduce cancellations. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the current email process, the types of emails that are being sent, and the specific automation needs the customer has.

4. Agent Portal: The customer mentioned their current agent portal and the need to interface it with Salesforce. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the current functionality of the agent portal, the specific data points that need to be shared between the two systems, and the timeline for this project.

5. Security: The customer mentioned their IT team's focus on security. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current security measures, any specific security concerns they have, and how Salesforce can address those concerns.

6. Future Plans: The customer mentioned their rapid growth and the need to scale their operations. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's future plans, the specific areas where they anticipate growth, and how Salesforce can support that growth.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer seemed to be interested in the seller's product and its capabilities. They mentioned several use cases and potential integrations with their existing systems. However, they also expressed some concerns about the cost and manual processes involved. They were looking for ways to automate and streamline their operations, and the seller's product seemed to be a potential solution for that. Overall, the customer seemed to be open to further discussions and exploring the possibilities of implementing the seller's product in their operations.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So, voice, for the voice you're using the 5 system and for chat, what system are you using?"" The customer seemed more engaged as they provided clear and detailed information about their current systems for voice and chat.

2. ""Do you guys have any PDF files which the data is coming out or do I just write PDF files, I do not have any context there."" This question piqued the customer's interest, and they discussed the rarity of receiving PDF files from customers and how they handle such situations.

3. ""And for email right now we are doing [PERCENT-5] of the emails are going through tw o Through the email channel, we are not doing retention. We are pretty much just canceling the accounts. I would like to definitely do some automation for email because there's money that we're paying for this that we could be saving."" The customer showed enthusiasm for the idea of automation in email management, highlighting the potential cost savings."

Agent: The anti-platform for you. I've been in social security system for [DATE-1], then I've seen [DATE-2]-ish projects. So I'm normally in causing this to lend perspective how far you should keep your project safe.
EndUser: In the real job of What I really want
Agent: To do in this call is go through your processes hey, here's how we're doing marketing [DATE-3].
EndUser: And really understand,
Agent: Here's how we're doing things in your sales process.
EndUser: I know I have a technical
Agent: Conversation pending regarding an [ORG-1] and Epicure integration. I'll save a lot of that for your technical team. I kind of want to segment it out for [TIME-1] for the front part, [TIME-2] for the next part.
Agent: And then maybe there are some questions in between about some and all how many people.
EndUser: Quantitative things
Agent: And is it me, I'm in a sales resource office [DATE-3] in [GPE-1]. Um, I'm here in background.
Agent: Is it coming for me?
Agent: I'm not sure Okay.
EndUser: A little bit, but it's manageable.
Agent: Cool. If it becomes unimaginable, just let me know. I'll go on and off mute.
Agent: Uh, but tell me, you know, I, I know the systems that you use, but where does your marketing process start?
Agent: Are you starting with, um, ads or you with some outbound things that you're doing digitally, but tell me a little bit more about like your digital, um, you know, marketing approaches right now.
EndUser: [ORG-2] starting, you know, directly
Agent: We are
EndUser: Currently doing a lot of [ORG-2] ads. Well, I wouldn't say a lot. That's where our primary focus is on ads. We do want to do LinkedIn ads in the future.
EndUser: That's kind of our primary ad focus, I guess, right now. Gotcha.
Agent: And when you get these various trackers that are coming back, I mean, are you turning that into some sort of campaign attribution?
Agent: Tell me how you convert that to some sort of other element of digital marketing follow-up.
EndUser: We aren't.
Agent: So that's something Okay.
EndUser: We'd be able to do.
Agent: I
EndUser: Just really know it's kind of bad talk right now. Yeah,
EndUser: I'll kind of, I think there might be some shortcuts to what you're asking for [PERSON-1] and I'll just say a lot of our processes, especially on the sales pipeline side are really underdeveloped.
EndUser: So we'd be looking for a tool like [ORG-3] to come in and kind of. And not tell us all the answers, but help us define them and do best practices with them.
EndUser: Yeah, that's a good way of saying it. Okay.
Agent: Um, so we'll stuff about your ideal process, right?
Agent: So you have Something that happened in a [ORG-2] app, right?
Agent: It's on someone's dashboard.
Agent: Who's actually that?
EndUser: I feel
EndUser: Like that would be somebody within the marketing team. I Don't know this is kind of also where I think we're looking for help getting started and like bettering understand how to create that process.
EndUser: Right. Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's hard for me to say because we don't do anything right
EndUser: Now. Well, I'd like to get that done. So,
Agent: No worries. So, let's say you found someone who's interested in when your services.
Agent: Do you add them to any campaign [DATE-3]?
Agent: Um,
EndUser: No,
EndUser: We can. We have done things like that in the past, but it's been manually tranact.
Agent: Okay. All right.
Agent: And then, um, who'd be responsible for like just any of the level follow up on the marketing side?
EndUser: Um, that would probably be myself, [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3], the marketing team.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: All right, and then how do you distribute those leads?
EndUser: So the leads right now, if we get a form submitted on our website, they're automatically sent to that person within that region or product category. So it's manually distributed that way. We don't physically not manually.
EndUser: Or
EndUser: It's automatically distributed that way. We don't manually distribute leads right now.
EndUser: Gotcha. Okay.
Agent: So
EndUser: We're not creating a opportunity record for those.
EndUser: Say that again, We're just sending them via email, right?
EndUser: [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Yeah. Gotcha. And what's
Agent: The volume of leaves we're talking about here?
EndUser: I don't know.
EndUser: [PERSON-4], do you know the answer to that question?
EndUser: I don't know that it was stuff.
EndUser: A good amount of
EndUser: Do you feel
Agent: Like you're buried?
Agent: Do you feel like you can go get a glass of wine at $[MONEY-1]?
EndUser: I think that's how the sales team would feel. I don't know.
EndUser: I mean, if I were to look and see how many leads came in on our website [DATE-3], what's it, a fifth?
EndUser: We've gone about eight leads [DATE-3]. So and they've probably all been sent to different people. So I think it's definitely manageable.
EndUser: I would say there's definitely a bunch of Yeah.
EndUser: Slack there.
EndUser: We start automating them.
Agent: So if I said, is it eight times [DATE-4] is that eight times [DATE-5]?
Agent: Like, what do you think?
Agent: Is that pretty typical?
EndUser: It's an old exhibition. Like [DATE-6] we got one, two, three, four, [DATE-7], six. Yes, here we had 12. So yes, here was a little bit higher. I would say we probably averaged between. five two 15 a day.
Agent: Because we didn't
EndUser: Get in the middle. That's great. Yeah. Well, I mean, like we don't get leads on [DATE-8], typically, like we didn't get anything on [DATE-9]. I would say we'd probably average about eight two 10. Yeah. Okay.
Agent: So is that like a hundred?
Agent: So you don't get on [DATE-10]. So that's about 123 leads or so that you're
EndUser: Getting on a [DATE-10]. Yeah, that that's
EndUser: Just just the or try start
EndUser: Business, not including [NORP-1] or side. That's a good point. Yeah, that's just like a C try start. That's also not any leads that come in through the phone. Okay, that's just website.
Agent: Oops, I don't. Okay.
Agent: And what about other lead sources?
EndUser: Um, should you give me an example of
Agent: What one of those would be?
Agent: Well, you said the website is one, and then you said the phone was another.
Agent: How many of these you get via the phone, but people that just call you?
EndUser: Okay, that's probably a lot more. Well, [PERSON-5]'s done, though, but I also- But those are typically- Right, let's say you can say, it depends. Some people call us and they're like ready to buy.
EndUser: And some people are calling us for budgetary. Lots of these things.
EndUser: So those may never be.
EndUser: Right, action I'm trying to say.
Agent: Door tracked. I guess is what
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Got it. How can I put number on it?
EndUser: Got you. She and I entering those leads directly now. OK. Fair enough. All right. And then that's another thing too. Like, if we get a lead directly into [ORG-4], unless
EndUser: On our website, it's not entered from my understanding [PERSON-4], like, unless a quote is
Agent: Generated. And then even then it's somebody has to mean the old site. Yeah.
EndUser: I hope so. Okay. All right.
EndUser: So how about lightning pages?
EndUser: Do you have anything there?
EndUser: Going on
EndUser: We have a couple of landing pages into to your notes.
EndUser: Right now that are embedded mapped out which is who we
EndUser: Our word press, use for our website. And then. We don't know if it's, we have. I have.
EndUser: I'm sorry, I'm getting a little distracted because [PERSON-4] and I are sitting in the same room and I can hear the doctor coming. Okay, we'll just keep moving. Okay, then we good.
EndUser: So right now we have a couple of any pages that are embedded within our word press. They're more mostly like branded. branded landing page, so like if we acquire a company, we have a landing page.
EndUser: We have a trade show landing
Agent: Page that's actually on [PRODUCT-1] right now through an acquisition. So that'd be something we'd want to duplicate. Okay. Fantastic. All right. Very straightforward to have elements move directly into the system. All right. Let's talk about the sales process.
EndUser: So you have a lead.
EndUser: Are you tracking your conversion rates or anything like that?
EndUser: How many get converted?
EndUser: Not effectively. So we typically start our tracking when a formal quote has been completed. So our data only really becomes converted.
EndUser: So when we look at it, it looks like our close radar conversion rate is like [PERCENT-1] when... Got it. Obviously not the truth.
Agent: If you could show everyone that secret sauce, you have a whole not the bad guy that came in correct.
EndUser: The business line right there. That would be fantastic. Unfortunately, I'd be and said that number is not
Agent: Oh well. All good.
Agent: How many points are you doing?
Agent: A lot.
EndUser: So I think quotes are about 100 to 123 a day. Um, actually I can pull up a metric and tell you pretty accurately that's probably
Agent: An old number. That's interesting. So you have 136 leads a month, but you have 99 quotes Yes.
EndUser: Per day. Exactly.
Agent: So a lot of the repeat the existing
EndUser: Business. Yes. So the volume is really coming from, and we'll quote things to multiple customers.
EndUser: So we'll have a project-based business that may go out to bid, and we'll load it to like three or four distributors, who are just trying to win it from the contractors.
EndUser: So there's two locations kind of rampant across our quotes too.
Agent: And he maybe do a screen share and like take me a little bit through the planning process like how does that work?
Agent: Are you using spreadsheets?
Agent: Do you have a Um, it's
EndUser: System for that?
EndUser: So we use [ORG-5]. all in [ORG-5]. Okay. Yeah. And I don't think I can share my screen with it because I don't know. I don't think we have an [ORG-6].
Agent: Uh, do we have ones who have a pass through jets and if not, we could definitely talk through
EndUser: The process. But I don't think we did. We do. I don't think we have an idea in place.
Agent: I'll go on those.
EndUser: I can kind of Yeah.
Agent: Explain the process.
EndUser: [ORG-5] is currently is pretending to be our [ORG-7]. I guess this is the best way I would put it. But it is a ERP and it's our central project Manufacturing ERP database.
EndUser: So I was in [PERCENT-2] of our corporate data is in our [ORG-5] instance. including parts, products, pricing, customer information. So we'll take all of that.
EndUser: They actually take it offline into a spreadsheet to calculate what price a customer is supposed to get on what product combination.
EndUser: They'll go through, they'll create that pull net before, save it, send it to the salesperson who sends it to the customer, or if it's going through one of our Manufacturing
Agent: Wraps, they'll send it to the customer. The territory or internal person and the manufacturer at the same time.
EndUser: So is the [ORG-8] or the territory rep making it at the exact same time?
EndUser: Do they get equal attribution on the. No, the deal or okay. So our internal on what we call a SIP program. So they have a yearly number, a [DATE-12] quota.
EndUser: So everything kind of goes into that and they're paid on what percent they've achieved to that. Our Manufacturing reps, they get paid on the dollar so they get off a flat percentage.
EndUser: And then we do split that three ways as well. So we pay where it ships, where the bill 2
Agent: Is, and if a different rep brought it in, it didn't vote either of those. We give them a percent. Gotcha.
EndUser: And just help me understand the quoting process itself. Are you picking items that are pre-selected in like a skew format and [ORG-9] or no. So we don't scale. So we typically manufacture orders. So we have a hierarchy called custom configured.
EndUser: I don't remember what the full acronym is. But a lot of the stuff is in like the engineer to order.
EndUser: We're not really pulling stuff out of stock unless it's for like a very large cut-throughs or ordering the same thing over and over again. But even then it's not skewed. Just a.
EndUser: So that's kind of where that spreadsheet comes in. If it is customer, if it is something that's engineered, that's typically priced the product team.
Agent: Through the engineering through
EndUser: Gotcha. And
Agent: They send it back on the spreadsheet with all the details?
Agent: Yep. Gotcha. Pretty common in your industry,
EndUser: By the way, for Manufacturing industry consultant. I know why you like or dislike the stimulus record.
Agent: It's not great for me, but I get why we get sent back. So they do whatever [PERSON-6] could take to create a quote using their secret sauce and formulas.
Agent: And then do you get back a bunch of line items
EndUser: Of what's in the quote or is it just like here's a total number and a bill of materials.
Agent: We do itemize.
Agent: I'll get an M and D in place really quickly because I'm trying to visualize something possible to visualize, but I see where you're going with everything. But it will save some time in the call.
Agent: I'll spend the rest of the extra time with an M and [NORP-2] Okay. So you got back your line item quote. And what you do with that
EndUser: Is anyone reviewing it approving it, how did that work?
EndUser: In theory, yes, in practice, not as much as we've. So pricing is defined by whatever tier that customer has been assigned to. So their discount or their multiplier, whatever you want to call it.
EndUser: So that gets applied, it gets sent. There are guidelines on who is specific for entire discounts.
EndUser: But what we see pretty frequently in [GPE-2] is somebody just changes the customer's account status to a different level and that's how they discount it. Bye.
EndUser: Again, something we have no way to track when that's happening So that's kind of how this accounting works As far as reviewing it, we have standard terms.
EndUser: They go on all the quotes We have had a few instances where somebody sends back a PO . with terms that don't match. They've been caught, caught
Agent: But they normally get when we're trying to collect and the customers are admitted in terms.
EndUser: I get to the terms because I have a lot of questions about that.
Agent: Want to jump back before we
EndUser: Do you ever do any type of contracted pricing where, hey, you know, okay. Yeah, so our biggest customers have fixed pricing and they'll have, we'll define it at the part number
Agent: Which is, I mean, it's a considerable amount of our volume goes through that.
EndUser: Got you. So they have their own custom set of prices.
EndUser: How many different customers have fixed pricing or product prices?
EndUser: I think it's four. And they're all on our portable power side. So our kind of our book and build stuff. Nobody on the critical facilities or the systems side,
Agent: The more complex custom solutions have anything like that.
Agent: That's a customer short. Okay.
Agent: What happens when do you have customers shared between the different divisions?
Agent: So they have like critical systems. So they
EndUser: Get custom quoting and then they may have some fixed bid pricing or, um, custom pricing done, does that ever happen?
EndUser: Yes, so you're starting to get into the top questions. So yes, we do have some overlaps.
EndUser: So specifically, I guess, generator dealers, they typically have a rental division where they'll rent out our equipment, but they also will install permanent installations oftentimes where they would be looking at one of our custom or configured custom solutions.
EndUser: In those cases, I mean, I don't know if there's any overlap with the ones with the contracted pricing, but they are internally at [ORG-10], we treat them as like two separate cost-stars.
Agent: Does that create any challenges for you?
EndUser: Yes. So specifically tracking them.
EndUser: I mean, they look when I pull data and I get my data dump, it looks like they're all sold to the same customer where in reality, I need to go split them to the different sales teams.
EndUser: I need to go credit the sales to the different sales teams or report a revenue to the different divisions of the company.
Agent: About it.
EndUser: We do have, I mean, we have talked about a way to fix this and I don't think it's a [PRODUCT-2] fix. It's probably never worth it.
EndUser: But utilizing parent child accounts, just calling the child to the different divisions that we have internally.
Agent: Yep, you could do that in [ORG-3] as well. Parent child opportunities. There's a few methods. You just got to make sure the thing syncs the way you want it to. But anyway, we'll get there.
Agent: That kind of leads to my question on terms, right?
Agent: When you have these different divisions with these different quoting methods, do you have common terms for each client?
EndUser: Yes, the only difference is going to be whole expiration timing.
Agent: Gotcha.
Agent: All right, and then anything else I should know about terms because you started topic.
EndUser: I don't think so. I mean, we're not very mature and I mean, adhering to terms. Somebody's on the field with different terms. Fair enough. All right. So when you now have
Agent: Those terms if it's a new customer is there like a general council review do you have any Workflow around that?
EndUser: Yeah, this is not general council, but typically it just goes to our controller in her team.
EndUser: To validate the customer's credit first off and second off make sure that whatever we issued is good with them So it's I mean of the time it's good Everyone so well we sell something to somebody who's brand new to the company for North of six figures and somebody wants to really make sure that customer can pay, I guess.
EndUser: Which it has held up deals that we've gotten [ORG-10]
Agent: For the past. I think sort of credit approval.
Agent: Ok, so now you have something. Let's do the loss case first. So let's say we don't win. You know, this particular opportunity pursuit. Are you tracking that anywhere?
EndUser: Do they go into any remarketing campaigns?
EndUser: So, kind of, we do track losses, and we do have a field for putting a reason on losses, but what we usually see is, what we automatically lost due to expiration.
EndUser: So, if you pull the data, it's [PERCENT-3] expired as the reason it lost, but the other [PERCENT-4] happening,
Agent: Whatever, it's not somebody put in there. Interesting. So if it just expired, that means they're not interested. And you're or are
EndUser: You chasing them when it's near the expiration term?
EndUser: Do you have any system to do that?
EndUser: We don't. We do sometimes chase them.
EndUser: So we have a category of quoted deals called hold for approvals, where we have essentially verbal confirmation we want to bid, but they aren't ready to issue a [ORG-12] yet for whatever reason.
EndUser: So we'll put those in this [ORG-12] holds for a full category Words it's still just an open quote, but we have essentially a higher tier where like This is like [PERCENT-2] chance we're going to get this one, but we just don't know the timing on it.
EndUser: So we are following up on those ones, but we're not following them. That's you.
Agent: And then when you you do is there an initiation process?
EndUser: Win, should
Agent: When you are in a closed
EndUser: One state where you actually win the bill?
EndUser: So our CX team internally will intake the PO, they'll convert the quote to an order. You fill in essentially the [ORG-12], finalize customers details, so ship to is the most important one at that stage.
EndUser: And then they'll essentially close the order. It goes to our project or operations team who finalize the estimated ship date.
EndUser: So go through the lead time, figure out if there's any remaining items left on the project that we need to know we have to get done, how long those are going to take.
EndUser: Then that process usually only takes like a half a day, and then we'll send out a sales order
Agent: Acknowledgement. Ok. Thank you. Ok. Fair.
Agent: What else should you be doing in a true traditional [PRODUCT-2]
EndUser: Before we started building stuff?
EndUser: So the big gap we have now is pre-quote pipeline. So between [PERSON-7] and myself, what's happening there is really a big gap. And it's kind of a big gap. We don't really have a way to connect
Agent: A lead into revenue. Gotcha.
EndUser: Any other symptoms that we should be looking for?
EndUser: I mean, so, [PRODUCT-3] are [PRODUCT-2] as of right now, and it's kind of poorly labeled as a [PRODUCT-2].
EndUser: So, all of the general like customer relationship management functions are, subpar, I guess, is the best way I would put it. So hierarchy of customers, labeling contacts is all flat. Okay. Which is something we
Agent: Know we need to change. We know we need a lot more flexibility in adding attributes to customers as well. Okay.
Agent: Any other things that we
EndUser: Should be automating to make it like these here?
EndUser: And again, we'll do the [ORG-4] integration piece a little bit later, but what else is top of smart?
EndUser: I know there's a lot of talk about automating stuff, specifically in like tracking conversions, win or eights, all of that stuff. The Lead Scoring too we've talked about doing. So trying to get a good idea on.
EndUser: So one of the pushbacks has been the volume might be too much to have everybody type in while they're pipeline data for every opportunity.
Agent: We've had on [PRODUCT-2]
EndUser: I think that's apples and oranges, I guess, would be my opinion. But I get where they're coming from. But in my places, I think we can probably automate a large portion of that data entry.
EndUser: Like, put push an opportunity into somebody's queue, or they're called queue straight from
Agent: The website. Like, this shouldn't have to be somebody making a decision on that. The sitting can be made when we call them or send me an email. Gotcha. Couple closing questions for me just like tile this together.
Agent: So we know that the lead to code [ORG-14] isn't properly tracked a couple falls attribution points there, but you seem to have really
EndUser: Good metrics on your code to over so of the quotes per day.
EndUser: How many of those turn into one screen?
EndUser: So that's where that [PERCENT-5] memory comes in. So it's [PERCENT-6]. Gotcha. And we have to create an order to create an order so there's no skipping that stuff. Gotcha.
Agent: I guess one quick pop up on that from my perspective [PERSON-4] because I think one thing we're working on is trying to put together like the business case for you guys as you're discussing this internally and just want to make sure like we're kind of catering this case to your specific business needs and things like that.
Agent: So when you say like 100 to 104 quotes [DATE-3], is that like how many projects would you say that?
Agent: Because I know you mentioned sometimes you may have three or four quotes for one project or pursuit that you're running after. So you have any idea
EndUser: Like how many projects are there or did I hear you correctly there?
EndUser: You did. So it's less. So the project business is lower volume. And I could probably get some better metrics here, but the majority of the volume is on our portable side, which is kind of our book and bill.
EndUser: So those aren't projects.
Agent: Aren't going to bid. Those
EndUser: That's somebody calling in and saying they need a pool of cable shipped to wherever, and they need it [DATE-12]. So, I mean, I'm pretty realistic.
EndUser: I don't think we're ever going to be able to capture those as opportunities. We've talked about putting like, because those are typically our larger putting like a target on each of those customers and right, the ducting.
Agent: Customers, you know,
EndUser: Yeah. So that's kind of where the majority of the volume is. And I would say that [PERCENT-1] number really indicates that the duplication are, I
Agent: Mean, at least less than 10%. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And would you say like out of those 96 to 142, like what percentage of those would you say are like portable power quotes versus some of the
EndUser: Larger, more strategic projects type opportunities?
EndUser: I'm not sure off the top
Agent: Of my head. I know a majority of them are going to be the powerful power. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's helpful to understand.
Agent: I guess one other follow up on that and I'm sure this like varies pretty widely depending on which line of business and stuff. But do you have any idea on just like the average
EndUser: Quote size for you guys typically across the board?
EndUser: Across the board I think it's like 62k
Agent: But it's
EndUser: Wildly skewed. So we'll have some like [MONEY-2]. partners will also have some, you know, like, might be stuff,
Agent: I wouldn't, there so 1214, but like less than 10,000. So yeah, that's pretty pretty big range there. Yeah, but okay. Okay,
Agent: Well, that's helpful. Sorry, [PERSON-1], didn't want to like mess up your flow there by No, no, you're going exactly where I was going to go. Really, I think that's my last question regarding process related things.
Agent: Um, I think I'd have to definitely get an [ORG-15] in place because we have to talk about data flow, because I think what's going to happen is, um, a lot of the conversation is going to be determined by how data is sloped to an [ORG-14] and [ORG-3].
Agent: Yeah. But I totally got the top funnel piece, uh, the sales and general quoting flow. Now I need fields and screens and that sells like [ORG-15], which I should work on now.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, so I was gonna yeah, maybe follow up on that piece with you, [PERSON-4], because like I think that's still the last piece that we're trying to understand from our side is like.
Agent: How you guys exactly want to execute on the application. I know you mentioned you guys have resources internally that have done that before.
Agent: But wasn't sure if you've had any more like conversations around how you guys are thinking about that piece, but.
Agent: Once again, we just want to make sure like we're including all that information and we show you guys our Implementation plan and pricing and stuff like that.
Agent: So wanted to follow up there to kind of get your guidance on like how we should
EndUser: Kind of dig a little bit deeper on that integration piece with you guys. Yeah, so it's not nailed down internal.
EndUser: So there's people in the boat, myself included, who think we can do a lighter integration and maybe sink over the transactional data, like a read-only capacity. Sure.
EndUser: There's other people that think we probably need to be able to work with that in both systems.
Agent: I sure.
Agent: And some of that was just determined where the different things are in your workflow, for example, doing the order to sync back and I know this one of the things that was discussed at one point in time.
Agent: So it's a matter of just the particular fields, but the sync schedule is where you do the sync, we do the sync. It doesn't matter.
Agent: It's really a question of how do we just identify be sent and to get as simple as possible.
EndUser: The data to
EndUser: Yeah, and quite honestly, I think we are ready. less than perfect state in what's in [PERSON-8]. I mean, we have art. I'll just give you one example.
EndUser: So if you're looking for the estimated ship date of an order, there's five potential date fields that could be coming from depending on what stage it is
Agent: In the project. Yeah. Yeah, it's one of those things where your control point becomes particularly important.
Agent: Because it could be during one stage you are sinking a date from one part and You're also a net stage sinking a date from other parts in same field also seen all those fields Replicated as timestamps or date stamps in multiple fields depending on stage.
Agent: So Yeah, I think again same screen talk through the date interaction.
EndUser: We should talk about their Workflow
Agent: It's
EndUser: Not hard is just methodical. Yeah
Agent: Yeah, I guess, you know, just from our perspective, [PERSON-4], because I'm just trying to, you know, see what makes the most sense in terms of like how we want to approach like Implementation and stuff.
Agent: Would it be possible to like get on the phone with some people from like your IT team to kind of hammer some of the like those details out in terms of.
Agent: What do you want that integration to look like?
Agent: You know, what that's gonna look like?
Agent: Like, is that a possibility?
EndUser: I'm curious to get your thoughts on that. Yeah, it's possible. It's hard to spend time with them.
Agent: Short staff right now.
EndUser: I can try. It might be easier if you're comfortable having like an email conversation with them. You're asking those kind of questions via email and just giving them a list to get back to you.
Agent: Okay. In terms of integrations, honestly, conversation.
EndUser: It should be an interactive
Agent: If not, I mean.
Agent: We could say, well, what are the fields into one map?
Agent: What is the directionality fields?
Agent: It tends to be bigger. We can do it on email. And I think it's just way more efficient. And we get to wrap the line and small it down.
Agent: We could normally a tech call like that is like [TIME-3]. Again, it's just a question of what is it that you want synced as question number one.
Agent: Then question number two is, where's that data placed?
Agent: And then question number three is just the method. And that's the entire format of everything.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I can definitely
Agent: Try to get somebody on the phone. Yeah, and people normally have some pretty strong opinions regarding data. The data security piece will help. Yeah, it's going Yeah.
EndUser: To be. Yeah. So, it's like you've times.
Agent: Been to this rodeo a few It's not the first time with me.
EndUser: I've had this. You're like laughing
Agent: This is great. I know what's next. Yeah. I appreciate you. I do. Yeah. I'll get an [ORG-18] in place real quick.
Agent: Okay, because yeah, I think like that's outside of, you know, I know we have some calls scheduled with you and [PERSON-9] to kind of go over like, you know, final final review of like why [ORG-3] for [PERSON-10] and then going over pricing total cost of ownership and like.
Agent: Yeah, until like, I guess until we have that conversation that's still going to be like an outstanding piece from us and.
Agent: Just want to make sure like you and [PERSON-10] have all the information you need to take this to your executive team and kind of Share like what an investment could look like because like The last thing we would want is you go to your executive team and say hey salesforce is gonna cost this much to implement And then later down the road we find out we didn't really scope out that epic or piece and then come back and say Oh, it's gonna be this much more, you know,
EndUser: That's what we're trying to avoid here And I guess that's like why I'm just trying to be transparent and like make sure that's you know On on everyone's radar and we can get that [ORG-21] signed out Yeah, I know my business system manager has given me that exact feedback.
EndUser: We should be as detailed as possible before giving they've
Agent: Myself because
Agent: Had some poor experiences in the past with stuff they've tried to scope out an epiphar and it's been a lot more work than expected. Yeah.
Agent: Well, that's part of the conversation too, right?
Agent: Do we tackle the integration for you a little more cost?
Agent: Do you do the integration using some of your tools?
Agent: Well, let's call some before effort. Which tools we use, it was a standard tool.
EndUser: Lots of ways to it's the same work that's going to be done by someone, it could be unique, but you, we just have to keep it as efficient as possible.
Agent: Crack the dot. It's, again,
EndUser: Someone has to QA it no matter what, right?
EndUser: So. Yeah, and I honestly, I'm not sure if we know internally how we want to distribute the resources or what. What level of help we want with this. We do have a development team.
EndUser: They have done sales force, that record integrations before.
Agent: It's just do bad time to do something like this in the timeframe. I
Agent: Understand. I can help you get to. smaller and stateless may be more efficient than a lot of integrations.
Agent: My biggest joke is I'll tell you the five tables and a half to do, right, because it's not working the other way. Seven, you want your line items, 14 when you get ambitious.
Agent: I start here and there was like 27, I'm like, whoa, whoa.
Agent: Why are you sick from that table?
Agent: Let's not do that.
Agent: So, we'll get that.
Agent: Okay. Cool. Well, I think, [PERSON-12], does that answer most of your questions based on kind of like
Agent: The process stuff [DATE-3] or anything else you were hoping to uncover there. So, we'll get a pretty greedy data and houses
EndUser: M and D
Agent: A mutual non-scholish agreement. That's my next step. Okay.
Agent: [PERSON-4], who would be the best two on the show?
EndUser: Person to send that in the A over
Agent: I'll out who needs to sign up.
Agent: Figure
Agent: Okay, we'll do. Okay.
Agent: And then from there, you know, as far as like trying to get some time, maybe with [PERSON-12] again, what do you think the best approach is there, [PERSON-4]?
Agent: Like, is it, you know, like we're happy to send over the questions over email, but I think to [PERSON-1]'s point, it would probably would be a lot more efficient to hop on a call. Do you think he'd
EndUser: Be open to like a [TIME-4] chat?
EndUser: I think so. His calendar is pretty bucked up. So maybe I'll try to find some times [DATE-12], maybe.
Agent: See if I can get there during this open. Okay. Because yeah, I know we have that call on [DATE-14] on [DATE-15], where we're hoping to kind of go through like that total cost of ownership.
Agent: So if it's possible to have that [DATE-14], I know like [PERSON-12], it sounds like he's pretty dizzy, but it could be possible to kind of iron that out [DATE-14] and we can come back next out [LOC-1] for you
EndUser: [DATE-14] and have that fully fleshed guys. So just pulled up his calendar. So let's see. Okay, Looks like [DATE-18] [TIME-5].
Agent: We do have time.
Agent: To 353 central tone. Let's see. Oh,
Agent: Man. Well, it looks like you're. Pretty busy. Could you guys do potentially like anytime
EndUser: After 4th or is that too late?
Agent: To 5 is open. I think we can do that. OK, [PERSON-1], would that like.
Agent: Work on your end?
Agent: It looks
Agent: Well, it's mega work. OK. Awesome. Well, I'll send over an invite to then [PERSON-4] and then.
Agent: You know, I could maybe just give a little bit of context on [PERSON-12] and then if you could just kind of let him know internally what we're going to be going over, I think that'd be helpful.
Agent: And then, like I said, that should give us the information we need to come back to you guys on [DATE-21] and give you that fully fleshed out number.
Agent: [PERSON-1] can walk through the Implementation plan and just make sure you guys have all the information there. So, for sure. Awesome. Well, appreciate you guys hopping on here and walking through some of those pieces [DATE-3]. Thank you.
Agent: Anything any questions you had for us like that have popped up since we last spoke that we haven't gotten to or like Anything else worth calling out I don't think so that comes to mind Okay Okay, awesome.
EndUser: There?
Agent: Well, I will i'll go ahead and get that invites into out [DATE-14] for [DATE-18] and then Yeah, I think we have a quick seat [DATE-15] with you and [PERSON-9], so we'll chat more then and then Yeah, look forward
EndUser: To catching up again later in [DATE-23]. So
Agent: Thank care.
EndUser: You guys Take
Agent: Thanks for the time guys.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""How does your marketing process start?""

The seller also mentioned sending over a mutual non-disclosure agreement.

Question: Were there any mentions of competitors during the call? If so, who and what were the key points of differentiation?

Answer: There were no direct mentions of competitors during the call.

Question: Were there any blockers or concerns mentioned by the customer that could prevent the deal from closing? If so, what were they and how can they be addressed?

Answer: The customer expressed concerns about the integration process and the resources required for it. They mentioned having an internal development team that has experience with Salesforce integrations. The seller acknowledged these concerns and suggested keeping the integration as efficient as possible.

48. ""So you have a lead. Are you tracking your conversion rates or anything like that? How many get"
video_14195_167_6qr3y000000od6EAAQ,"Agent: Okay, here we go.
Speaker 6: All
Speaker 6: Right. I'll go that one. Okay. Sorry.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: Can you see that?
Speaker 6: Yep. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So essentially every day we get sent this production sheet from site. So they are manually Recording hours, a little bit of information on the crushing gear and what they're producing.
Speaker 6: So this is [TIME-1] for each machine. And then you've got the product and it's split into different types. So they're manually handwriting all of this, sending it in.
Speaker 6: From there, we then enter all of that information into a spreadsheet for site and for our records so we can see a full caption of [DATE-1]. So we'll have, so it's broken in [DATE-2].
Speaker 6: We sort of capture how [TIME-2] the guys are working in and then the product that they're producing given us a total.
Speaker 6: If we're chart and depended on how we're charging, we sort of change that up a little bit. So this site in particular we charge per ton. Other sites we might charge per hour on each machine.
Speaker 6: That's the production side. That goes to the customers. It helps us know how to invoice. It shows the customer what we're going to invoice them and sort of gives them a screenshot.
Speaker 6: So that's quite sort of labor intensive that part. Then from there, as far as maintenance goes, and sorry, I was in the middle of opening something, when I interrupted this will do service.
Speaker 6: Okay, this is what I want. Okay, so we have every all of our fitters, they'll have a just a hand like a book.
Speaker 6: You know, carbon copy book, that will fill out a service report and scan it and send it into here. I save it and then this here is our file maker system.
Speaker 6: So from these you have the maintenance record, enter that information
Agent: In and you basically drag across to put in that
Speaker 6: Probe the actual service report.
Speaker 6: Are you scheduling in these maintenance at the moment?
Speaker 6: Again, so it's all we have to recognize that it needs to be done. We put it in here. We'll leave it, enter it all into here.
Speaker 6: And basically, if this date closed is not filled out, we can then run a report and it shows us everything that's open. The report from there is quite as it gets extracted as an [PRODUCT-1]. I'll show you, sorry.
Speaker 6: It opens up like this, that you then save it as an [PRODUCT-1] spreadsheet, and you sort of have to change all your filters, you know, change it so that it's all by site, by machine, et cetera.
Speaker 6: And then when it's finished, you close, you enter in a date into that other field to close it off. So it's very fiddly, takes a lot of manipulation
Agent: To get to do what we want. So we want something that's very easy. Basically with your maintenance is a do you have set schedules
EndUser: For the different types of machines For maintenance We we do so each machine has a has an interval of [TIME-3] So [TIME-4] we need to service them that The main issue that we've got with our crushing equipment is that it's really, really high maintenance.
EndUser: So it may not be a particular service that needs to be done. There may need to be a wear tie, but needs to be changed. A particular wear part that needs to be changed out. A belt might break.
EndUser: So every week we actually do [DATE-3]. So we allocate [TIME-5] [DATE-4] to just go around machinery, make sure that things are getting changed out in a timely manner. Thanks for watching !
EndUser: And then every month we allocate [DATE-5] as planned maintenance days to stay on top of our maintenance. [TIME-6] schedule where it gets captured
Agent: And the from is our [DATE-6] production sheets, which [PERSON-1] was showing you. But we don't have to have a program in the system. Yeah, sure. Okay.
Agent: So let me just reiterate that just to make sure that I understand properly. So you've got.
Agent: A [DATE-7], kind of like a mini maintenance that you kind of make sure that you're doing the preventative stuff before your major [DATE-8], which you separate that out for [DATE-9] to actually do your major servicing.
Agent: [TIME-7] and all that that contribute to the [TIME-8] service
EndUser: Is based off the [DATE-6] reports that you get from your guys out in the field to then count towards that service.
EndUser: Is that correct?
EndUser: Correct, yeah, we try and
Agent: Build, we try and build our [TIME-9] servicing when we can into our [DATE-10].
Agent: Right, so it doesn't necessarily mean, so the [DATE-10], what are they then?
Agent: So it's a it's not part of that [TIME-9]
EndUser: Servers or you would try and just do it then in its not [TIME-3].
EndUser: What would you do then in [DATE-10]?
EndUser: We would still have a whole bunch of stuff to do. So
Speaker 6: Can you just zoom in on the screen?
Agent: What we've got there on
Speaker 6: Because I can't really see it.
EndUser: So
Speaker 6: [PERSON-2], that's a, oh, yeah. It's all right. I'm scrolling across.
Speaker 6: Can you say?
Speaker 6: Oh, it's your turn.
Agent: Maybe, possibly.
EndUser: Just. Oh, oh, oh, there it is.
EndUser: How about?
EndUser: Yeah, cool.
Agent: Yeah, so
EndUser: There's a whole bunch of different stuff that needs to be done always because these machines, they're really high wearing. So you might have welding repairs that need to be done.
EndUser: Yeah, you might a certain amount of parts that need to be changed out.
Agent: Mainly need to have
EndUser: The actual servicing of the machinery like the [TIME-9] interval servicing. That's the, that's the real easy bit. Everything else is. is
Agent: So it's not so I can see there like so for example you've got like cracks in the chassis where would that be cracks that have actually been seen or is it preventative in nature where you go to prevent cracks
EndUser: I have to change this thing. That one is So if it's in this database, it means that we've collected it from [DATE-6], and then we put it in here.
Agent: It's been seen.
Agent: The reports that come in
EndUser: And then once there's a date closed, and then there's a service report loaded in, that's when the job's
Agent: Completed. Yeah, cool. Thanks.
Agent: I'm curious on the financial side that you have there. So we talked a lot around preventative maintenance and the task that we generated.
Agent: What's the financial side of this?
Agent: Are you calculating depreciation at the moment?
EndUser: In terms of our assets we are, but in regards to the actual maintenance costs, there's no depreciation, it's just a straight moving cost [DATE-10].
EndUser: [DATE-10] are extremely high because a lot of stuff goes wrong and [DATE-10] are, I wouldn't say low, but just normal.
Speaker 6: We're not really sort of tracking it anywhere in here, that financial tab that you can see there is literally just, it's a pre- It's something that's just included in this program and we just all it's used for.
Speaker 6: You have a look as just to put in the invoice number from the purchase, but it doesn't have any functionality to it other than just Recording Okay.
Agent: Some data. No, that makes sense. And so the financials around the assets and the depreciation, is that done [PERSON-3].
Speaker 6: Through an accounting system at the moment?
Agent: Okay, no, no problem. I'm just curious on that.
Agent: In terms of how you go ahead and invoice your, I'm curious actually, how do you know where's the list of all your clients that you have, for example, it seems like [NORP-1] in to be your number.
Agent: One kind, my understanding.
Agent: Like, how do you see all the information around [ORG-1], for example?
Speaker 6: Where do you need to go?
Speaker 6: We don't really have at the moment.
Speaker 6: We run my Oub for our invoice in, so if you want to see anything that we've invoiced, then we can just go into my Oub and have a look at that [DATE-10] or, you know, that financial [DATE-10] invoicing and sort of break it down, as far as keeping sort of client records and things that have been quoted
Agent: Like [PERSON-4]'s quoted or whatever, we don't have that at the moment. Okay, no, that makes sense. Oh, sorry.
Speaker 7: I'll let [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] go. I had a question.
Speaker 7: How do you see all your sites?
Speaker 7: Because you guys work off sites, right?
Speaker 7: So, Do you have like a map view of all your sites or view of all your sites that you work with?
Agent: Do you have a list
Speaker 7: Like especially the ones that are ongoing because I know that you sometimes have contracts with these sites that they have an end date. So do you have a way of viewing all of that or do you just.
EndUser: [PERSON-7] our share drive to be honest, a lot more you do our
Speaker 6: Weekly reporting. Let's, that's it.
Speaker 6: Yeah, I think, I mean, it's quite, we're lucky that it's [PERSON-4] and I, you know, and the two of us are pretty switched on and we just sort of communicate well that we have all this information, you know, in a folder.
Speaker 6: But this is what we're going back to in our original meeting is it would be good to have it. All the information somewhere and easy to find so that somebody can step in and help out.
Speaker 6: So I can have a holiday.
Speaker 7: You're going to where are you going
Speaker 6: To a beach right [PERSON-1].
Speaker 7: That's why my camera is not on. That's where I am now.
Speaker 7: Why are we not at a beach with you?
Agent: I'm curious around a bit more around the business impact. Obviously time is really important for both you, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-1].
Agent: I'm curious, is there any times that you've been rejecting any jobs at the moment because you couldn't find time to
EndUser: Schedule it in or what are some of the implications of not having all this visibility?
EndUser: We're at capacity now, so we could double our business [DATE-13]. If we had the right infrastructure and we could get the right people.
EndUser: The business is at a point now where purchasing machinery isn't really an issue, understanding the process and getting a result for the customer's on an issue.
EndUser: It's more around, I don't want to grow this business anymore and get to a point where I can't actually handle the work. So we're at that point now. If we're going to grow, we need a system.
EndUser: That everyone can use and everybody can grow into. We've been really lucky but really really lucky to have all the work that we've got but the implication of not
Agent: Having a syste m is our growth is completely stunted at this point . Yeah, it makes sense. And I'm curious to know a bit more around numbers as well.
Agent: For those who are kind of managing the jobs currently and like scheduling How many all of these maintenance.
EndUser: People are doing that [DATE-2]?
EndUser: So we've got a supervisor in [GPE-1], a supervisor in [GPE-2]. one supervisor here in [GPE-3], myself, and I said
Agent: Five of us run the maintenance at the moment or schedule the maintenance, sorry for all the sites. Okay.
EndUser: And then what about
Agent: Your, do you call them technicians?
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: What about your technicians?
EndUser: Like, where are they based at the moment?
EndUser: You mentioned, yeah, where are they based?
EndUser: They're all over and sometimes we draw on subcontractors, but also some of our operators are actually technicians. So, yeah, our main ones are [GPE-1], [GPE-3] and Dubbo. but we can draw on other regions if we have to. All
Agent: Right, do you know how many there are roughly of technicians that you have?
Agent: And like we choose your state that is most popular.
EndUser: Including subcontractors or just
Agent: Their employees?
Agent: Let's separate them out of employees and subcontractors because that also impacts the licensing too, but it also just helps me understand the structure
EndUser: Of your business. Yeah, okay. So we would fully hope. Sorry, just let me check more. Sorry, just let me check more. Here we go. One.
EndUser: So we would have. All of our own technicians. Mm And another five regular subcontractors.
Agent: Hmm.
Agent: Mm hmm. Okay, that makes sense. And is that across all states [GPE-4].
EndUser: At the moment?
EndUser: All sites, yeah,
Agent: Okay, yeah, makes sense.
Agent: From there, I'm curious, any of your technicians at the moment, do they fly in and out of job sites?
Agent: Or they're apparently like based in [GPE-1], for example?
EndUser: They're permanently based, however, if we, so say for example, if we've got a big shutdown in [GPE-1] and a lot of work needs to be crammed into [DATE-13] of planned maintenance, we'll call on local subcontractors, all will bring guys from [GPE-3] or Orange or Dubbo or wherever else we can get them from. Okay.
Agent: Do you know how many subcontracts?
Agent: Is the subcontractors the five they've mentioned?
EndUser: Regular subcontractors, yeah, but like sometimes we sometimes we use more but I'd say five on a regular
Agent: Basis. Okay, no, that makes sense. I'm doing that. And when you assign them a job, are they there for like [DATE-14] duration or they're kind of going in and out, depending on [DATE-22].
EndUser: Depends on the tasks that they hope. So when we run an excercerable, we have to work to a particular person. So some guys might stay there for [DATE-14], some might
Agent: Stay for [DATE-21], some might need to be there for a breakdown. Yeah, if that answers your question, it's pretty fluid. No, no, it makes sense from my point of view.
Agent: So we've covered off the types of jobs where your technicians are located at the moment. I'm assuming, and correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of the work that you do is proactive versus reactive,
EndUser: Besides probably some maintenance cases.
EndUser: How scheduling in these jobs and the tasks?
Agent: Far in advance are you
EndUser: Is it like a month out, [DATE-26] out?
EndUser: [DATE-22] out just because
Agent: A lot of stuff changes. So yeah, [DATE-22] out we're generally planning everything.
EndUser: To be honest, and [PERCENT-1] react.
Agent: [PERCENT-2] of it's proactive
EndUser: Ok, do you have any emergency jobs finding chance?
EndUser: All the time.
EndUser: What's an example of an emergency job?
EndUser: A belt might break. might bring the machine to a stop. So we'll need to engage with subcontractor to come out, bring a new belt with them and fit it. And that could be a [DATE-25] process.
EndUser: Could be longer, but call it on average a [DATE-25] process.
Agent: In [DATE-10], we may take that time to work on that machine, things that have been building up over [DATE-31] or what not that we've captured previously. Do you do any workshops, for example?
EndUser: So let's say a machine's broken.
EndUser: Do you need to bring it back into a specific workshop to get fixed and then reinstall a specific part?
Agent: We do, but that's very rare because we try and keep everything out on site. And then we do tend to do mobile work on site. We do, we have done rebuilds in the past, where we've brought back a machine.
Agent: Sorry from top mode back to [GPE-3]. I'm spent [DATE-25] working on the center back out in the field, but that's pretty rare.
EndUser: Okay, that makes sense. And then in terms
Agent: Of managing your inventory that you have on hand in terms of your parts, how are you managing that currently [DATE-2]?
Agent: Through a spreadsheet. Okay, no, I'm curious like, to know, you know, like, how do you know what's been consumed, what's on hand [DATE-2], for example,
EndUser: If any of those maintenance tasks pop up, for example, how
Agent: Do you know what's on hand?
Agent: Is that all done through the spreadsheet?
Agent: Yeah, manual stock take for each site.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: Do any of your technicians have anything like personal on hand or is all the infantry living on a site?
Agent: It's all living on the site. Okay, now that makes sense.
Agent: In terms of your technicians experience, when they go out on site, you mentioned that they're currently Do you care about when your technician goes on site when they've personally checked in, checked out?
EndUser: Writing in when they've...
Agent: Or is there more to do with the asset?
Agent: More to do with the asset. Okay. And so as part of that, as part
EndUser: Of this project as well, do you care about like when your technicians like check in, check out for like time sheet purposes?
EndUser: How are you managing the time sheets?
EndUser: Look, we get a time sheet every, myself. That's our stock take. We We get a timesheet [DATE-4]. So all the guys timesheets every week. Our staff are really good.
EndUser: So there's not a lot of, what's the right word?
EndUser: There is quite a lot of trust getting to site, when they're not getting to site.
Agent: On when they're ringing and asking the questions anyway, but I'm not too concerned about when they get there and when they leave, probably what is done.
EndUser: I'm always
Agent: Okay, that makes sense.
Agent: Is this an example of what a timeshare looks like?
Agent: Correct.
Speaker 6: Yeah, sorry. I had myself on the. Yeah. Yeah, I do a docket [DATE-34]. And if they're
Speaker 6: Good, they give me a see done there. Okay. And then I'll get a time sheet for [DATE-34]. Just as a sort of bit of a check between the dockets, a bit of a summary.
Agent: Oh, no, it's interesting. And then they also do [DATE-6] checklists as well. I see here.
Speaker 6: I'm not. I think. Yeah. I think that's a. Yeah, that's just on our dockets. And it's sort of like just a real quick one. I think
Agent: It's a quick safety. But then there were also dual-imprese starts on all the machines every day. Yeah, that makes sense.
Agent: Are they?
Agent: When how are you currently managing any like instance, for
EndUser: Example, went out on site.
EndUser: It really depends what the incident is. So we tend to fall under the primary contractor or the client's [ORG-2] policies.
EndUser: So if there's an incident, depending on what it is, it may be reportable, it may not be reportable, but it tends to be the discretion
Agent: Of the client, to be honest. Right. Okay.
EndUser: So
Agent: You need to be reporting this to the clients if something happens out on side. Correct. Okay, got it.
Agent: How many instances like a curve on [DATE-36], the basis is it like limited?
Agent: Like I would talk about 10 instances a month
EndUser: Or what some of the things that need to be reported on?
EndUser: So let's have a think. So in [DATE-38], I think we've probably had. It's re-reportable incidences.
EndUser: We can send you a whole bunch of, a whole list of all the stuff that's sort of reportable, but the main ones are machines, machines touching each other or having contact with each other, guarding on machines, guarding on machines, not being present.
EndUser: Dust suppression so you can't walk around the plant without a dust mask on, making sure you have all your PPE so hard, hot, long sleeves etc.
Speaker 6: What else have we
EndUser: Had recently?
EndUser: Mobile phone use. Mobile phone use in ledge, you're not allowed your mobile phone while stopped parading. Yeah, the list goes on to be honest, but we're pretty fortunate that we... Yeah, that we run a pretty good ship.
EndUser: There's a whole bunch of rules around when you want to carry out maintenance. So we can send you all that stuff too long to talk about. But yeah, in terms of actual reportable incidences, we're pretty good. We might
Agent: Get [DATE-45], I think, is probably safe. Hello, that makes sense. I think we've covered quite a lot here. Is there anything that I may have missed as part of that kind of, flow.
Agent: So I went from like more like how do you generate the jobs to begin with to, you know, how do you book them in, for example, all the way to how does your technicians complete them?
EndUser: Is anything I may have missed as part of the conversation?
EndUser: Probably our pre-starts.
EndUser: So [PERSON-8], do you want to bring up some pre-starts just so we can show [PERSON-9] what that looks like?
EndUser: So, prior to any machine working, [TIME-10], pretty starts get filled out. And again, they're in our old school format, which is write it down to piece of paper, scan it in. So this is what they look like.
EndUser: So that one, for example, is an excavator. Obviously nothing wrong with it, it's all ticks. No, it's got the [GPE-5] up the top there, what type of machine it is, the date, the operator that did it.
EndUser: No comments down the bottom. So you would presume that machine is all good to go and there is nothing wrong with it.
EndUser: Now do you want to scroll down for a [ORG-3]?
EndUser: This one for example, down the bottom there, engine was overheating, last driven.
EndUser: So this is where we actually capture a lot of our maintenance issues that go into the next service to report or get loaded into our firemaker system.
EndUser: So this is one of the things that would really like to automate, if possible, just to make out the manual handling. I'll go down again, please. So that one's all good. That one's all good. That one's all good.
EndUser: So these ones are pretty good at the moment. So
Agent: That's probably something that's we need. Do your technicians need to fill this in
EndUser: Every single time they go out on site?
EndUser: [TIME-10]. Yeah. And this is not our technicians. This is it. These are our operators.
Agent: The people actually operating in machines. OK, that makes sense.
Agent: How many operators on site?
EndUser: Do you have then out About 34.
Agent: Ok. Is that across the entire?
EndUser: Organization?
EndUser: Yes, yeah, so we've got about 34 operators, 45 permanent operators, five permanent fitters or technicians and roughly five-ish
Agent: Superstar. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense.
Agent: And in terms of the operators, are they at the moment, in terms of how you schedule them in?
Agent: Just... the operators work on one device and one like one machine only,
EndUser: Or do they kind of work across multiple machines?
Agent: They tend to move around. OK, so you'll have your machines, for example, and the machines will stay put at that particular site. And then depending on who's available on [DATE-44], you'll be scheduling in operators based
Agent: Your
EndUser: On the question.
EndUser: Was that a correct assumption?
EndUser: Correct.
Agent: Yeah. I have a question about the skillset required to either be a technician or an operator.
Agent: Do you hire people with, I guess, that one level of skill that they should be able to do everything?
Agent: Or is there some people that have, you know, when you're going out and saying, okay, I want you on this site, you're on this site, so you need to have these skills.
EndUser: Is that how you work?
EndUser: Or is it just everyone should be able to do everything?
EndUser: It's very specific. So a technician needs to have a, is essentially a diesel plant mechanic or heavy plant mechanic or a auto electrician. An operator is somebody that just has a ticket to operate a particular machine.
EndUser: It's a bit of a funny setup because you may have a ticket to operate an excavator, for example, but part of your role may be to assist in plans maintenance days and do very, very simple sort of maintenance.
EndUser: So, you know, using rattle guns and shoveling and cleaning stuff out. So there is a pretty distinct difference between a technician and an operator and operate a car to a service
Agent: And operate a car. Anything that's in depth or supply.
Agent: And from an operational perspective, they have a ticket to drive a particular machine but can they drive any machine or is it this asset can have an operator that has this particular you know, skill versus this asset that
EndUser: Has an operator that has this particular skill . Each asset needs to, or each operator, sorry, needs to have a particular, for that machine or that type of machine.
Agent: A particular skill So, that operator needs to be ticketed in an ex-girl. Yeah, cool. Cool.
Agent: And then one other question that I had was around like service level agreements with say, like, [PERSON-10], who, you know, one of your customers.
Agent: So do they have expectations on you guys around?
Agent: And level agreements around how quickly you need to be able to fix those cracks in the chassis?
Agent: Do you have service
Agent: Or how quickly you need to do these types of things?
Agent: Or is it kind of managed ad hoc. Yeah, it's very reactive. So depends on the site, depends
Agent: On the urgency and depends on the relationship. To be honest, there's nothing formal. Okay, make sense. Thank you.
EndUser: I'm just curious around your machinery as well.
EndUser: Does your machinery move across different sites, or do they stay put for the most part?
EndUser: Some of them move so We have two sites in [GPE-1] so our machinery there moves from from each site For [DATE-35] [DATE-45] at one at one site [DATE-38] at another Same as out in orange and [PERSON-10] probably [DATE-36] is the split [GPE-2] and [PERSON-10] is probably nine and three [GPE-6] is permanent Where else is permanent that spot and our stuff in [GPE-3] sort of tends to be a bit permanent as well, but they do move like they .
Agent: When I say something's their permit, you'll probably stay there for [DATE-44], move to another site and then go back. But it's not like a fast moving, you're here for [DATE-47] and you're leaving. It's one like that.
Agent: No, no, it makes sense. I'm just curious about, you know, if we're, you know, continue on with this project as well.
Agent: Just to make sure that, you know, when you are scheduling these jobs in,
EndUser: To take into consideration of where the machinery
Agent: Is, for example, and do you need a factor in that part of the scheduling?
Agent: Yeah, definitely, for sure. Okay, no, that makes sense from my point of view. The other question I have do you
EndUser: For individual tasks, require more than one technician or one operator to be out on site?
EndUser: Yes, yeah. Usually we have plans maintenance with God. three or four technicians and all the operators at the same time are doing the maintenance.
Agent: Are they set people as well?
EndUser: Like are they essentially crewed?
EndUser: Do they stick together for the most part?
Agent: But mostly, but if we've got a if we've got a high intensity plan, maintenance schedule, we'll bring others in. Yeah, no, that makes sense.
Agent: But for the most part, you know, a typical site will have your two operators, your one technician, for example. It's typically the same set be typically the same set of people.
EndUser: Of skills or it might
Agent: Is that correct?
Agent: Correct. All right. That makes sense because as part of the [ORG-4] solution, we can manage what we call crews, for example.
Agent: And that means that we can start to schedule in these jobs and number of people at hand when you need to schedule them in.
EndUser: Always ensure that you have the correct
Agent: I think.
Agent: [PERSON-2], do you have any other questions?
Agent: No, I'm good. All good. [PERSON-6], do you have anything from your end as well?
Speaker 7: That I may have missed.
Agent: I think you're. Yeah. I think it's my engine. OK, that makes sense. Probably my last question is just around that invoicing side.
Agent: What do you need information wise to invoice your customers?
Agent: Is it the parts consumed?
Agent: Is it the time taken at [DATE-45]?
EndUser: What are the things that you
Speaker 6: Do to generate invoice?
Speaker 6: With a lot of the repairs and maintenance that we're doing. Where charging that [PERCENT-3] of the time because it's our machinery.
Agent: Only actually
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: [PERSON-10], how, what do you sort of see us needing in that regard?
Agent: Oh, look, it really depends. So if it's contract work, all the repairs
EndUser: Are on us. So we don't generate an invoice back to the customer. If it's wet higher, we may generate a portion of the cost back to the customer and drive higher. Well, again, it's sort of a 60-60.
EndUser: To be honest, it's really fluid. There's some things that the customer's okay to pay for and then there's some that they're not. It may be my operators that damage something so the customer doesn't need to pay for it.
EndUser: Standard scheduled servicing, the customer doesn't pay for because it's captured in the higher rate. Yeah, I'm probably,
Speaker 6: Yeah, that one's a bit of a tough one, to be honest, it's really done on a case by case basis. If we do charge it to generally sort of high wear items like teeth.
Speaker 6: I'm just thinking like What do you call them wear plates in the crushes and that
Agent: Sort of that sort of thing and more charge parts ends. No, no, makes sense.
Agent: It's just good for me to understand, you know, once you've kind of done all these tasks, for example, done all the safety checklists, you know, how do we kind of be that back to the customer, but it just depends on the type of job to.
EndUser: Cool. So, [PERSON-1], do you want to bring up just quickly the, just like a forecast like a skit, like say for barrel or shut forth, the forecast costs and then the charge out costs.
EndUser: So all of these, so this is essentially a schedule, a schedule of maintenance for [DATE-44]. This all gets captured We then generate, we then put that into file maker, we generate it into an [ORG-5].
Agent: From pre-starts and reports.
EndUser: We get the cost of everything or an estimate of the cost, and then we send this to the customer prior to prior to actually carrying out the work.
EndUser: So they get a bit of understanding of how much it's going to cost. There's also the
Agent: Things that we don't charge for in there, and then other things that we're going to bump back to [DATE-45].
Agent: We can send you a copy of stuff like this if you like, but that's how we're doing it at the moment. Okay. No, that makes
EndUser: Sense from
Agent: My point of view there. This is all belonging to the one customer. That's for one site.
Agent: That one?
EndUser: Yeah. Right. Okay. Correctly from wrong with your sites. I'm sorry if this is dumb question.
EndUser: Is one site belonging to one customer?
EndUser: Well, say [ORG-1], for example,
Agent: We're working on six of their sites. So yeah, so they all belong to [ORG-1], but they're all individually managed by a query manager. I understood.
Agent: I was thinking that but I was just before we end the conversation there was just making sure I wasn't asking dumb questions.
Agent: [PERSON-10], there any questions that you may have around numbers?
Speaker 8: Is
Agent: Yeah, and I want to just at a high level go through like what the licensing would look like for you just based on what I've heard in this call, but I had a few additional questions.
Agent: So in terms of the assets themselves, it is optional, but if you want to schedule them like in the actual system, you can essentially get a license for the asset and schedule that.
EndUser: I didn't know obviously how you're doing it [DATE-2].
EndUser: If that's something that you want to look at the phase one, what are your thoughts on that?
Agent: What does that mean exactly getting in with life since for the assets are loading the asset into your system?
Agent: It's more and if let's say you want to around the Field Service capability and we can send you more resources on this as well.
Agent: Is to do with scheduling and part of the solution is around how do we schedule in your technicians your operators to make sure they're out on site.
Agent: So we look at things such as are they in the right location?
Agent: Are they do they have the right skill sets, for example, certifications?
Agent: Do we want to reduce travel times?
Agent: There's a lot of scheduling, basically helps people in the back office find the right operator for a particular job. We can also extend this for your assets too.
Agent: [PERSON-2] and I will need to, [PERSON-6] probably think through the solution a bit more, but just for
EndUser: A high level, that's what we're thinking.
Agent: Yeah, I feel like I kind of
Speaker 7: Get it, but I think I need
Agent: To see how it looks. Yeah.
Speaker 7: Yeah.
Speaker 7: Well, should we just work with you offline just to schedule that demo?
Speaker 7: That way I can just figure out what the team wants [DATE-45] and then come back to you, and I know [PERSON-10] wants to walk
Agent: You through, I think, the thoughts around the solution and the lightening time.
Agent: So is that right, [PERSON-10]?
Agent: Yeah, I was just more so to just confirm the numbers on the back end so we can share some pricing with you prior to the demonstration [PERSON-4].
Agent: So I can leave the assets as a as a question mark The other numbers were 38 operators out on site.
EndUser: For now.
Agent: Is that correct?
Agent: Yep. So all of your operators will require what we call [ORG-4] plus license and essentially gives them access to the system as well as needed to be scheduled if they need.
Agent: I also heard there were five technicians in about five regular subcontractors.
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: And then just on like back office who's doing the actual scheduling, how much I'm assuming like,
EndUser: You know, probably both of you on [DATE-2]'s call and then I'm not sure how many others would need access to that. Look, it's, it's done
Agent: By [PERSON-1] and I in conjunction with our five technicians. Sorry. Yeah. All right. That makes sense. And then is there anyone else we haven't discussed that would need access to the
EndUser: System. Not just yet, I'm not sure if [PERSON-5] has told you, but we're actually part of a group of companies that are looking for a system as well, but we're just trying to get [TIME-1] right first.
EndUser: So we want to get [TIME-1] right for three [DATE-44], and then we can go to the other guys and say, hey, look, this is really
Agent: Working for us. Here it is. I think you need to jump on board, et cetera, et cetera. But yeah, for right now, it's probably just us for [TIME-10].
Agent: Okay, So [PERSON-5] and I will go and get that together.
EndUser: No problems at all.
Agent: Essentially, it's just everyone who needs access to system will need a license.
Agent: There's a few different license types and for the well, we have sort of like a light version of the license so you're not paying what you would be for a full-time employee.
EndUser: Subcontractors as
Agent: And then the second part to is the implementation.
EndUser: Setting up [ORG-6]
Agent: So what we'll probably look to do after [DATE-2] as well is introduce you to a couple of Implementation partners that can help.
Agent: Help scope out the actual build There's two components You purchase the licensing directly from [ORG-6] That will be done via [PERSON-5] And then we bring in an Implementation partne r to look and build .
Agent: Essentially set up the system for you. You can utilize them moving forward for ongoing, like you mentioned with those other companies. If you then onboard other companies in
EndUser: The group, you'd probably go back to that partner to set up a similar system.
Agent: Does that all make sense?
Agent: Do you have any questions from us?
Agent: No, not really, that makes
Speaker 7: Sense. Yep. Okay, awesome. And that's it for [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-5]. Oh, okay, well, it sounds like we need an internal I go back to tears slash [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Discussion before
Speaker 7: So does that work?
Speaker 7: Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Awesome. [TIME-10]
EndUser: To spare. Thank joining and thanks to the Really appreciate your time.
Agent: You both for
Speaker 7: Rest of the team.
Agent: Thanks
Agent: For the information. Appreciate it. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks guys. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""How many instances like a crack on [DATE-36], on a basis, is it like limited? Like I would talk about 10 instances a month or what some of the things that need to be reported on?""
   The customer seemed more engaged as they provided a specific number of reportable incidents they've had in [DATE-38] and listed the main types of incidents, such as machines touching each other, guarding on machines not being present, dust suppression, and mobile phone use.

2. ""How many operators on site do you have then out across the entire organization?""
   The customer seemed more engaged as they provided specific numbers, stating they have about 34 operators, 45 permanent operators, five permanent fitters or technicians, and roughly five supervisors.

3. ""In terms of the machinery, does your machinery move across different sites, or do they stay put for the most part?""
   The customer seemed more engaged as they provided detailed information about which machinery moves between sites and which ones tend to stay put, giving specific examples of site splits and machine types.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales representative did a good job of understanding the customer's current processes and pain points, but there were a few missed opportunities to articulate the value proposition of the seller's product.

1. When the customer mentioned the manual handling of pre-starts and service reports, the sales representative could have emphasized how the seller's product can automate this process, saving time and reducing errors.
2. The customer expressed concern about managing the business growth and the need for a system that everyone can use and grow into. The sales representative could have highlighted how the seller's product can help manage growth by providing a centralized system for scheduling, tracking, and reporting on maintenance tasks, inventory, and invoicing.
3. The customer mentioned the need to reduce travel time for technicians. The sales representative could have explained how the seller's product can optimize scheduling and dispatching to minimize travel time and increase productivity.
4. The customer expressed interest in learning more about the licensing options for assets. The sales representative could have provided more information on how the seller's product can help manage assets, including scheduling, tracking maintenance, and optimizing usage.
5. The sales representative could have provided more information on how the seller's product can help manage inventory, including tracking consumption, ordering, and managing stock levels.

Overall, the sales representative missed some opportunities to emphasize how the seller's product can address the customer's pain points and provide value. By focusing on the benefits of the product, such as time savings, error reduction, productivity improvement, and growth management, the sales representative could have made a more compelling case for the seller's product.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer to this question is unclear. The customer did express a need for a more efficient system to manage their production, maintenance, and invoicing processes, and they showed interest in the seller's product. However, they did not explicitly state whether or not they felt the product met their needs.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. Inventory Management: The sales rep did not spend much time understanding how the customer manages their inventory of parts. The customer mentioned that they do manual stock takes for each site, but it is unclear if there are any specific challenges or inefficiencies they face in this process.

2. Reporting and Analytics: Though the sales rep briefly touched upon the financial side of maintenance costs, they did not delve deeper into the customer's reporting and analytics needs. Understanding what kind of data the customer would like to extract from the system could help in tailoring the solution to better fit their needs.

3. Customer's Group of Companies: The sales rep learned that the customer is part of a group of companies looking for a system as well. However, they did not explore this opportunity further to understand the specific needs and requirements of these companies, which could potentially lead to a larger deal.

4. Integration with Existing Systems: The sales rep did not ask about any existing systems that the customer uses, such as accounting or ERP systems. Integration with these systems could be a key requirement for the customer, and understanding this early on could help in positioning the solution more effectively.

5. User Adoption and Training: The sales rep did not discuss user adoption or training, which could be crucial for a successful implementation. Understanding the customer's expectations and requirements in this area could help in ensuring a smooth onboarding process.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:
- ""Is there any times that you've been rejecting any jobs at the moment because you couldn't find time to schedule it in?""
- ""What's an example of an emergency job?""
- ""How many instances like a crack on a chassis, for example, is it like limited? Like I would talk about 10 instances a month or what some of the things that need to be reported on?""
- ""In terms of your machinery as well, does your machinery move across different sites, or do they stay put for the most part?""
- ""What do you need information wise to invoice your customers? Is it the parts consumed? Is it the time taken at [DATE-45]?""
These questions help the sales rep understand the customer's needs, pain points, and current processes better, which is crucial for identifying customer intent."
video_14196_167_6qr3y000000g3ViAAI,"Agent: Awesome. Yeah, let's do some brief introductions. We've got a few new people in the call that we've had before. [PERSON-1] has joined us from the [ORG-1] team and then we've got [PERSON-2] again who you guys have previously met.
Agent: So, Chip, do you mind doing a quick introduction?
Agent: Sure, I'll do that. So, Chip, I'll sign as [PERSON-3] said, I work on the [ORG-1] technical side. So, I'm a peer of [PERSON-2]. I'm here just to kind of listen in and learn and provide any feedback.
Agent: So thanks for having me. Awesome.
Agent: Thanks so much, [PERSON-4]Agent: And then, [ORG-2], have you been on the other calls too, right?
Agent: Yeah, I'll go ahead quickly introduce myself, Lead Solution Engineer coming up on [DATE-1] with [ORG-3]. Very excited to see how you guys work [DATE-2]. Awesome.
Agent: Thanks. All right, we'll really kind of kick things off. I know I sent over the brunt of what we're looking for within a reverse demo [DATE-2].
Agent: And that's going to be centered around, you know, what measures and fields that you guys are currently using in the [ORG-4] solution [DATE-2].
Agent: Then we'll learn a little bit of clarity on what kind of analysis that you guys are doing in [ORG-5] versus TM1 versus CSV and really what needs to be brought into territory planning.
Agent: And then if you could, we could kind of walk through what an ideal future state is going to be.
Agent: And I'm sorry, [PERSON-3], I just wanted to point out really quickly to the team that I used to sell team one. So if I get nostalgic later, don't
Agent: Yeah, we brought the big gun [DATE-2]. Chip is a principal solution engineer and Five star [PERSON-5] if you can't tell by his little By his insignia, so he's definitely not just here to listen. You're certainly an expert
EndUser: Very cool
Agent: Awesome, so I will pass it off to I guess [PERSON-6].
Agent: Will you be leading this on the arthrex side?
EndUser: Yeah, I'll take it over from here so To be quite honest, because of our issues that we had with territory planning, as well as just where we're at in [DATE-3], we actually hadn't really been performing much with it over [DATE-4].
EndUser: We've actually begun using other tools just solely because of what we spoke about last time. There were gaps that we had. We were running announced in [PRODUCT-1] and [GPE-1], whatever it may be. So, power BI as well.
EndUser: So we ended up swapping over. However, I do. have a use case that we had done back when we had a consultant working with us. We firs t on the territory playing license.
EndUser: I believe it was [ORG-3], or maybe the [ORG-3] affiliat e [PERSON-7] may know better than I, who was a consultant that we had brought on that was able to help u s set up a few use cases.
EndUser: And use case one and two, we were able to achieve. They were rather basic And then use case three was where we got into the nitty gritty of it.
EndUser: And that's where thing s sort of for lack of a better term fell apart for us just probably from a user buy-in standpoint because then they were recognizing that they were [PERSON-8] to do more work than before in order to achieve relatively similar levels my screen and
Agent: Of functionalit we can review that use case thin g. That would be a great place to jump off [PERSON-9]: Y. So I can share
EndUser: That makes sense to me. Yes, absolutely. Great. Awesome.
EndUser: And this is use case three that we're going to be digging into, correct?
EndUser: That's exactly right. And the other ones were very basic. You know, use case one, I believe, was like we have we need to bring in.
Agent: A zip Code file I don't functionality?
EndUser: So know. Are you guys familiar with the zip to turf
Agent: That's at least we were taught it.
EndUser: I don't know if that's a like, they're still naming or if that's what they can tell you the enough.
Agent: Either way,
EndUser: I can show you what I mean. Yeah, I think I know what she's referring to. It was a creative way of explaining it.
Agent: So I'm
EndUser: Not this file. Excuse me. I've got too many things going on.
EndUser: So what we ended up doing, and you can see my screen, correct?
EndUser: Yes. Perfect. So what we ended up doing was in the very first use case, and we mentioned this the last time, but I'll briefly mention it again because I know it's been [DATE-5].
EndUser: We have a zip Code file from [DATE-6] and all of our contracts for our affiliated agencies that sell our products. They use these zip Code files. So our legal binding and agreements are based off of [DATE-6] census [ORG-6].
EndUser: Now, for anyone familiar with [GPE-2] zip codes, they onboard zip codes left and right it seems.
EndUser: So now the zip codes that are in territory planning, which rightfully so are updated all the time, are actually not the zip codes we really want to use.
EndUser: So instead we use what she termed zip to ter functionality, just zip to territory.
EndUser: What we do is we actually load our entire hierarchy where we want the zips to be, whic h for legal reasons our contracts are based off of the district level It's just one level of our hierarchy .
EndUser: And then we assign all the [DATE-6] zip codes there. And so when we create our layers within territory planning, we're doing a few things.
EndUser: We're creating them with the accounts layered onto them, but then all of our boundaries are actually being created through a combination of these zip codes and the assignment of the accounts.
EndUser: So at times we would have violations where perhaps there was an account that belonged to [GPE-3], [GPE-4] now for a business reason.
EndUser: But the zip Code foundry of [GPE-5] So we did was we used this functionalit y in order to override the account assignment s and create our maps largely based around these zip Code s with the gaps being filled in by the assignmen t of the accounts themselves .
Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: So that was really use case one. And that was a core one for us because of our unique situation, the zip codes, we really had to abide by them.
EndUser: Then when we were done with all of our analysis, we would export them, compare them to these zips, and then only send out these zips because these are our legally binding Much more.
Agent: Ones.
EndUser: And [PERSON-10],
Agent: Is there a plan to update the contracts at some point for a way to make them more ambiguous that you don't run into this in the future?
Agent: Or will it always be this way?
EndUser: Well, unfortunately, the legal folks are a little bit pesky about the word ambiguous, you know, right?
Agent: As I'm sure
EndUser: They like things with black and white. So we'll never have that, but them.
Agent: We are looking to update
EndUser: We're actually undergoing a project right now to go to the [DATE-7] census zip Code file.
EndUser: But either way, we end up with this situation that we're in now where [DATE-8] that we onboard these contracts were a new file, they're already the date.
Agent: Outdated. Already on
EndUser: Yeah. Right. So we're always going to have this unique situation with zip codes. And I'm not.
EndUser: Not sure how many other customers using this product have that same scenario, but I woul d imagine that anybody who has legally binding agreements with a distributor or an agenc y type of operation would have something very similar So perhaps it's been felt by others I'm not so sure .
Agent: Yeah, and I can't think of any customers in particular, but we do have plenty of customers that have a distribution system where they do help contracts for what zip codes specific distributor basically owns it.
Agent: But I don't know if you've heard, but I have not heard of any others having this specific of an issue.
Agent: It's only something I'm for.
Agent: Yeah. Interesting. Our lawyers let it be a little ambiguous somehow.
EndUser: I will say too, that we're using this tool and the zip codes that we get as a result of the export of this tool in order to essentially restructure future contracts.
EndUser: So maybe it's possible that other customers are using this more so for operational reasons and we're using it for operational and sort of for in a way legal reasons that is being used in contracts as well.
Agent: Yeah, I think that's where the big difference comes in.
Agent: I think you're absolutely right, [PERSON-10], Most of our other customers are using it internally, right?
Agent: That we're not.
Agent: Where the reps aren't guaranteed a specific set of zip codes. Be some of them. So
EndUser: Yeah. Then that makes a lot of sense to me that that it wouldn't be felt by others. But I will say for us, this is a core thing.
EndUser: Now, the good news is this process that we learned, it works very well. So we've actually not really had any issues with it. We did have a little bit of a failure rate.
EndUser: This is an old fall from way back when you can see 292 So we've since perfected this and we were getting it down to none.
EndUser: And I will say one thing that we love about [ORG-4] is that it's really good at identifying point zip codes, which again, Are you guys.
Agent: I'm not.
EndUser: With those opposed to regular ones .
Agent: Yes, I don't know the exact difference, but I know that they exist.
EndUser: Perfect. So there are like a little points on a map as opposed to an actual geography. So for us, we don't assign those, but in reality, those points in a map exist.
EndUser: And they need to have some form of an assignment. So for us, it's been perfect for cleaning up those, which traditionally we had a little bit messy.
EndUser: Now use case three, which is where I really would like to focus where things sort of went haywire for us.
Agent: Just because this is
EndUser: There's a few things that we go into here, but I would rather just go to the second page.
EndUser: So we created this hypothetical scenario for the consultant, and it was also for me as well in the team, because we were working on this.
EndUser: And the scenario was we wanted to split an existing agency, just called [ORG-7], into two new agencies and dissolve the existing [ORG-8]. So one that's currently there gets split into two, the existing one goes away.
EndUser: Each new agency would have one district, [ORG-7] currently has two, the [LOC-1] and [LOC-2]. Both will be deleted along with the agency.
EndUser: And then we stipulated a goal which was to optimize the size of the territories to be [MONEY-1] and maintain clear boundaries at the district level.
EndUser: One thing that we've had in the past that was always a bit of a.. And issue with any mapping tool was that we could get things to get pretty well balanced, but then you end up with these borders that are just a little bit all over the place.
EndUser: And in terms of cleanliness and growth, it was always better for us to have clean mapping. So then we established the few deliverables to the outline in these sections.
EndUser: And this is really where we ended up not being able to achieve things. So I would be really curious and I could share this document with everyone in the call.
EndUser: Maybe it's something where now there is an upgrade that's been done or in the future one planned and we'll be able to achieve this.
EndUser: But realistically, this hypothetical scenario models perfectly against the most basic use case that we have for a agency transition, which is largely what the tool is looking to So we will be able to achieve this.
Agent: Be used for.
EndUser: Now I will say, you know, [GPE-1], we've got some fans in the call, so that's always great. Right now that's what we're actually.
EndUser: Using for a lot of this analysis because we're just not able to run the same leve l of in-depth granular sales [PERSON-11] s as we are with [ORG-9], I don't know if [ORG-4] level really hi t the level of being an analysis capable too l at that level of granularity where it can go down to things like order s or even product level .
Agent: But realistically, really makes the tool for our sales intelligence team a little And [PERSON-10], yeah, go ahead, [PERSON-15].
Agent: That's one thing that
EndUser: Bit less operable.
Agent: Yeah, go ahead, [PERSON-15]. Yeah, the ship to the ship to
EndUser: The check amount and point one, they're deliverable one.
EndUser: Is that is there one of those per account or how does that process work?
EndUser: Great question. So the way that we have our account set up. is we have a sold to account, which is the parent of a ship to, and the sold to is where we invoice to.
EndUser: So it's where we're going to collect our money from. The ship to is where we ship the product.
EndUser: So as you can imagine, right?
EndUser: Healthcare company, we sell to these large-wing glomerates, like perhaps [ORG-10] out in the [LOC-3].
EndUser: And [PERSON-13] may have one place where they accept all their invoices, but they could have 45 ship to locations for all 45 hospitals that they run.
EndUser: And so we may ship product individually there as opposed to where we bill it. So when we run our analysis, we're running it at the ship to level.
EndUser: Because where we ship to has a lot more value in terms of
Agent: Getting it down to the mini. gritty of what that zip code's performing dollar sign was .
Agent: But when you do the optimization of the district or the territories, though, right?
EndUser: Are you optimizing
Agent: At the SHIP 2 or the Sol 2?
Agent: This SHIP 2 level. Okay, so you could have one rep, could have five [NORP-1] and another
EndUser: One, could have three and.
EndUser: So on, take that off, if you haven't divvied up, is that?
EndUser: Exactly, and not to get too crazy until you're asking them great questions, I think it's worth mentioning as well.
EndUser: We could have an agency that has 45 reps, and that agency may cover 53 [ORG-10] locations, and a separate agency may have a whole bunch of reps and a whole bunch of [PERSON-13] organizations as well.
EndUser: So when we analyze the value of a zip Code or the value of an account, We do it at the ship to level because otherwise some soul twos are they
Agent: Have locations that are being operated upon by multiple districts and by multiple agencies. Okay. Right. So your cleaning, you're doing it at the ship to.
EndUser: When you bring the data to
Agent: Correct.
Agent: Exactly. Thank you. Sir. Go ahead. I know you have a question to it. Yeah, and one of my questions was very similar. I was asking if you're essentially trying to aggregate that Revenue data at the SHIP2 level.
Agent: And that's something I'd like to understand a little bit more. I know in our last call it came out that it was getting so complicated that bringing that Revenue data into [ORG-11] planning was not a time efficient process.
Agent: So I'd like to understand a little bit more about If you're, where does that Revenue data live if it's in ERP and, you know, how, how you're combining different data sources to come up with that number that ultimately needs to be associated with the ship to.
EndUser: Address. It's a great.
EndUser: Yeah, so I can answer what are you asking do it [DATE-2]?
Agent: How we
EndUser: Yes. So the way that it's done [DATE-2] is actually a little bit cumbersome. So inside of [GPE-6], out of [GPE-6], we have all our sales orders.
Agent: Just like I've run
EndUser: And from there, we compile finance data warehouse.
Agent: Them within our
EndUser: And from finance to the warehouse from SQL Server, right down here, we actually integrate that [DATE-9] into our system. So what we're doing is we're generating millions of rows of data [DATE-10] in order to accomplish minor.
Agent: Levels
EndUser: Of sales metrics at the ship Right And those final level of sales metric s are largely things like growth or some focus product s we have that we consider to be high Revenue products .
EndUser: But it's not super granular. It's sort of the bare minimum of what they need for this analysis.
EndUser: Now inside of [GPE-1], which again, it's integrating with the data warehouse, but it's able to operate at a much lower level since it's using a cube technology.
EndUser: It's much better for getting to that real nitty gritty, go to the part level, number, all of that.
EndUser: Well, other things we have direct integrations with our environment and data bricks and we're able to bring in sales data, same thing with the data warehouse for [ORG-5] content.
EndUser: So inside of [ORG-5], we have a much more efficient way of displaying sales data and analyzing it.
EndUser: But unfortunately for territory planning, what we found was that we couldn't leverage So to get around, we averaged an older [ORG-15] that we had, which we call the sales metrics integration.
Agent: [PERSON-15].
Agent: And that's the one that's creating these millions of records a month . I'm at chip how much can we share about what's coming with third group learning.
Agent: It depends on
Agent: Whether or not they've seen the forward looking statements slide. I think you.
Agent: Yeah, does anyone have a forward-looking statement slide handy?
Agent: [PERSON-15], I know you're familiar with. But something that our team is building is the ability to push data flows out of [ORG-5] and into sales planning, which will essentially be the product that encompasses territory planning.
Agent: And that's something that's happening in the near future. So that is something that's coming.
Agent: So I was actually really excited to hear more about the use case because I do think that's going to actually solve several of these problems. Because that's not going to eat up any of the.
Agent: The data and I know that was a concern with you're trying to push all this data into you r CRM. It's time consuming, it's you know, eating up your CRM bandwidth.
Agent: Everything will [ORG-13] e in CRM A, so you won't actually have to push it into like [ORG-3] proper. So that' s something to keep in mind.
EndUser: I don't have [QUANTITY-1] of details on that, but I did want t o share that is something that's coming . Well, that's great to hear. That will definitely be very helpful for us.
Agent: I would wonder, and I know
EndUser: You just said no details, but don't worry, I know that slide you're referencing very well. Yeah, I've been. But I would wonder what the limitations would be on [ORG-15] that can be brought in.
EndUser: So I say that because we have very valuable [ORG-15] at the account level that's very granular and would be excellent this type of analysis. But I'm guessing that there's going to be some form of restrictions on what
Agent: Level of data you can bring from [ORG-15] into territory planning. That's a good question.
Agent: That's certainly something I can ask with our product manager, but because it's coming directly from [ORG-5], I'm not sure there will be that many limitations, but that's certainly something that
EndUser: We can look into and ask our product manager after the call. Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely a fan of not that many limitations if that's because I'll take that.
EndUser: But I would be very interested to know because we have so many things that we could leverage [DATE-2].
EndUser: We have an entire sales snapshot [DATE-2] that's based off of the account level that we roll up to the higher levels if needed. And would just give us the data set already that we could leverage in territory planning.
Agent: That would be something that
EndUser: So that would be great to hear. I would also wonder how that would function with the Things that are kind of core [ORG-4] features.
EndUser: So I think about [ORG-4] I think about the ability to map things to your accounts Be able to use that [ORG-22] on a few different metrics So I would wonder if that [ORG-22] could then be used on serum a metrics
Agent: Yes, I know that was one of the questions that came up.
Agent: So the [ORG-22], you know, essentially if you're pushing the data from [PRODUCT-2] to the account, what you're optimizing are the territories and the territories, of course, consist of accounts.
Agent: So as long as that information is essentially like aggregated up at the account level, you'd be able to optimize on it.
Agent: And do you want to talk more about what those three different pieces of the [ORG-22] like do and refer to?
Agent: I know that was a question that came up.
EndUser: You read my ask again because, and the reason why is, and I think that you'll understand this and the probably has come up before, we're making significant business decisions based off of it.
Agent: Mind. Yep. Cause I was about to
EndUser: So just to have that little one sentence blurb that it gives us about what it is, doesn't really put anyone's mind at ease.
EndUser: So it'd be great if we're able to know how the math is working behind the scenes for it.
Agent: Yeah, and [PERSON-10], do you specifically want to understand the mathematical model?
Agent: Because that is proprietary information, so I'm not sure that's something that our team would be able to share.
EndUser: No, I understand that you wouldn't give away the direct math But I think that there is something to be said about when we have a new user of the tool somebody and we show them about how let's say that we're going to balance this off of our 15 sales.
Agent: Behind it.
Agent: Or we're showing
EndUser: Well, they would like to know what that really means. And to us, the only thing when we can give them is that little one sense that's displayed.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. And so, you know, to be a little more specific, there are three different options in that [ORG-22]. And actually, there's more than that because it's a [LOC-4] diagram.
Agent: But essentially, you can choose to balance territories based on any of those analytic metrics that you're bringing in. So it could be our 13 sales or revenue. And what that's going to do is the territories as they're reorganized.
Agent: The optimization tool is going to prioritize making the territories as balanced as possible on that are full sales.
Agent: It's still going to take into account driving distance if you select the drive time network That's one of the options in the optimization tool .
Agent: But if you ignore the drive time network, then it's going to shuffle around the full sole codes until they are as balanced as possible and the new territories are as balanced as possible on that arch wall.
Agent: So that's just the balanced metric. The next metric is the, gosh, I can't think of the name right now, but it's essentially the size metric, meaning the size of the territories.
EndUser: And so if you choose that
Agent: One, it's, I think it's kind of a path. Yup.
Agent: Yeah, so what that's going to do is it's going to essentially attempt to limit the size of the territories and make sure that there as Chip, please correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is it's the size and the driving distance of the territories.
Agent: So we want to make sure that all the geographic boundaries are essentially touching one another and as tight as possible versus having a territory that could spread out across like
Agent: North
EndUser: [GPE-7], [GPE-8].
Agent: Yeah. And then the third option is continuity. And so what continuity prioritizes is making the minimal amount of changes to your regions.
Agent: So that would essentially say, hey, if we have these tens of codes in this territory, only change nine of them don't change, you know, sorry, only change one of them, leave nine of them, don't change all nine of them.
Agent: So what we want to make sure there is that we're making the least number of disruptions or changes to the existing.
Agent: In the most interesting territories while still making them more balanced on [ORG-15] that balancing metrics I think you said our 11 sales So it still will create more balanced territories, but it's going to do it with the least amoun t of disruption to the current territory assignments as possible .
EndUser: And so time network, this was something I was always asking of me, is it looking at the drive time of all the boundaries or is it looking at the drive time between current
Agent: I'm wondering with the drive
Agent: Accounts within those boundaries?
Agent: Yeah, my understanding is the accounts, right for me.
Agent: But Chip, if I'm wrong, it's
Agent: Yeah, it's basically it takes the drive time between the five closest accounts to each account, if that makes sense.
EndUser: And then it averages them out. Oh, interesting. So it's the five
Agent: [PERSON-22], which makes sense, but that would mean that like in your roller area, it's gonna be a little bit larger.
EndUser: Exactly, yeah, that's exactly the theory. Like the bigger, like [GPE-9]'s drive time numbers would be way higher than [GPE-10] for obvious reasons. Right. Okay. That makes a lot of sense to me.
EndUser: And then ran into a whole bunch was they did enjoy the [ORG-22].
Agent: One thing that we
EndUser: I keep calling it that I'm not sure if that's your No, that's fine. That works. Okay. They kept using the [ORG-22] for balancing things to play with it and see what it was like.
EndUser: And then they would create all these different ones. I forgot what the name is, but there's a window that shows a summary level information of all different balances that you've saved.
EndUser: And you can see how they relate to each other. What they would really love is if there was more detail as well on that screen.
Agent: So is there any ability for us to customize the information that's shown as on like that results summary screen?
Agent: Not there is not, but what I imagine your team could do is essentially push the territories back into [ORG-5] and do additional analysis there.
Agent: You know, if we have some way to say to [ORG-5], all of these accounts belong to this specific territory. you could I think that would make the most sense.
Agent: Go ahead and do analysis in [ORG-5].
Agent: Again, chip correctly if I'm wrong.
EndUser: No, I think that's good. Yeah. Yeah, we wouldn't be able to express more detail. Well, without expressing more detail, are you
Agent: Suggesting there would be a two-way connection
Agent: Between [ORG-5] and territory dumping data into [ORG-14] versa?
EndUser: Planning?
EndUser: It wouldn't just be [ORG-5] you could do vice No.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Oh. You'd have to publish the territories then have those
Agent: First and assignments update and then pull the updated assignments into [ORG-5]. Great.
Agent: But I love what you're reading is that great?
Agent: That's not to say that might not happen at some point in the future, [PERSON-6], but I haven't heard anything about that.
EndUser: Okay, I only asked because this was really another part of the use case as well, right?
EndUser: They wanted to run the multiple scenarios, view the key metrics on them.
EndUser: And the way it was done right now was we would run all seven, we'd pull all the raw data out, then we're back to dumping into [PRODUCT-1], dumping into [ORG-14] in order to really analyze it.
EndUser: We just weren't finding that some of those high level metrics that we were given from the tool were really enough for us to make the concrete business decisions that we were looking for.
Agent: Mm-hmm. Yep, that makes sense. Okay. And the idea here is to compare the different scenarios, not necessarily what we did [DATE-11] versus what we think we're gonna do we're not really looking
EndUser: [DATE-15]. Correct, yes,
Agent: At that.
Agent: So, and what I would say, [PERSON-10], is that you have the full power of [ORG-3] reporting, right, which admittedly isn't as good as [ORG-5], but nonetheless, it's still there to report against any of the territory models that you've designed.
Agent: Oh, model.
EndUser: But you'd have to publish [ORG-22]: No, you just the models themselves are stored as sales force.
Agent: So you can actually run reports on the models themselves after you've optimized them at whatever level you want, as long as you know the ID, I'll find that there's a, there's [DATE-13] [DATE-15] is usually the way we reference that, but you could certainly do it between 78 models like
Agent: If you want.
Agent: And Chip, if it's stored as an object, couldn't they technically pull could, but the documentation, that into [ORG-5]?
Agent: I mean, they probably the documentation, of course, but you probably could pull it in the [ORG-5] if you're better at [ORG-5]
EndUser: Than I.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, [ORG-5] can work with essentially my understanding of any object that lives in [PRODUCT-2]. So that is a potential workaround that we hadn't come across before.
Agent: Yeah, let me find the docs [PERSON-2]
Agent: Should oversee.
EndUser: That would be awesome. Thanks. Yeah, I really appreciate that because that would be something I would definitely do. And while native [ORG-3] reporting is good, [ORG-5] definitely gives you a lot more tools to use with.
EndUser: So I may actually go about using the documentation, but then also using [ORG-5] on that. So I'll see how that runs out.
EndUser: But that would be very nice because the way that we're looking to do is to keep our analysis within the tool.
EndUser: So we just don't want them to have this experience where they're loading a CSV file to recreate the maps, then using the tool, then dumping into [PRODUCT-1], analyzing with pivot tables, throwing into [ORG-14], just creates too many tools going around where we're looking for one solution for them.
Agent: So that's great. That's the way. Yes, and I think what I want to do is if you're open to it, [PERSON-10] is speak with my product manager and see if he's willing to set up [TIME-1] call.
Agent: I think given that you guys are such advanced [ORG-5] users and you have territory planning, I think just putting both of your brains in a room would be really great. You know, because he'd be able to hear kind
EndUser: Of some of the limitations you're having, but also speak to what is being built out and then answer your at this point.
Agent: Questions more fully than then Chip and I can are be great.
Agent: Well, that would
Agent: Yes, I would. I would like
EndUser: That very much. So if you don't mind doing that, that'd be awesome. I'm volunteering
Agent: Him. He's involved. Hold.
EndUser: Well, that's how we all do things.
Agent: I guess the companies right now, it's not everywhere, isn't it?
Agent: Well, I'll say it was [PERSON-1]'s idea. Okay, great. That's perfect. Okay, great. Is there anything else that you potentially
EndUser: Wanted to show us [DATE-2]?
EndUser: Or do we think we want to maybe end a little bit early and then schedule something product manager [PERSON-15]?
Agent: Else with with our Well, let
EndUser: Me look [TIME-2] at I'm invite you had posted a few at least addressed them.
Agent: Questions. Let me make sure I have
EndUser: We did have a few on there, you're right. Oh! You told me to serum A, [GPE-1]. Okay, so we have touched upon all of these.
EndUser: So, realistically, the ideal future state is we've sort of already been hitting on it, and you guys mentioned it here as well.
EndUser: We want the Interaction between serum A and territory planning, just that we don't have to go through these old integrations, creating records, and then analyzing against non-granular data. So, I think we have covered everything.
EndUser: So, I'm perfectly fine with going over
Agent: In the next meeting maybe seeing if But if you guys have any questions for me I'm more than happy to answer them as well .
Agent: We can get any more information
Agent: [PERSON-2] and Chef curious with a roadmap item of the ability to play with [ORG-5] and sales planning and that connectivity.
Agent: Is there something that we're going to be able to demo in the near future?
Agent: I'm just curious like timeline if maybe we couple [PERSON-15] might be able to [PERSON-3].
Agent: I think I have things some stuff he has done And I don't know if it's you know, it may be mocked up I don't know where it's at in the real scheme of things, but I've seen some things where it's hey click this link and boom suddenly I'm I'm doing [ORG-4] with a few clicks.
Agent: So So anyway, I don't know that I don't know the back end of that.
Agent: I just know he's shown a couple other people.
Agent: It to me and
Agent: Yeah, I'm just thinking. Yeah. Go ahead.
Agent: Well, I was just thinking for this next session, if we kind of maybe the first half is spitballing between [PERSON-15] and [PERSON-10] on potential ideas of how to use [ORG-5] and territory on the back half that we're able to, I don't know, with time learning, like maybe show the future road mass stuff that's going planning, and then maybe
Agent: To be included to connect those two environments. Yeah, I can certainly ask [PERSON-15] when I speak to him, like they [DATE-15], but has anything that's like a demo ready.
Agent: I can certainly ask if he I know that we as pollution engineers don't have access to it.
Agent: Yeah, and this may be something that we have to wait until, you know, [DATE-22] or [DATE-15], but just wanted to put a possibility.
Agent: It out there if we can maybe see if that's I would also love to see it.
Agent: But it's coming quickly sooner
EndUser: Than later, which is very exciting.
EndUser: Why do we look forward to it?
EndUser: Because that really is our main roadblock. I mean, the fact of matter is [ORG-14] good when we were using it [DATE-14], for carving But it was missing that analytical component to it.
Agent: Tool was very
Agent: Out maps.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: And that really did our roadblock because it just, it stinks from a user perspective to be doing your analytics elsewhere, come here to carve your map, dump it out so you can do your analytics again, bring it back to the tool to carve out a new map.
Agent: It's just going back and forth so it doesn't create the best experience for us to get the buy-in. .
Agent: Well, you know, as a as a as a stopgap to that to [PERSON-10], right the document I just sent to [PERSON-14] and [ORG-14] internally.
Agent: And it talks it's really meant for like a game loss report, right?
Agent: Show me as a rep what what. what accounts I gained or lost [DATE-14] or plan over plan.
Agent: But I'm sure you can look at the fields on the object and look at what's going on and figure out for yourself what other things you might want
EndUser: To show and how else you might want So if you can handle [GPE-1], you can handle the changing.
Agent: To compare it.
EndUser: Well, we are big [ORG-17] one fans over here, although
Agent: I will mention we're looking quickly towards moving away
EndUser: From it towards [ORG-26] the buy and I'm [ORG-26] I mean, there is a reason I'm no love with [ORG-21] [PERSON-10].
Agent: [DATE-22]. So we have all May right now.
EndUser: And that's really, yeah, I was gonna say it's not the most fun tool to have to support when people have
Agent: Bugs that [ORG-21] introduces and did [ORG-17] one it is quite a mess and they last forever. They never seem to be resolved. Yeah. Oh my God. That doesn't sound great.
Agent: No, I was really excited when I heard that you guys are some type of your amie users and have [ORG-4] aside. There's a lot coming [DATE-15] that we're excited about.
EndUser: And again, I wish I could speak to
Agent: It more specifically, but we will, we will get you
Agent: In the room with the people who can. Perfect. Well, thank you very much for that. I look forward to it. Yeah.
Agent: Thanks for your. Yeah, [PERSON-3], anything else that you wanted to add or questions or anything. Yeah, nothing really on my end. Just we'll work on getting those next steps set up.
Agent: So we'll get with [PERSON-15] and [PERSON-14]'s team and see what works for everybody's calendars
Agent: So we can kind of conversations around [ORG-5] and territory
EndUser: Continue these
EndUser: Playing.
Speaker 8: Awesome.
Agent: Awesome. Sounds good, [PERSON-22].
Agent: Great.
EndUser: Thank you very so much. Have a great rest",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""And this is use case three that we're going to be digging into, correct?"" The customer showed engagement by confirming and expressing excitement about focusing on this use case.
2. ""But realistically, this hypothetical scenario models perfectly against the most basic use case that we have for an agency transition, which is largely what the tool is looking to be used for. Now I will say, you know, [GPE-1], we've got some fans in the call, so that's always great. Right now that's what we're actually using for a lot of this analysis because we're just not able to run the same level of in-depth granular sales analyses as we are with [ORG-9], I don't know if [ORG-4] level really hits the level of being an analysis capable tool at that level of granularity where it can go down to things like orders or even product level."" The customer seemed engaged as they discussed the tool's capabilities and their current use of [GPE-1] for analysis.
3. ""And Chip, if I'm wrong, it's basically it takes the drive time between the five closest accounts to each account, if that makes sense."" The customer showed engagement by asking for clarification and confirming their understanding of the drive time calculation.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer had issues with territory planning and had to use other tools like Power BI and [PRODUCT-1] due to gaps in the previous version of the seller's product.
2. The customer had concerns about the complexity of aggregating revenue data at the SHIP2 level and wanted to understand how the revenue data is combined from different sources.
3. The customer was interested in knowing the limitations of the data that can be brought from [ORG-15] into territory planning.
4. The customer wanted to understand the mathematical model behind the [ORG-22] feature in the seller's product.
5. The customer wanted more detail on the results summary screen of the [ORG-22] feature.
6. The customer wanted a two-way connection between [ORG-5] and territory planning for better analysis.
7. The customer was looking for a one-solution approach and did not want to use multiple tools for analysis.

The customer's main roadblock was the lack of analytical capabilities in [ORG-14] and the back-and-forth process of doing analytics elsewhere, carving maps, and then bringing it back to the tool for further analysis.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: Based on the transcript, it is unclear if the right decision maker was on the call to move the deal forward. The customer mentions that they have been using other tools due to gaps in the seller's product, and they have not been performing much with the seller's product over a certain period. The customer also mentions a use case that they had achieved with a consultant's help but faced issues with user buy-in. However, there are no explicit statements indicating the absence or presence of the decision maker.

The agreed-upon next steps include the seller's product manager having a call with the customer to discuss potential ideas on how to use the seller's product and territory planning. The seller will also check if there is a demo ready for connecting the two environments. The customer is looking forward to this as their main roadblock is the lack of interaction between the seller's product and territory planning.

The customer also mentions that they are big fans of a certain tool but are looking to move away from it towards another tool. The seller expresses excitement about this as they have a lot coming up that they are excited about.

In conclusion, while the next steps are clear, it is unclear if the right decision maker was on the call.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They expressed excitement about the potential integration between the seller's product and their current system, and looked forward to continuing the conversation with the seller's product manager. However, they also mentioned that their main roadblock was the lack of connectivity between their current analytics tool and territory planning, which they hoped would be addressed in the near future. Overall, they seemed interested in moving forward with the deal, but wanted more information and demonstrations of the proposed solutions.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not seem to feel that the seller's product currently meets their needs. They mentioned that they had begun using other tools due to gaps in the seller's product and that they had not been performing much with it over a certain period. However, they do have a use case from when they had a consultant working with them, which they would like to review.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the ability to push data flows out of [ORG-5] and into sales planning, which would solve several of their problems. They mentioned that this feature would allow them to avoid eating up their CRM bandwidth and having to aggregate Revenue data at the SHIP2 level, which they found to be cumbersome. The customer also mentioned that they were looking forward to the integration between serum A and territory planning, as it would address their current roadblock of having to go through old integrations and analyze non-granular data.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current use of the seller's product and their experience with it. The customer mentions that they had issues with territory planning and had to use other tools, but the sales rep does not inquire further about these issues or the customer's experience with the other tools.
2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's use case and specific needs. While the customer does share a use case, the sales rep does not ask follow-up questions to understand the details of the customer's requirements or how the seller's product could better meet their needs.
3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's decision-making process and timeline for purchasing. The customer does not mention any specific timeline or decision-makers, and the sales rep does not ask about these important factors.
4. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's budget for purchasing the seller's product. The customer does not mention any budget constraints, and the sales rep does not ask about this important factor in the purchasing decision.
5. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with competitors' products. The customer does not mention any competitors, and the sales rep does not ask about this important factor in the purchasing decision.

In general, the sales rep could have asked more open-ended questions to better understand the customer's needs, pain points, and decision-making process. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their pitch and provide more value to the customer.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. The customer has already begun using other tools due to gaps they experienced with the seller's product, specifically mentioning Power BI and [PRODUCT-1].
2. The customer had issues with territory planning in the past, which led to the use of other tools.
3. The customer had a specific use case (use case three) where they faced difficulties, mainly due to user buy-in issues when requiring more work for relatively similar levels of functionality.

These concerns suggest that the customer has had negative experiences with the seller's product and has already started exploring alternative solutions. Addressing these concerns and demonstrating how the seller's product can effectively address these pain points will be crucial to moving forward in the sales process.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""And this is use case three that we're going to be digging into, correct?""
2. ""Are you familiar with the zip to turf functionality?""
3. ""Is there a plan to update the contracts at some point for a way to make them more ambiguous that you don't run into this in the future?""
4. ""Or will it always be this way?""
5. ""Maybe it's something where now there is an upgrade that's been done or in the future one planned and we'll be able to achieve this.""
6. ""But realistically, this hypothetical scenario models perfectly against the most basic use case that we have for an agency transition, which is largely what the tool is looking to be used for.""
7. ""So we will be able to achieve this.""
8. ""But realistically, most of our other customers are using it internally, right?""
9. ""That we're not.""

Agent: Again, I know you have a lot going on, so I'm happy to chat with you guys and really talk through some of the options that we laid out.
Agent: So I guess it might be helpful just to kind of recap like where we are. So I know we have the renewal coming up [DATE-1].
Agent: And due to the sales force in price increases across the board, right, there's going to be a roughly like $[MONEY-1] spend added on to that renewal.
Agent: And as is, but we have to pull around adding some new product that you guys, you know, could use to help obviously further the business. So here's the bay.
Agent: To help with the business and really wanted to talk and dive into a little bit more around ad studio and to run you through a quick demo and kind of talk a little bit around how we see us being able to have us make sense to really help [ORG-1] as well as the stadium and kind of connect to your advertising with your current email campaigns.
Agent: So that's what we wanted to talk about.
Agent: Is there anything else that you guys wanted to kind of call out out of the top of the call?
Agent: No, good.
EndUser: Think we're good at.
Agent: Ok, all right, awesome. All right, so I guess with that, I'm [PERSON-1], who I believe you guys have all met before. We've met a couple of times.
Agent: Sure. All right, thanks for your time again, everybody. And we're going to walk through [PRODUCT-1] advertising. I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.
Agent: If I can just get a thumbs up or a verbal once it comes through for everyone. Perfect. Thank you awesome.

Agent: All right, so we're talking about Marketing Cloud advertising [DATE-2]. And really, when we think about why Marketing Cloud advertising, it's to meet customer expectations of having that unified experience across different channels.
Agent: And the benefit of advertising here in Marketing Cloud is it is a seamless experience to integrate that with your other channels that you are currently actually out of Marketing Cloud engagement.
Agent: So we have our usual suspects of email or mobile, which would include SMS, WhatsApp, push, et cetera. And we can very easily curate first party data-driven advertising audiences out of Marketing Cloud engagement as well.
Agent: Data is our number one most valuable commodity in the world.
Agent: Fun fact for [ORG-2], it actually surpassed oil [DATE-3] in terms of the monetary value worldwide, but data is only as good as what you can do with it.
Agent: And so with the data set that [ORG-3] has, we want to be able to take that and easily, securely, and scalably put it to work for you for paid digital advertising initiatives.
Agent: And I kind of think of those in three buckets. We're going to have it be for some look-alike modeling for new fan acquisition. It can be some suppression.
Agent: So anybody who is currently a season ticket holder, for example, let's not show them season ticket holder ads. Doesn't make sense. They already have it. And then also in the middle would be nurture.
Agent: So being able to extend our email Outreach to be email plus paid digital, email plus SMS, plus paid digital, what have you. We're going to take a look at the process of building out one of those advertising audiences.
Agent: And it's a really easy process to do. If you can drag and drop, you can create an advertising audience. Conceptually, all advertising is here is a secure API.
Agent: It takes your first party data, it ships it up to the walled gardens with bank level encryption. Really easy, you can set it up in [DATE-4]. The Implementation guide is the shortest I've ever seen at 18 pages.
Agent: Most of our customers can get it up and running within [DATE-4] or two and start seeing value within [DATE-5] from having an exaggeration and market with this tool being functional for them.
Agent: So here on our home screen of [PRODUCT-1] advertising, we have a list of all of our audiences in the middle.
Agent: And you can see down here on the left, the networks that we are able to push audiences out to.
Agent: So [ORG-4], aka Meta, and all of its properties underneath it, which would include [ORG-5], [ORG-6], now known as [PRODUCT-2], [ORG-7], and all of its properties underneath it.
Agent: [PERSON-2], and then also [PRODUCT-3] platforms like [PRODUCT-4], new star and trade desk. And so after we set up an audience, we can set it to automatically refresh for us.
Agent: So that way the audience is fresh within each of these walled gardens.
Agent: And we don't have to then manually go extract data again and then pass it out to [ORG-4] again, manually extract data [DATE-6], maybe risk PII exposure, and then pass it out to the network [DATE-7] after that.
Agent: We save a lot of manual effort by automating that with the secure scalable integrations of [PRODUCT-1] advertising. And that's all for [PERSON-3] . So we're going to create a new audience. So let's call it our look-alike audience.
Agent: We're going to take this and send it out to [ORG-7], for example.
Agent: And we're going to take this first party data that we have and make a new audience to connect it and send it out to [ORG-7] for look-alike modeling. for new subscriber acquisition.
Agent: So any data extension that you have here in [PRODUCT-5], wherever it may be from, you can leverage that to fuel the audience. I'm gonna grab our contacts from [LOC-1] for illustrative purposes here.
Agent: And then we're just going to do a quick mapping exercise of the source attributes we have on the left for in our contact data extension here mapping them over to [ORG-7].
Agent: We're going to do this based off of contact info and you'll see now the endpoints that [ORG-7] makes available populate.
Agent: I just drag and drop and I'm done the more data points I have about my subscribers and my fans obviously the higher match rate and then I just save and activate the audience.
Agent: And that's really it to create what I would call evergreen audiences.
Agent: So evergreen audiences here are going to be your lookalikes for customer acquisition, take your ideal customer profile, your ideal fan profile, and ship it out for news fan acquisition initiatives. And then also suppression.
Agent: So I think you guys, when we spoke before, you may recall that if you don't, I was the director of marketing prior to joining [ORG-8], and I actually didn't have [PRODUCT-1] advertising, and I wish I did.
Agent: Because I actually had a question [DATE-8]. I said, you know, I wonder how many of my new quote unquote new customers are actually existing customers clicking on my acquisition campaigns again and wasting my money.
Agent: So I did a line-by-line analysis for [DATE-9] and I found that [PERCENT-1] of what I thought were new customers were actually existing customers wasting my money.
Agent: And I didn't have a manual way of suppressing acquisition ads from existing customers are suppressing [DATE-10] ticket holder ads from [DATE-10] ticket holders or I know what you guys call them flex game packs multi game packs whatever in the case maybe whatever lingo you use to suppress them from scene ads that they've already seen before and with Marketing Cloud advertising for some of these evergreen audiences it's really straightforward to have it be sort of set it and forget it to really control the advertising experiences that your fans are seeing.
Agent: And then the last component of what I wanted to cover here is how we can stitch paid digital advertising in alongside nurture campaigns.
Agent: And how easy that is to do with the advertised market cloud advertising being a portion of journey builder has well. So we have here an example journey that I put together for our conversation [DATE-2].
Agent: Let's say we have a journey we want to send out to get some laps to [DATE-11] reengaged. People who haven't attended a game in [DATE-10], [DATE-18], whatever interval you want.
Agent: We can whatever entry source we specify invite them to come do another game with email. If they clicked on it, maybe we want to offer them [PERCENT-2] promo in case they haven't purchased yet.
Agent: But what if they didn't?
Agent: If they didn't click on that email, maybe email is not the right channel to reach out to them on. We can very easily bring in paid digital advertising audiences into this canvas.
Agent: So that way, anybody who does not click on this email, we can change up our channel mix to have paid digital advertising now be our method of Outreach to hopefully get them to come back and engage with us.
Agent: And when our customers bring in paid digital advertising alongside email here, most of our customers see an increase of [PERCENT-3] in the likelihood to buy [PERCENT-4] increase in audience reach.
Agent: So we think about the number of touch points or impressions and [PERCENT-5] increase 3.452601825342960 times higher return on ad spends is going to make your dollars more efficient for you.
Agent: And [PERCENT-6] increase in your qualified lead conversion rates, especially for some of those sales motions that are more white glove, personal touch, like season ticket holders, being able to extend those touch points from being just email or owned channels to include paid channels as well.
Agent: It's going to really be a impactful addition to the [GPE-1] football club, the bag of tricks within marketing cloud.
EndUser: And so that's really what we wanted to cover [DATE-2] going to bring in there.
Agent: With marketing cloud. I'm just
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: What's up [PERSON-4]?
EndUser: Yeah. I just had a question on this process.
EndUser: So would this require that there's already a live campaign running on, let's just say, like meta properties, when this original email goes out and then sales forces updating that audience for targeting or what I need to come back in here
Agent: And download new audience and add to that campaign. Yeah, good question. So all of your campaign set up for your day, partying, bid management, creative, etc. All that's done in your walled garden du jour.
Agent: And this just automatically updates the audience for you.
EndUser: Anybody who's in anybody who's out.
Agent: But it would need to be live. Yeah, for it to actually show an ad. Yeah, you can push an audience to the walled garden without having a campaign Right.
EndUser: There.
EndUser: But why?
Agent: So we want to make sure there's a campaign ready to receive it.
Agent: That's really what we wanted to cover [DATE-2] with [PRODUCT-1] advertising.
Agent: You can see it's a really simple product conceptually, but a really impactful product as well to be able to extend your reach of first party data monetization, if you will.
Agent: To efficiently drive new fan acquisition and suppression campaigns, as well as nurture across various stages of the fan lifecycle.
Agent: So as we kind of wrap up our portion of the demo here [DATE-2], I want to kind of pass the mic to the [GPE-2] football club team.
Agent: Have you guys thought about any tools like this or use cases like this?
Agent: Maybe how are you actioning it [DATE-2]?
EndUser: I think our paid advertising right now is pretty limited. It's limited to paid social and [ORG-7], kind of the standard places. We've heard around with programmatic, like with [PERSON-5] and things like that.
EndUser: Never really got moving in those, because we're not really meeting those minimums. We're not going to be working with the trade desk or something like that at this point. We're just not there yet.
EndUser: So actually I would be interested to hear a little bit more about the programmatic side of this and who you're working with and if, you know, your, how would you compare like the lookalikes you're able to develop compared to say like the trade desks or you kind of working in the same family drawing from the same data and it'd be similar.
Agent: Yeah, so we actually within [PRODUCT-1] advertising don't house any look like models of our own. We pass the data out to whatever and destination. And then you used to look like modeling in said and destination.
Agent: So whatever look like models are present in [ORG-4] or [ORG-9], [ORG-6], you know, live ramp, etc. Those models would just action off of the data that we are providing through [PRODUCT-1] advertising. Don't you.
Agent: [PERSON-6], I'm curious to you as you think about your marketing strategies for [DATE-10].
Agent: Are you guys thinking about orchestrating multi-channel experiences for fans?
EndUser: Well, I'll just reiterate what [PERSON-4] said is that a huge budget expense is not ever been in the cards for us. We're talking in the three two four figures. for [DATE-18] here, not nothing major.
EndUser: So again, there hasn't been like this overarching, and also even less on resources and staffing and everything else, right?
EndUser: So this overarching kind of multi-channel, omni-channel kind of thing that is possible. It's something that we're just starting to kind of put our efforts towards. So this is all kind of new for us. It's been very piecemeal
Agent: Kind of before. So this is kind of step one exploring what the ecosystem could potentially look like for us. Perfect. Well, as you saw in the demo, it's a really easy tool to use.
Agent: It's something that could make that process and that strategy really quick to action going forward.
Agent: I'm curious as you think about [DATE-10], what sort of [DATE-18] spend are you thinking for paid digital advertising, which would include social and search?
EndUser: He said three two four figures.
EndUser: So would that be a thousand?
Agent: Like 285 to
EndUser: Or are we talking like 110,000 range?
EndUser: Yeah, I'm sorry for the background noise. My budgets are still kind of up for grabs right now. I just had a meeting prior to this one about those numbers. It's still a work in progress, let's say.
EndUser: And a lot of it isn't necessarily ours. In the past, we have done a lot of partner work. So running ads on behalf of our partners. So that's going to That's going to change [DATE-10] as well.
EndUser: Some partners are leaving, some are staying. And again, we've gotten funds from the [ORG-10] to run certain initiatives, but again,
Agent: It's kind of we ask and then we see what we get.
Agent: So the planning part of it right now is kind of up the grabs. Okay. I appreciate that color. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks, [PERSON-6].
Agent: So yeah, so when I think of [ORG-3] and understanding the budgeting that you're working within, to me like that the ad suppression, use case makes the most sense just to make sure you're being as intentional with your ad spend as you possibly can be.
Agent: But understand that it's kind of a work in progress if you will.
Agent: But are there any other questions around this tool?
Agent: What are your current thoughts right now?
EndUser: Again, knowing that, We're up against a relatively tight beat deadline with the renewal and [DATE-10]. Just want to kind of pick your brain, [PERSON-7],
Agent: And see where you're at. Yeah. And just to get more clarity here, how much is advertising the studio, if we were to bolt it on.
Agent: So what I did for this was put together like a package deal, if you will.
Agent: So I think there were a couple of different elements within it, right?
Agent: Because essentially in order to, right now, like your incremental spend would be [MONEY-2] for no new product, except for a couple of contacts that you need, right?
Agent: Get to that [MONEY-3] threshold. And then to kind of negate the sales force mandated upgrades or [ORG-11] increase that we're seeing across the board.
Agent: Board would kind of require a 30k incremental spend [PERCENT-2] of your all of you r renewals right so essentially what I did was I packaged togethe r advertising studio, additional context to get to 1.5 million.
Agent: Intelligence reports advance, which you can also talk to next, which is really around, you know, again, lives and [PRODUCT-1] engagement.
Agent: No implementation, we're really focusing on like what are going to be like the low lift high yields opportunities that you guys have to add on to make sure like if you have to spend [MONEY-4] with us, I would rather spend dollars that are going to get you something right like that's kind of like [ORG-7] I was wanting to put in front of you right so absolutely we just reviewed and television reports calling would be a little bit more in your wheelhouse around maximizing like message in-patch with insights analytics customized to your business needs so really getting you more like Dashboard capabilities .
Agent: I'm going to really help understand the performance metrics and then Marketing Cloud shield. which is really just provides trust and encryption solutions.
Agent: And the last piece would be the 10 distributed marketing licenses from our earlier conversations, right, understanding that there's some interest there. So packaging all of that together was $[MONEY-5].
Agent: And I think advertising studio out of the box less priced is $[MONEY-6] to give you kind of clarity on what we're trying to do here is really kind of bring down the cost as much as possible and give you guys as many new low lift products as possible.
EndUser: Makes sense to me. Appreciate being clear on the packaging and already that you've done, so thank you for that.
Agent: Ok,
EndUser: I have the information I need.
EndUser: I think [PERSON-6], we just need to circle up with the rest of this team, decide if we want to move forward with not only advertising studio, but the other pieces as we want to make that move with that $[MONEY-7]
Agent: Well, and see if
EndUser: And I think what would be helpful is if, because I think you already sent me one. Did you already send me one order form that had the package and one that didn't
Agent: Or which one did you already send me?
Agent: No, so I sent you kind of like an email with like essentially like the 30k and like the description of like what the four or five would be And then I spent you just like then I think I just sent you like the written the renewal order form As is I believe I can go back and double check.
EndUser: Different line items
Agent: I know it's been [DATE-26], but I can circle back on that Um, would it be helpful if we just go quickly into what intelligence reports advanced laws is to show you While we have a little bit time left from the call .
EndUser: I'm good to dive into it. Yeah, just to see just to give me a little bit.
Agent: What we're looking at. And then I think no matter what.
EndUser: Yeah, Yeah, that's perfect. I think no matter what, just be helpful. If you send me like the, if you did already, I didn't seem to apologize, but the one flat renewal and then the one with the
Agent: K package, just so we can take on both of those.
Agent: Totally. I can build up both of those options for you. No problem. Perfect. Cool. I'm passing Thank you.
EndUser: It to you. Awesome.
Agent: You should be seeing my screen again.
Agent: Can you get a thumbs up or a verbal that is coming through?
Agent: Perfect. All right. Come through. So, thank you, sir. So, we have [ORG-10]. Is something you already have [DATE-2]. It's basically some out-of-the-box dashboards across email.
Agent: You get some out-of-the-box dashboards for email, some out-of-the-box dashboards for push. And you can run pivot tables and export things as CSV or PDF. Now, where [ORG-18] stops from a dashboard standpoint is the dashboards are fixed.
Agent: You can't tweak them at all. But with [ORG-18], one of the benefits of it is you can tweak any of the dashboards that you have available.
Agent: So if I think about coming in to say in my email overview dashboard, I'm no longer limited to the out of the box visual as compelling as it may be. Maybe I want to customize it for my business.
Agent: I can come in and make any tweaks that I desire.
Agent: If I want to add a new widget to the page and we have some out of the box chart types that we can drag onto the canvas, bring in any filtering that we would need to bring in.
Agent: So I can very quickly come down here and say put together a donut chart for my overall engagement score the business or how the engagement score is in marketing cloud, the [PRODUCT-6] component, for example, of how we are quantifying overall engagement for our customers.
Agent: But if I wanted to, what I could also do is not just create new widgets, but also create net new fields if I needed to.
Agent: So if you're familiar with the syntax of anything in [PRODUCT-7] with sums and averages and arithmetic computations, min, [PERSON-8], things like that, you can create any net new measurement that you would need to.
Agent: Or based off of dimensions as well, start to do maybe some banding or tiering of your subscription base to see how they are performing.
Agent: So it opens up a new layer of customization within your dashboards as one component of [ORG-10].
Agent: Another component of it that is kind of nerdy but actually brings a lot of power is the query engine.
Agent: So if you wanted to extract any data on the backend of Marketing Cloud with just what you have [DATE-2], you're going to have to go to automation studio, write a SQL query, generate an extract.
Agent: Well, with the query builder here, you don't have to write SQL if you don't want to.
Agent: You can, based off of any data set that you have in your environment with any of your data extensions, create a query and say, I want these dimensions from whatever data set I have in here.
Agent: So, sample something from all subscribers. I can pull any of the fields from the all subscribers data extension, for example. I can do the same thing for dimensions and measures.
Agent: I can filter it and then preview what the query is going to look like before extracting it manually or scheduling that extract on an automated basis. So if you don't like SQL personally, not my favorite.
Agent: Some people love it. More power to them. You can do all of this without having to touch any SQL on the back end.
Agent: But I think where the real power of Marketing Cloud intelligence reports of hands comes into play is what we call our cross channel apps here at the top of the screen.
Agent: So [PERSON-6], as you were talking about being able to just get into how do we think about cross channel experiences for our fans?
Agent: You can't manage what we can't measure as the axiom goes. And so what we want to do is empower you guys with these out of the box dashboards with cross channel insights.
Agent: So we think about how are our channels working together?
Agent: Are we seeing any synergistic lifts of 1 plus 1 equals 3?
Agent: So these out of the box dashboards are going to give you some of those insights at your fingertips. So we have here, for example, [ORG-18], [ORG-7], and Marketing Cloud stack very similar to yours.
Agent: We can engage and evaluate all of our campaign performance underneath it and get all the way down to the creative level within these different walled gardens that we're actually campaigns on.
Agent: To see how our performance is going across KPIs that we care about.
Agent: In addition to that, we can start to without a locked dashboards, see how our campaigns are performing over time, where we're getting peaks and valleys of [ORG-18] or [ORG-10], whatever metric we may care about, how our spend is trending over time, or we're projected to go over or under budget.
Agent: And then based off of this dashboard that kind of shows various flights overlaid with each other, are we seeing those synergistic lists?
Agent: Yes or no?
Agent: And there is AI in here too as well. Everybody's talking about generative [PRODUCT-6]. There's predicted [PRODUCT-6] built into these applications as well.
Agent: And I think of the AI here as being an extension of your marketing team, making your teams more efficient and effective.
Agent: So instead of trying to extract the data, and put it in the pivot table, and then try to sort through what's hot and what's not, trying to find the blips on the radar.
Agent: The [PRODUCT-6] engine in [ORG-26] is going to surface those blips on the radar for you and make recommendations on what you should do. OK, so I need to pause this acquisition campaign in [ORG-7].
Agent: Well, why is that?
Agent: It uses the same landing page as a different campaign, which actually has a better cost per acquisition. And the overall spend is higher here versus other campaigns. Oh, cool. That's a great suggestion.
Agent: And so instead of me having to go and find those insights on my own, they are proactive. to me with these out of the box dashboards and out of the box [PRODUCT-6] widgets at my fingertips .
Agent: And the last part of it within all these different apps that we have available is with [ORG-23]. So there's an out-of-the-box app here for [ORG-23].
Agent: So as you are taking these audiences of your first party data and funneling them out to the various walled gardens that be, we need to be able to see what is the engagement within these audiences without having to swivel chair from [PRODUCT-1] over to [ORG-4], [PRODUCT-1] over to [ORG-7], I want to be able to see in one pane of glass with an out-of-the-box dashboard, how are these new audiences and market and cloud advertising performing for me?
Agent: Which ones am I using, which ones are hot, which ones are not. So we can say take a look at whatever platform we are actually in [ORG-4], [ORG-7], [ORG-5], [ORG-6], what have you.
Agent: Which audiences are in use or not in use, so we can keep an eye on our entitlements and make sure that we are maximizing utilization of our tool.
Agent: How are these doing against the various campaigns and KPIs that we care about?
Agent: So we can take a look at maybe a [ORG-18] perspective, which audience that we are actually now has the highest or lowest [ORG-18], highest or lowest cost per conversion.
Agent: So that way we're optimizing where we are leveraging these audiences for the right channels and right goals for [ORG-3]. So to kind of recap, [PRODUCT-1] intelligence reports advanced here brings three key things for you guys.
Agent: It's going to bring the ability to customize your dashboards, the ability to query your data out of any data extension in Marketing Cloud without having to touch any sequel on the back end, and a suite of out-of-the-box apps that are going to give you insight into those cross-channel engagements that your fans are already having with you.
Agent: And being able to provide you insight into how the audiences from [PRODUCT-1] advertising are performing. And in [TIME-1], that's basically [PRODUCT-1] intelligence reports advanced.
EndUser: Thank you, [PERSON-9]. Question on the [ORG-7] Ads AI tool.
EndUser: Is there a recommended length or spend?
EndUser: So it's operating up. You know, full ability, like is there, you know, we have to be running 5k for like [DATE-23] for it to make, you know, recommended recommendations like.
Agent: Face off those lines. I will get back to you on that. I know that. I don't know the exact number for our threshold minimums for a to predict things within intelligence reports advanced.
Agent: I do know that just categorically, most of our [PRODUCT-6] requires a very small and number. In terms of being able to fuel meaningful outputs, what that looks like for intelligence reports advanced.
EndUser: Or I'll get you a specific on
Agent: And I'll send it over to [PERSON-10] to include in the follow up from this meeting. No,
Agent: Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome.
Agent: Awesome, thanks [PERSON-9] and [PERSON-11].
Agent: I know it was a lot, but like any, or call it any additional other questions that you have from that, we're gonna again, follow up with it so you have some of it in Slide where to review, but.
EndUser: That sound helpful based on what you guys are currently doing [DATE-2]. Honestly, it could be [PERSON-10]. I think I need to talk to [PERSON-18] as well. Because he's involved in some of the intelligence reporting that we do.
EndUser: So I think it wouldn't be helpful if you could share this Recording as well. In addition to the two order forms, that would be. really beneficial for us.
Agent: As you said with the tight timeline, I just want to make sure we get everybody involved as quickly as possible. And [PERSON-18] will be back [ORG-18].
EndUser: Online [DATE-18], so I want to give him a chance to review.
Agent: Yeah, I can definitely get those two over to you and then Recording as well [DATE-18]. Perfect.
Agent: All right, so the only other two things I wanted to touch on that we included within kind of like the aggressive value path that we're trying to put together through guys is around [PRODUCT-1] shield, which essentially just provides trust and encryption solutions to the marketing cloud, right?
Agent: So I think that's just something that's good to know. I can put some I can put some additional details in there as well.
Agent: [PERSON-1] and that should be anything you want to talk about that high level because not either you'd really action off of it's just something to keep you. Thank you . care. Yeah, for sure.
Agent: I mean, for the sake of a Recording while we're here, why not?
Agent: So I pull up something and then you guys have something to reference back to.
Agent: So for the penultimate time [DATE-2], since we've been on the clock, we've got some visuals to go through in a company, our talk track as we're thinking about marketing [PRODUCT-8].
Agent: So we think about encryption, right?
Agent: Data's our number one most valuable commodity. You guys being in [GPE-3], you understand CCPA, [ORG-26], [ORG-26], all those other multi-letter acronyms that keep legal awake at [TIME-2].
Agent: And we want to make sure that while [ORG-23] is our number one value at [ORG-8], you guys have all of the tools at your disposal to ensure that you are operating in compliance with how your company defines compliance.
Agent: So, I want to start with what you have to then frame what is additional in [PRODUCT-9] and the additional benefits therein. So in Marketing Cloud, you have something called the audit trail.
Agent: It's kind of like a breadcrumb.
Agent: Makes sense, right?
Agent: Console and Gretel. It'll hold data for you for [DATE-23] rolling. and your interface to extract data from that is using automation studio extracts.
Agent: And it really just covers some of the housekeeping stuff, right?
Agent: So changes in security, changes to user permissions, your IP addresses, the housekeeping stuff for [DATE-23], that's really all it does from an audit trail standpoint. It's included, you've got it. You also have multi-factor authentication.
Agent: We've all experienced this.
Agent: We get a ping and a notification on our phone once we try to log into [ORG-7] or bank, what happened?
Agent: You've got all of that included. And you have what's included. It's called encryption for data in transit. So as data is being brought into marketing cloud, or data is being brought out of marketing cloud, that data is encrypted.
Agent: And we also support bring your own key encryption, should your IT team say we want to use our own keys. Cool, no problem. That's what you have. Audit trail for housekeeping, [DATE-23], multi-factor authentication, and data in transit.
Agent: Now, what does Marketing Cloud field add on top of that?
Agent: Well, it includes what we call our advanced audit trail. So it extends that rolling window from [DATE-26].
Agent: And it incorporates a lot more into the audit trail to understand what's working and what's perhaps not working under the hood.
Agent: So we think about extending from just user permissioning and that type of how to have been housekeeping to be a lot more.
Agent: We're now looking at logins, changes to data extensions, changes to business unit structures, publishes of different cloud pages. There's a lot more that comes into play with the advanced audit trail as one component of [FAC-1].
Agent: The other thing that's included is what we call transparent data encryption is the nerdy word, it often goes by encryption at rest. So the data as it sits on the disk is encrypted with 239K bank level encryption.
Agent: So if it prevents anybody with physical access to the disk from being able to read your data without your permission. And again, supports BYOK, bring your own key.
Agent: This does still empower end users at the application level when you log into [PRODUCT-1] to be able to see field values because they need to see what's in there to do their segmentation.
Agent: It's just encrypting the values that sit on the disk and it requires no implementation. [ORG-18] Trail and Encryption which come within [PRODUCT-9] require no implementation.
Agent: You just sign and we turn it on the back end.
Agent: So we want to make sure that y'all were aware of this as different offerings to us, you know, sort of proactively ensuring you guys have all the knowledge and tools to operate within compliance.
Agent: However, you guys define compliance in the rather unfortunately complicated data legality landscape, we all find ourselves in [DATE-26].
EndUser: That's helpful. Thanks [PERSON-9]. It's definitely something that we have to be conned as an of obviously, but the league is pretty stringent with this stuff. I think we go through a pretty extensive [ORG-32] list
Agent: Pretty often to remove folks. So that would probably be pretty helpful. For sure.
Agent: Happy to make sure you guys are aware of it.
Agent: Nice. Awesome. Thank you, [PERSON-9]. All right. With [TIME-3] left. Are there any other questions or anything else that would be helpful for us to highlight while we are all
EndUser: Live and recording?
EndUser: I think I'm good on my end.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-6], [PERSON-4], we played during anything for me, guys.
Agent: Nothing on my end. All good.
Agent: Right. Great. Well. Um, if that is the consensus, we can draft now, I will follow up with those two order forms.
Agent: [PERSON-7], we talked about the one with the standard and credential increase and then the one with the flat increase, but then the addition of products. as well as it's Recording and then happy to get another call.
Agent: [PERSON-18] wants to kind of jump into to have it to ask any additional questions.
EndUser: Happy to schedule that. So we'll follow up with all that for you guys [DATE-18]. Perfect. Really appreciate it. And just for clarity on your schedules,
Agent: You guys are in office [DATE-23], but out the following. I am around.
Agent: So technically, technically [DATE-18] and [EVENT-1], I'm out, but really out, you know?
EndUser: It's our cue for so I'm never Okay, just wanted to make sure.
Agent: So feel free to pay me with anything.
EndUser: Thank you. Yeah.
EndUser: What about you guys?
EndUser: Are you guys closed [DATE-32] or no?
EndUser: We are technically closed after [DATE-32]. A bunch of us will still be on [DATE-23], though, obviously, with our delayed [EVENT-2] piece.
Agent: So I think some things will definitely trickle in [DATE-32], but I think most of us are going to be off. Okay. All right. So ideally we needed to kind of get everything wrapped up by end
EndUser: Of [DATE-23] to make sure like we're all kind of locked and loaded before going into the holidays. Yeah, I think it won't go past that.
Agent: And hopefully it's even sooner. But we'll get some feedback and we'll get back to you. Perfect. Okay, great. I will give you all these follow-ups for [DATE-18]. [PERSON-1], thank you as always
EndUser: And [ORG-32]. Thank you
EndUser: For your time. Really appreciate it. And we will talk you, [PERSON-9].
Agent: Soon. Thank
EndUser: Thanks, [PERSON-10].","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly express whether the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did not raise any objections or concerns during the demo and discussion. They showed interest in the product and asked questions about its features and capabilities. They also mentioned that the product could be beneficial for their needs, but they need to discuss it with their team before making a decision. Therefore, it is unclear if the customer feels that the product meets their needs based on the information provided in the transcript.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the ad suppression use case of the seller's product, as they believed it would help them be more intentional with their ad spend. They also thought it would make their process and strategy of orchestrating multi-channel experiences for fans quick to action. The customer sees the value in ensuring they are not showing ads to existing customers or season ticket holders, and the seller's product can help them achieve that efficiently.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide enough information about the customer's needs and the sales rep's understanding of them. However, there are a few instances where the sales rep could have potentially spent more time clarifying certain points or asking further questions.

For example, when discussing the customer's budget for paid digital advertising, the sales rep could have asked more specific questions to better understand the customer's spending capabilities and priorities. The customer mentions that their budget is ""kind of up for grabs"" and ""still a work in progress,"" but the sales rep does not explore this further. Additionally, when discussing the features and benefits of the sales rep's product, the sales rep could have asked the customer about their current pain points and how the product could address them.

Overall, while the sales rep does cover a lot of ground in the call, there are a few missed opportunities to delve deeper into the customer's needs and ensure that the product is a good fit for them.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are the open-ended questions asked by the sales rep:

1. ""Is there anything else that you guys wanted to kind of call out out of the top of the call?""
2. ""So I guess with that, I'm [PERSON-1], who I believe you guys have all met before. We've met a couple of times. Are there any questions or anything else that you guys would like to cover before we dive into the demo?""
3. ""So I'm curious as you think about your marketing strategies for [DATE-10], are you guys thinking about orchestrating multi-channel experiences for fans?""
4. ""I'm curious as you think about [DATE-10], what sort of [DATE-18] spend are you thinking for paid digital advertising, which would include social and search?""
5. ""And I'm just curious, how much is advertising the studio, if we were to bolt it on. So what I did for this was put together like a package deal, if you will.""

These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs, budget, and marketing strategies, which is crucial in identifying customer intent.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep mentioned that there would be a price increase due to salesforce, but did not clearly articulate the benefits that the seller's product would bring to offset this increase.
2. The sales rep mentioned that the product can help with customer expectation of unified experience across different channels, but did not provide specific examples or metrics to support this claim.
3. The sales rep mentioned that the product can help with look-alike modeling for new fan acquisition, suppression, and nurture campaigns, but did not provide specific details on how this would be done or what the expected results would be.
4. The sales rep mentioned that the product can help with stitching paid digital advertising alongside nurture campaigns, but did not provide specific examples or metrics to support this claim.
5. The sales rep mentioned that the product can help with multi-channel experiences for fans, but did not provide specific examples or metrics to support this claim.
6. The sales rep mentioned that the product can help with orchestrating multi-channel experiences for fans, but did not provide specific examples or metrics to support this claim.
7. The sales rep mentioned that the product can help with maximizing message in-patch with insights analytics customized to your business needs, but did not provide specific examples or metrics to support this claim.
8. The sales rep mentioned that the product can help with trust and encryption solutions, but did not provide specific examples or metrics to support this claim.

In general, the sales rep could have done a better job of providing specific examples and metrics to support the value proposition of the seller's product. They could have also done a better job of addressing the customer's specific needs and concerns, such as budget constraints and limited resources.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. The sales rep asked about the customer's thoughts on orchestrating multi-channel experiences for fans, and the customer seemed more engaged as they discussed their current marketing strategies and the potential for a multi-channel approach.
2. The sales rep asked about the customer's budget for paid digital advertising, which led to a discussion about the customer's budgeting process and potential spend for the upcoming year. The customer seemed engaged as they provided more information about their budgeting process and constraints.
3. The sales rep asked about the customer's interest in the Marketing Cloud Shield product, which provides trust and encryption solutions. The customer seemed engaged as they discussed the importance of data security and compliance in their industry.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: It is unclear from the transcript if the right decision maker was on the call to move the deal forward. The customer mentioned the need to circle up with the rest of the team to decide on moving forward with the advertising studio and other pieces. The agreed-upon next steps include the seller sending the customer two order forms, one with the package and one without, as well as a recording of the call. The seller also mentioned following up with specific information on the AI tool's threshold minimums. The customer requested to involve another person ([PERSON-18]) in the discussion, who will be back online on a certain date. The seller offered to schedule another call for further discussion.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer did not explicitly express their sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call. However, they did mention that they needed to circle up with their team to decide if they wanted to move forward with the advertising studio and the other pieces of the package. They also requested order forms and a recording of the call, which indicates that they are interested in the deal and want to review the information before making a decision. Overall, the customer sentiment seems cautiously optimistic but not fully committed yet."
video_14198_167_6qr3y000000sZWhAAM,"Agent: That voice. There we go. For [DATE-1]'s, the purpose of [DATE-1]'s call, I enlisted [PERSON-1] and it looks like we've got both [PERSON-2]'s on from the solution engineering side to specifically [PERSON-3].
Agent: As you said, kind of go through [PERSON-4]'s take on the nested arrays question, but longer term here. Yeah, it would be really, obviously, we need to know We have that.
EndUser: And I'll send it to you right the way after. Yeah, perfect.
Agent: I'm right now.
EndUser: And we have been also internally pushing the team.
EndUser: And it's a little bit of work for the team internally, because they are so used to talking about their specific use case, you're asking them to take a step back and say, hey, this is what I want to do instead of getting into the weeds of saying, I will be using this to the reason.
EndUser: I'm like, can you just sell what you are trying to do?
EndUser: So then probably the team can answer that better. And that's what we have right now. And I'll send that to you. OK, that's
Agent: Great.
Agent: And then so for the purpose of [DATE-1]'s call, did you want [PERSON-4], because I know there was a question on nested arrays in that quip document that [PERSON-4] had answered in part, do you want him to go over that?
EndUser: But I think it'll also be helpful because [PERSON-5] and I had a very good chat [DATE-2] about, far the demos, when are we going to be able to get to the, like, you know, [PERSON-5] expressed some concern in terms of timelines and having to make sure that the right folks are.
EndUser: There for us, et cetera So I think that'll also be helpful for us to know I think those are the two main things which I have of like hey, when can we do the demos to ge t to the little bit of details And if we share, like, if you have alread y worked on [EVENT-1] itself, I would love to probably answer that question and like, go through that with you guy s if you have that answer That's all .
Agent: Yeah, I think for [DATE-1]'s call, it was just like you wanted [PERSON-4]'s POV on how we would do that with [ORG-1] frankly that because the last couple of use cases that we've seen have skewed towards maybe eat more beat more easily being done in Marketing Cloud engagement when historically the RFP questions that were waited more heavily [DATE-3] were all very clearly [ORG-1] so.
EndUser: And also
Agent: I think what [PERSON-6] and
Agent: I talked about [DATE-2] is exactly that is let's look at the requirements What are they what does the team want to do and then let's make that determination of hey?
Agent: We absolutely can go out of the box custom future state This solution go out of the box custom future state and I think we can present the full picture. We can accomplish all of what we've seen.
Agent: The question we're trying to solve as a team is what tool is the right one for the team at that time.
Agent: And is it just one or is it potentially more than one that we'd use?
Agent: And then I think to answer the question to [PERSON-3], we're working with [PERSON-7] and the team right now to figure out the timing that you and I discussed. How deep technical or the demo.
Agent: Could we do in a short period of time versus what can we deliver so that we hit the mark for the team in the timeframe?
EndUser: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I think
EndUser: Yeah, I think we just need to like get to a place of like, you know, and I know [PERSON-5] is saying this is future state.
EndUser: So I will be more blunt about it and say that is it like just MC or is it MC a plus a [ORG-2] solves the problem. I think that's what he's saying is the third
Agent: Option and we just need to nail it, I think clearly. Yeah, yeah, maybe it's for office. It's out of the box custom future never.
EndUser: State never. Right. Yeah,
Agent: Never. Never I doubt will happen, but yeah. No, I know. Okay.
Agent: So for [DATE-1]'s call on the nested array, question specifically, did you want, [PERSON-3], I just want to be clear on what we want to ask [PERSON-4] kind of specifically [DATE-1]
EndUser: Because we didn't have any. I can just talk about the business problem instead of keep saying nested arrays, [PERSON-4].
EndUser: So basically, let me just, and I have outlined this in the dark, but if it was not clear, I can talk through that. So one of the examples, one of the problems which we are trying to.
EndUser: Solve is once a merchant becomes an existing merchant for us. So they sign up and they ar e a part of the existing merchant right now.
EndUser: We send out, we have something called an interna l Optimization engine, basically what that is.
EndUser: This is think of this as our version of [PERSON-8] internally, which basically tells my merchants that, you know, hey, the next set of actions you need to take are one, two, three for you to make more money as a restaurant partner, you know, or to get more growth as a restaurant partner, etc.
EndUser: So these actions are obviously different for different merchants based on what stage they are in, like, you know, what products they've already output all the sales refreshed.
EndUser: Adopted from [ORG-3], like, you know, various things that we call it [PERSON-9], virtual <inaudible> department , So there are various things. So these recommendations are very like specific to tha t specific store.
EndUser: So we send out an email to these merchants [DATE-4], which I' m not sure about the frequency, but we send out an email, which basically lists out the recommendations , are personalized recommendations for these merchants, right?
EndUser: So y ou Currently, this is getting pulled from the product. So internally in product for every store ID, store ID is the unique identifier here.
EndUser: For every store ID, there is like, these are the three actions you need to take, which could be adopt this product or update your menu item or whatever that could be.
EndUser: So the three actions that will be there, it'll be connected to every store ID inside the product portal.
EndUser: And from product portal, currently it's getting pulled into Currently it's getting pulled into snowflake And from snowflake, it's getting pulled into iterable And then they send out the email [PERSON-10], do you want to add any more there I think .
EndUser: Anymore there in terms of i know [PERSON-9] has actually identified that as one use case in the doc which he shared [DATE-2] so please add if i'm missing out anything and we send out the email and then once they take one action out of it the next email that will go to them obviously will have another three personal items recommendations which they need to take and so on and so forth so this is where as a clinical feasibility, the team currently in ETRBL is using nested arrays to do this is what they mentioned.
EndUser: Like if we have to do something like this in
Agent: Padot, you know, we were trying
EndUser: To understand how we would do this. Yeah. [PERSON-3], can you just like confirm what the last thing I said there, the complexity is around pulling information from multiple
EndUser: Stores into one email.
EndUser: Is that was
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: Oh no, that a good idea. Go ahead, [PERSON-10]. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is true. That's what it is doing. It's like looping through and pulling in for each store, the recommendation basically, and into one email.
EndUser: So instead of sending five emails about each store, it's sending one email with information about five stores. That's how I understood
Agent: It.
EndUser: Okay. Um,
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, I'll stop. Yeah, sorry.
EndUser: [PERSON-10], do you have to go out there or?
EndUser: Yeah, and I think so both of what you're saying is true and it may not be in the same email.
EndUser: So yes, what [PERSON-9] saying absolutely happens and what [PERSON-3] saying to also happens where it's combing through a list of suggestions for [PERSON-9] and then populating that into emails that could go to thousands of merchants.
EndUser: So [PERSON-9] saying is also true. That also happens. where a merchant may have multiple stores and the way that the nested objects currently work. If you have one store, it sees that and it gives you one suggestion.
EndUser: If you have five stores, you may get five different things. So yes, both of those are happening, not necessarily in the same email, although they might be, yes, both are true.
Agent: Correct.
Agent: That's good to know. So there's an area where there's a company that has one that in stores and you want to be able to report all of those together. And then there might be multiple recommendations per store.
Agent: So that's another another level of a right in a sense. So it might be one in stores in recommendations.
EndUser: And for each store, it might be one Is that right?
Agent: I think, yeah, that's fair to say. Yeah. Okay.
Agent: Um, one question I do have, um, so did you say that the recommendation is coming from snowflake?
EndUser: Or like, what, what decides what information should be in that email?
EndUser: So sorry, uh, the recommendation is actually inside the product portal. So it is inside portal, which the merchants
EndUser: My, uh, the merchant have access to. And that's what decides. Well, you know, uh, it's a mission learning algorithm. Sorry, go ahead.
EndUser: Yeah, we do have the data outside of the portal, though it's not like, because we use it for sales too, for example, like we run queries and put it in, we use
Agent: Sigma,
EndUser: And we display to them so we do have the data and snowflake yes. And sharing my screen. So this is how the email itself looks in it, it reveals. So it says these are your top recommended actions.
EndUser: And then there are the cards. So these are the cards which are personalized that are getting pulled by merchant.
EndUser: So whatever, if I am [PERSON-17] bakery, I will have three cards which will tell me what my actions that I need to take are. This is [PERSON-10]'s coffee shop will have a different one. That's getting pulled for [PERSON-10].
Agent: Okay.
Agent: So I guess at the top level, so wanted to mention kind of where we do support this type of functionality and where we don't, and then do want to jump into, you know, some ideas or discussing, you know, how we might address this scenario.
Agent: And I believe that pattern can apply to other areas as well.
Agent: And then, you know, [PERSON-2]'s please jump in because I think you have come across some experiences as well where, you know, techniques that customers use and just want to provide everything we can. So.
Agent: So account engagement, the closest feature that I would say is related to nested arrays is what we call custom objects, right?
Agent: And so you can have one in custom objects related to an object related to an account or to an individual.
Agent: The challenge though is that is not available for personalization, meaning it's not something that you can tag and reference in an email, but you are able to tag and reference in segmentation and automation roles in order to make decisions determine the path.
Agent: So that's where we have the gap. Where customers tend to come or where customers tend to essentially kind of use this to mimic the functionality.
Agent: And I think the example you gave is kind of a good one two walk through, is really providing that information where possible, already just consolidated for the need.
Agent: And so this example, you know, kind of what I would ask is,
Agent: Is there a way that this information could be pushed or pulled before the email send?
Agent: So then just think of it like you have an HTML Content block. And then that's what you're inserting in that contains all that information already kind of stylized to what's needed is kind of one way.
Agent: It could be passed as a CSV which [PERSON-2] I believe there's ways two format that also an HTML.
Agent: And then other customers when they do have those records already passed, you know, they also use some formula fields and other things in order to collapse that to a single. custom field.
Agent: And I think that's really kind of the generic pattern we have at hand her e is can this multi-information be pushed into a single field?
Agent: In our fields, for the most part you can pass HTML, you can pass rich text formatting, so it can be stored in a way that has multi line s and multi-information.
Agent: The other, and so that's kind of the first thing that popped in my head i s Hey, is there a way where you could call that recommendation engine and insert the recommendatio ns and then have that recommendation field as the input to the, um, input into the email?
Agent: So th en for the, you know, based on kind of that example, you should be, it would just be, you know, the [ORG-4] ta g, store recommendations, right?
Agent: And then it would insert under ther e. The other thing that we also do support, but again, it's kind of an all or none, is multi-submit fields.
Agent: So that's another way you can kind of store multiple lines of information and then be able to embed that in the email.
Agent: So that's another way as like if those recommendations are more static or, or, you know, get generated at a certain time, you could set those to, you know, here's the recommendations have one by line and then embed it that way.
Agent: But that's kind of really the, the, the length of kind of tools and text and things we have. And it's really tried to collapse that array. into its final form.
Agent: So then it's a custom field that you're inserting into the email.
Agent: I wanna pause and just ask the [PERSON-17], like anything to add there, or anything that comes to mind that that could apply to kind of help replicate this.
Agent: Yeah, [PERSON-2], [PERSON-17], did you have anything to add to, uh, yeah, you missed the straight away. Of course, [PERSON-4] had mentioned [DATE-5] is Yeah, before we.
Agent: Yeah, that checks for some things I was thinking about like, obviously like.
Agent: In the past when I used to talk to customers about, well, how can we get that custom object info available?
Agent: Remember that we can first slice with anything from contact, lead, account, et cetera. So what I've talked about in the past is, well, it used to be process builder.
Agent: Now I would use Flow because that's kind of the process automation of choice and core. Use the Flow capability in [PRODUCT-1] to take records as they get updated or created in those custom objects.
Agent: And write them to a, you know, like maybe like set aside three two five fields on the contact record for recommendation one recommendation two, recommendation three, and then as those, if those are in the custom object, we can use flow to kind of push those through that process into those fields And now we can take that personalization The thing that [PERSON-4] mentioned, what that was interesting about the recommend date, like call it to the recommendation engine which I think is how I interpret it, [PERSON-4], tell me about this Bu t We have a solution that another solution in our in o ur Marketing portfolio called personalization.
Agent: And I'm n ot trying to upsell you want to us not want to hear for it 's more that the way that works is actually is a ve ry similar concept where we call out to we use HTML Code to basically call out to that personalization engine.
Agent: And it returns back, you know, rich text or an image or something on those lines based up on What is determined and that's done just through an HTML call and but it then it gets resolved over the personalization inside and it actually serves the bit of Content so that's something that could work if the your personalization engine is capable of rendering that stuff.
Agent: Obviously, that would that would.
Agent: Yeah, sorry I'll stop there. In that. What [PERSON-2] is just mentioning on the Marketing Cloud personalization piece that's an add on.
Agent: Basically, what you do is you just have a the HTML block that's within the email that you built within an [ORG-5] and then.
Agent: The Marketing Cloud personalization engine is doing the calls and coming up with those recommendations kind of packing packaging those nicely. And then that's going to show up through the email that's sent through account engagement.
Agent: So that's how they're working together to be able to serve that up.
Agent: So I want to add that context. I appreciate that. And I wasn't even thinking down that path, but that makes sense. And. And obviously, as mentioned, you know, marking cloud engagement also has very similar capabilities.
Agent: So it could be an optional add-on as well to more robustly solve it. But yeah, as kind of mentioned in account engagement, the typical in-solution option is collapsing it to the fields on the prospect.
Agent: And flows a great way to do that. I think there is an option.
Agent: As well, similar to be able to make the call out What I was thinking there was actually external actions So before you do the send, you actually call out and store th e suggestions in the custom field, then embed them in the email and then send them out So it kind of gives you a similar way.
Agent: But again, it's tha t it's what can you store in one or a few fields versus having that related object aspect of it. Having it be able to tag to the related object, if that makes sense.
Agent: Now I want to pause and just hear from [ORG-3]. That's the high level things and just see if that's That's in the ballpark of an area y'all want to go.
EndUser: And how y'all get your thoughts on how that works. I think it's helpful. I do have one But I just have asked one question and pass it on to [PERSON-9] and [PERSON-10].
Agent: Question. And I don't want to get too into the weeds.
EndUser: As I was hearing you say, and [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-2], exactly, like I actually ping the [PERSON-17] and ask, I think adding personalization might solve most of our problems.
EndUser: Am I right?
EndUser: Was there a question?
EndUser: Was my question to her?
EndUser: And that was just based off of my excellent skills of [ORG-6] search of like trying in and see that, you know, there were various places where personalization talked about desertion engine outside and I'm like, ah, this is what we're trying to do.
Agent: To put those problems So.
EndUser: So, but yeah, that's because I'm not used personalization as a product before so I do not know the product very well But anyways, [PERSON-4], I have a question and I don't want to get too into the weeds .
EndUser: Is it in your example of how you're solving this problem?
EndUser: And I don't know the flow functionality too well. So I'm going to probably dumb it down for me to say that.
EndUser: So let's say we have three custom fields in sales force, right, in the [PRODUCT-1], which are these three recommendations. And I'm just taking three as a number right now.
EndUser: But once these recommendations, and we are, of course, pulling those three fields to the prospect record and putting that in the email. But these fields, like I'm managing, gets updated.
EndUser: So, he's never thought process there that this will get overwritten ove r period of time of like first three recommendations will be there.
EndUser: And then if it is the secon d to the fourth two, three and four, then the first one will get overwritten as a recommendation Am I thinking about this correctly or am I off-beat here?
Agent: Like completely off-base here . I think that would come into Implementation details. So if you're copying over the records, right, and that's kind of coming in and it's just the latest three recommendations that you always want to pull.
Agent: Then that would be something you'd kind of implement and flow. And it would kind of refresh on a periodic basis. Is one way you could approach that. You could even approach it on a custom triggered event.
Agent: You know, when a new record comes in for that custom object type, go update these suggestions.
Agent: Another way via flow or as I mentioned external actions that you could do it is have the call out happen before lik e like external actions would be probably easier to control, but have the call out occur before the email send.
Agent: So then you don't have to create this constant update pipe.
Agent: Because I think one problem you're gonna have is the recommendation engine is a point in time recommendation, right?
Agent: And so, you know, [TIME-1] later it could be different. So, you know, the best, like, the more timely you can make that I think the better you're off you would be.
Agent: So, I actually would recommend something like the external action, just so you're calling the actual recommendation service to get what it is at that time and then just throw that into, and then with the external action you could even include the formatting aspect of it and then throw it into a field.
Agent: So, it's just basically
EndUser: Like a Content block that you had [DATE-1]. email . God, thank you. I will [PERSON-21]. I know we are still talking hypothetical, so it'll be very difficult to get to specific questions.
EndUser: But yeah, please read free to ask any questions you have.
EndUser: Quick one for me. Custom objects
Agent: And custom fields. Are there limitations on that like number that we can use or any other limitations to know that There are limitations on custom objects.
Agent: I'm blanking on it, [PERSON-2], if you all remember. Custom fields, there is not really. Well, out of the box, I believe with the account engagement, you have access to five custom objects, but you can always add those on.
Agent: I like. and that on and relatively low costs, depending on how many of that you would need. I haven't, I can't pull like a maximum off the top of my head.
Agent: I just know a lot of our customers sink with a lot more custom objects than five. But I can, I can try to look that
Agent: Up really quickly.
Agent: I remember [DATE-6] sometimes.
Agent: We sometimes met with engineering like we started getting like usually over 10 and then we also had to look like the number of records in each custom object as well because there comes a point where like over 840,000 records and a custom object become becomes problematic and [PERSON-4] you're closer to the engineering stuff and I am now so I don't know if that number has changed recently but I'm kind of going by old knowledge here.
Agent: But could be higher but it's a it's sort of like there's multiple factors in that equation that will determine how many you can have.
Agent: So the number
Agent: There we go.
EndUser: And the use of the custom object is to is for you to be able to insert those like the information that you need.
Agent: Um, really the the custom objects currently are to support, um, segmentation and path routing for automations. Um, so it is, it is in effect. Like, it is very similar to the array that you were describing.
Agent: It's just that there isn't the personalization aspect on that to then be able to call and reference a specific instance specific field to include in the email.
Agent: So that's why I mentioned, you know, flow or even automation rules could be an option because you could detect that . event and potentially summarize that way.
Agent: I like the idea of flow a little bit better just because just because I think it works closer to the custom objects. So you'd have a little bit more control how you'd process through those.
Agent: But yeah, so that's really kind of the key thing is the fact that you essentially need to take kind of that array and collapse it into a single field or pull from the source and collapse into a single word to collapse into a set number of fields.
EndUser: And you're talking about like flow that we use in like Sales Cloud and things like that too. It's
Agent: The same. functionality. Yeah, it would
EndUser: Be the same functionality.
Agent: So flow is actually on the back end. Time to like the account engagement, external actions capability, where you can trigger sales force flow to call it to an external tool and trigger an action, things like that.
Agent: So the two are already. very coupled and flows also getting kind of a, or has gotten a facelift so to speak. Okay.
Agent: It's going to be simpler to use those historically, like more of a different developer type of tool, but as now, Kind of reshaped to be able to be used, you know, using the power by like your more general sales force types of users to be able to, you know, use all that potential because flow
EndUser: Is extremely powerful for these types. Remind me then like what type of permissions you have, you need to have like on the [ORG-7] instance
Agent: For that.
Agent: I'm not [PERCENT-1] sure, wondering if you had to have admin.
Agent: But where's it managed?
EndUser: I'm
Agent: No, it's there's
EndUser: Actually
Agent: A specific permission. Yeah, and then recently they've added a lot of like some permissions so that within flow itself, there's basically a permission now for like everything that you can do or see.
Agent: So number one, it can simplify something for somebody who's not like a flow probe. And really only see the things that they would really need for their type of role. So they're not accidentally doing things they shouldn't do.
EndUser: So that's just
Agent: One thing worth noting as well. Okay. Yeah, I was just curious. And then the other thing I did want to bring up as well. Just is depending on. you know, the urgency on your side.
Agent: When you need this capability, I did want to mention safe harbor. We are working on a functionality that you will have access to.
Agent: It's just too early to tell when we'll be able to get it into your hands at this time. But we are working on a cross-object functionality very similar to what you were referencing. So that is coming.
Agent: It's just depending on when your need is, which option, I guess,
EndUser: If it's now, And we probably want to look at the existing solutions Like everything we're doing in the post-ales <inaudible> e is around these [ORG-8] recommendations right now So yeah, it's like ,
Agent: It's everything.
Agent: Yeah, so we have to do it now. I understand. Let's get kind of extended. It's the thing that, sorry, I had to leave for a second, someone's at the door.
Agent: I heard post sales, and this may be me not being familiar with the account.
Agent: When, back in [DATE-7] when I talked to some customers, there was, and I know if we've been talking about Marketing cut engagement, sometimes here and there, one thing that we talked about was there was a line, right?
Agent: So acquiring the customers would be sometimes, would be like where Marketing cut of [ORG-9] comes into play. And then once we hit that point where we're doing the post sales recommendations.
Agent: And communication, sometimes that gets handed of f to market cut engagement It was some customers that talked about thi s because now you've got the ability to d o a little bit more of that heavier [ORG-10] capability that it offers Like obviously the whole customer being abl e to use custom objects in personalized email s can do that, SMS .
Agent: Market cog age can do that push notifications working time to do that right so everything that gets the person signed sealed and delivered is handled by [ORG-5] and then we try to kind of transfer it over to engagement to kind of do the ongoing care and maintenance and upsell of those folks and they may sometimes it even comes back to be in you know sign up from your service Maybe the kind of engagement comes back again.
Agent: So that's if we do start to consider Adding the Marketing kind of account engagement, some point to do some of this stuff. Instead, keep in mind the one thing I recommend is make sure there's a hard and fast
Agent: Line so that we don't blend things too much between the two of them. Yeah, and [PERSON-21] that's consistent with what we were talking about as well.
Agent: This is kind of life cycle, right?
Agent: There's acquisition and now there's this kind of post upsell, crosssell adoption. And then the loop comes back and the question becomes person of the interest [DATE-1]. I think we can do some of the things we're talking about.
Agent: Is there a different solution that could be. more out of the box. Some words we were using
EndUser: For some of those requirements and we can get to the bottom of that or the course.
EndUser: Do you guys have a map then?
EndUser: I mean, so it's been [DATE-8]. I've been at [ORG-3] now [DATE-9] and it's mostly focused on the sales side. So you guys are using words I didn't use at [ORG-9] when we had Marketing clubs.
EndUser: So I'm like, what is the difference map of your marketing.
Agent: Anyway?
Agent: If you have like a like ecosystem.
EndUser: Could you send that over so I can just re-acclimate myself?
EndUser: Because if when I [ORG-6] it, it
Agent: Doesn't put the picture together for me.
Agent: I just, I need to see ho w that's all. Yeah We're all in there Yeah One translation for you Count Engagement was known as Pardot and so that's where them .
Agent: [PERSON-17] engagement is is the old name.
Agent: Marketing and journeys Exactly.
Agent: The old exact target [PERSON-9]. Oh, okay. Okay.
EndUser: It was an exact target. So, so I think in the question was like, yes. The way I've used that mostly is we created data extensions and then we would write the [ORG-9] script to generate the emails.
Agent: So that's what you're talking about. You got it. Those are the two products. Our Marketing team likes to change
EndUser: Things up every year on the names so we confuse everybody, including ourselves. I mean, that's how [ORG-9] is doing it right now.
EndUser: Part out for like top of the funnel for like mostly for their restaurant like their open table competitor product and then all of the rest of that is like post sales and it's all going through Marketing club, but it's just like It's not a marketer friendly unless you guys have made some changes like the dragon drug like having to like train people on And writing data, you know, building data extensions and writing am script to do emails is like not.
Agent: It's not great for marketers, you know, you have to have a very like technical savvy marketer.
Agent: I think been some changes to that to make that easier, kind of low code, maybe not totally, but no code to low code, right?
EndUser: There's
Agent: But there's probably still going to be some instances where, to your point, some am scripts got to be written usually
EndUser: During implementation, hopefully, and then people can just take that and just dump those on the canvas from there. So there's definitely been some improvements for the marketer. As long as you guys, you have better like clone capabilities too.
Agent: I think was one of the other problems we had there was like, cloning and things wasn't easy. They had to rewrite everything. Okay. Yeah, no, it's definitely, that was a little bit of a pain point.
Agent: So those have been worked on for sure. So, but that's, we can kind of lay out the ecosystem. Yeah, that's the difference right there. So the capabilities are all here.
Agent: I think the question we're trying to answer the most effectively to create a better experience for all the marketers that would use the store dashes.
Agent: What, what is the right thing?
Agent: What is the most out-of-the-box solution?
Agent: And then some of what we talked about [DATE-1] is more, okay, you can connect these things in this one work with one solution. Okay, cool, we want to do that.
Agent: Where do we reach the breakpoint?
Agent: And if we reach a breakpoint, we can say the [ORG-17] is this or maybe it's not the backup, the alternative solution for this portion of the life cycle equals exact target, right?
EndUser: And we're okay with that because it's all now one platform inside a sales force. And I think that's the final piece.
EndUser: Oh yeah, that's the other question I would like look like is that mean like our post sales team would b e and just theoretically saying like you know a Marketing Cloud and then to ask.
Agent: Have is like what yeah what does that
Agent: Th e All the rest of like top of the funnel acquisition would be working in part. It could be and we have a lot of customers that are doing that now.
Agent: I think a couple of reference to here and I could name more that we're probably not supposed to say, but yeah, it just depends on and oftentimes there's different team.
Agent: There's a growth team or [PRODUCT-1] team or retention team and they may be needing different requirements. So we see that across some of the accounts that were mentioned, we see it over. We see it at meta.
Agent: We see it at a bunch of different places where that's happening.
EndUser: So, again, how ideal is it is the question based on who's using what they're trying to do.
EndUser: Okay, so what is the next step then as far as understanding?
EndUser: I think one of the things [PERSON-3] I'm thinking is I would like to probably run this by their cash as well. I want him to hear that flow example.
EndUser: He obviously knows flows in and out. I would like him to kind of hear that too. [PERSON-3].
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, I think you know, if we have a person who has done this before to kind of wet this a little bit more.
EndUser: It'll be helpful.
EndUser: Like, And like [PERSON-9] mentioned, for me, it's challenging because my world has been completely to be and everything which I wanted to do. I've done in Pardot before in my life.
EndUser: And it's not been a use case, which I had to struggle off like, will it work in Pardot?
EndUser: Because my use cases have been more Enterprise mid market didn't really have a match andog [GPE-1] have come.
Agent: Sales and it
EndUser: And like what I have at [ORG-3] [DATE-1] . I think we should do it with [PERSON-19] . I think like I said, [PERSON-9], we should send this function .
EndUser: That we have like a decent requirement stuf f from the retention team in a much clearer manner , [GPE-2] has more like business requirement s or sauce rather than getting too into the weave of use cases , should share that with [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-28] and [PERSON-22] y and ask them to do that mapping of.. out of the bus product, like with customization product or like, you [PERSON-28], [ORG-17] like we talked about personalization [DATE-1] or [ORG-17] engagement [PERSON-29]: What that is.
EndUser: And then like, I think a line on our next step so that we have a clear understanding, [PERSON-9] of like, do we have to go ask for a little bit mo re money from procurement and finance for this?
EndUser: Like, you know, are we okay with lik e, you know, we are taking off seven out of the 10 box and we are okay with it f or no w. and we don't worry about it, [PERSON-30], so that we can internally
Agent: Align on what our next steps a re, I thi nk.
Agent: That sounds good. I'll send over the Recording so you can take that along so he can take a look at the recommendations from [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-2] and.
Agent: How we would do it and I think [PERSON-5] and I will work with [PERSON-7] [DATE-1] to come up with the time for as soon as possible. I know [PERSON-3] you're under the gun.
EndUser: The timelines a demo with the use cases and you'll send me the kind of prioritization scale.
Agent: On
EndUser: Yeah, I will. And I just want to say like thank you guys for working with us on this.
EndUser: I know there is like a lot of back and forth, but I feel like currently the conversations are moving in the right direction and we are making progress and I think we exactly need to map out this thing so that we know what our next step is which is a very tangible next step of if we need to buy something more we need to buy that so that
Agent: We can move forward so let's just have those conversations I think in [DATE-10] in [DATE-9] and then we can go from there. Yes thank you [PERSON-28]. Yeah And look forward to seeing those requirements.
Agent: I was just lacking with [PERSON-22] a little bit on just, you know, the timing. Maha of trying to put together and his.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are the questions:

1. ""So let's say we have three custom fields in Salesforce, right, in the [PRODUCT-1], which are these three recommendations. And I'm just taking three as a number right now. But once these recommendations, and we are, of course, pulling those three fields to the prospect record and putting that in the email. These fields, like I'm managing, gets updated. So, there's a thought process there that this will get overwritten over period of time of like first three recommendations will be there. And then if it is the second to the fourth two, three and four, then the first one will get overwritten as a recommendation. Am I thinking about this correctly or am I off-base here?""

2. ""Do you guys have a map then? I mean, so it's been [DATE-8]. I've been at [ORG-3] now [DATE-9] and it's mostly focused on the sales side. So you guys are using words I didn't use at [ORG-9] when we had Marketing clubs. So I'm like, what is the difference map of your marketing. Anyway? If you have like a like ecosystem.""

3. ""What, what is the right thing? What is the most out-of-the-box solution? And then some of what we talked about [DATE-1] is more, okay, you can connect these things in this one work with one solution. Okay, cool, we want to do that. Where do we reach the breakpoint? And if we reach a breakpoint, we can say the [ORG-17] is this or maybe it's not the backup, the alternative solution for this portion of the life cycle equals exact target, right?""

These questions help the sales rep understand the customer's needs, requirements, and constraints better, which is crucial for identifying customer intent and closing the deal.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs in the following areas:

1. The customer's use case for nested arrays: The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the specific business problem the customer is trying to solve with nested arrays. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more tailored solution.
2. The customer's experience with personalization: The sales rep could have asked the customer about their past experiences with personalization to better understand their needs and expectations.
3. The customer's team and their roles: The sales rep could have asked about the customer's team and their roles to better understand who would be using the product and what their specific needs and requirements are.
4. The customer's timeline and urgency: The sales rep could have asked about the customer's timeline and urgency to ensure that the proposed solution meets their needs in a timely manner.
5. The customer's budget: The sales rep could have asked about the customer's budget to ensure that the proposed solution is feasible and to avoid wasting time on solutions that are outside of the customer's price range.

Overall, the sales rep could have benefited from asking more open-ended questions to better understand the customer's needs and expectations. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more tailored solution and avoid wasting time on solutions that do not meet the customer's needs.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly state that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did express that the conversation was moving in the right direction and that progress was being made. They also mentioned the need to map out their next steps, which may include purchasing additional features or products. Overall, while the customer seems open to the seller's product, they have not yet determined if it fully meets their needs.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide enough information to determine if the correct decision maker was on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no clear agreed-upon next steps mentioned in the transcript. The seller and customer discuss various options and ideas, but no concrete next steps are decided upon.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1.

Here are some examples:

1. When discussing the limitations of custom objects, the sales rep mentioned that there are only five custom objects available out-of-the-box, but that more can be added for a relatively low cost. Instead of focusing on the cost, the sales rep could have emphasized the flexibility and scalability of the product, highlighting how it can be customized to meet the specific needs of the customer.
2. When discussing the use of custom objects for segmentation and path routing, the sales rep mentioned that there isn't a personalization aspect to call out specific instances or fields to include in the email. Instead of focusing on the limitations, the sales rep could have emphasized the power and control that flows provide, enabling customers to automate complex processes and create personalized experiences for their end-users.
3. When discussing the possibility of using Marketing Cloud engagement for post-sales recommendations and communication, the sales rep mentioned that it may be more out-of-the-box.

4. When discussing the use of Marketing Cloud and Pardot for top-of-the-funnel and post-sales communication, respectively, the sales rep mentioned that there are different teams with different requirements.

Agent: We'll give [PERSON-1] a second. As everyone doing. Well,
EndUser: We're
EndUser: Just being involved.
Agent: Where is he at all then from?
EndUser: As I'm [GPE-1], which is always cold. Yes, there.
Agent: You should
EndUser: Be right I'm in the guest already. Oh, not bad.
Agent: I'm [GPE-2], [PERSON-2], give it away, always cold, so it's really not the name for us.
EndUser: Which is also
EndUser: I'll just chase [PERSON-1], you know, just to do this joining.
EndUser: [PERSON-1] necessary withoutTim?
Agent: Perfect. Well, we can start off with them introductions that we like that there's a lot of new phases here. So I don't actually think I've met any of you guys.
Agent: I've met [PERSON-3], I have spoken to [PERSON-1] a few times, but I'm the account strategist, a line to [ORG-1], S cover in the [GPE-3]. So I've been in [ORG-2] [DATE-1] now.
Agent: And really what my role is, is to kind of make sure that you're getting out the most out of your [ORG-2] investment. So, you know, keeping you up to date with new solutions, innovations, events.
Agent: Everything that I kind of think holds relevance and really making sure that th e G4S Salesforce relationship runs as smoothly as a cap . that's what I do.
Agent: And [PERSON-4], do you want to go next?
Agent: Yeah, sure. Nice to meet you guys.
Agent: How's everybody doing?
Agent: You can guess some of the [PERSON-5] yank on this call, I guess. So happy to be here. I'm based in [GPE-4], which is the suburbs of [GPE-5].
Agent: And we got about a half a foot of snow [TIME-1]. So my kids are off school. So you might hear some commotion in the background, but they're very, they're very pleased about that.
Agent: So, [PERSON-6] and I share duties with with allergy for us. Obviously, folks are a big company and a big customer of sales force.
Agent: So, with the allied relationship based out of the [GPE-6], you know, headquarters in [GPE-7], but also a lot of sites on [LOC-1].
Agent: And that's where I come in and what [PERSON-6] and I work together to cover the account from a global perspective.
Agent: We've been over to see your folks in [GPE-8] a few times, the IT team and sales ops that kind of handle the sales force operations there.
Agent: So it's nice to meet you all and looking forward to a good chat [DATE-2].
EndUser: Great, [PERSON-7], do you want to go first from our end?
EndUser: Yeah, sure. So, I'm predominantly an area manager for our [ORG-3] contracts, that's patient transport services, but just take it on a role within strategy and development.
EndUser: So [ORG-2] is completely new to me, but something I definitely need to start getting more involved with and to start building our pipeline.
EndUser: Okay next, [PERSON-8], business development director for the G4S care and rehabilitation services business. So I look after all of the bidding and rebidding opportunities on [ORG-2] for all of the prison secure training centres.
EndUser: And community contracts and everyone else. So that's not a long-term solution. That's something that we're looking to divide up. But yeah, essentially I run the bids for business.
EndUser: Hi everyone.
Agent: It sounds like we're,
EndUser: There's lots of fog that we're trying to get work our way through. But I think that is the purpose of this call.
EndUser: Clearly, we don't want to keep going to [PERSON-9], to keep adding bids that come out of nowhere. And we need to ensure that we've got the right people in place that can.
EndUser: Keep Salesforce up to date and in the right way because I understand that if we get [ORG-2] wrong it can have all sorts of ramifications on how the pipeline looks and might then cause [PERSON-10] some pain.
EndUser: Hopefully the right people are on the call to make sure that we can keep it or make it work for us.
Agent: Brilliant. Just to think you missed it, [PERSON-6] actually tested positive for COVID [TIME-2], so she won't be joining, but [PERSON-4] and I will be able to look after things.
EndUser: Oh, brilliant. My sincere apologies for being late. I had to want to add a customer complaint to manage. I'll put that to bed and now I'm fully focused.
EndUser: Okay, we're just doing intros. So if you introduce yourself as well, just for anyone who doesn't know,
EndUser: Sure, so I'm the director of strategy and development for the patient transport business.
EndUser: What does that mean?
EndUser: So I've got a dual focus, one on how we grow and two is how we internally develop.
EndUser: They go hand in hand because clearly in order to grow we need to be the best at what we do to my role tries to bridge that gap.
EndUser: And then [PERSON-13].
EndUser: Hi [PERSON-13] commercial manager recently came across the [ORG-3] support so fairly new to all of this so this will be, as I said, new to me and welcome.
Agent: Sounds good.
Agent: [PERSON-13], yes, I think when we last spoke, [PERSON-1], you're kind of focused on developing the existing [ORG-4] business to kind of best thing class and building pipeline and kind of a big focus on winning a new business.
Agent: Presumably that's still the focus for [DATE-3].
EndUser: It's absolutely focused since when we spoke last time we've now.
EndUser: So if I go back maybe, if I go back a year and then very quickly jump [DATE-4], so we stabilise the business and we developed a product, a vision as to what good look like, which effectively enabled us to have a [ORG-3] product that we could go to market with, which we've articulated in four bids.
EndUser: That was submitted, they were waiting feedback on .
EndUser: We don't know if any of those have been successful yet , we've got four bits that we've been full an d There are 10 maybe 23 further bids that are in the pipeline for [DATE-5].
EndUser: So we expect them to fall thick and fast and [DATE-6]. So we've sort of in this sort of [DATE-7].
EndUser: Post-covid window whereby everything is coming out to tender so almost the entire patient transport market will come out to tender over the next over [DATE-8].
EndUser: Aside from that we are also looking at other specialist transport opportunities that we might be able to deliver anything from.
EndUser: Sort of blue light services. So there is a route to market from what we do to being able to offer the sort of blue light services.
EndUser: And then there's opportunities within prisoner escorting and secure mental health that we would also like to get ourselves into a position to bid for.
Agent: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think it was a similar enough position when we last spoke.
Agent: I think you were kind of saying that there was almost too many bids for you to manage, which is always a great thing to hear from a business development standpoint.
Agent: And I suppose what needs to change for you to be able to keep up with those bids for you to be able to manage that?
EndUser: Well, I guess supply and demand, isn't it?
EndUser: If we've got the clarity of what bids are in our pipeline and when they're going to fall.
EndUser: Then we can assess as an organization what resource capability Obviously, we've got the internal resources that we've got, but depending on what that looked like, if there was a shortfall, then obviously that's a slightly different
Agent: We have to be able to meet that demand.
Agent: Challenge for the business.
Agent: And how does that process look at [TIME-3]?
Agent: Like, did this kind of bid management and I suppose resource allocation?
EndUser: So we have a pipeline that was created probably [DATE-9] and hasn't really
Agent: Been updated since.
EndUser: Although that pipeline just didn't fall when anyone expected it, so we know what bids are coming up. We really don't have any idea. when exactly when those bids are going to happen.
EndUser: We don't currently have the sort of market engagement communication with the trust to get improved clarity around that. So that's maybe something
Agent: That can improve.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, so I think when we last spoke, one of the things we were looking at was kind of identification of potential bids, what was really good and that was clear, but I suppose that following through was lacking, the kind of lack of processes in place and from kind of pre-bid to clothes, what weren't there, is that still the case?
EndUser: To some extent, yes, because if I go back to the fitting environment or work, it's kind of work winning environment that I've been part of before. dependent on the size of the bids.
EndUser: Some bids were looked at as campaigns whereby actually there would be some work that started maybe [DATE-10] out from the bids.
EndUser: Some of these bids were joint ventures, but ultimately, the strategy around each bid is slightly different.
EndUser: And what I would like to happen is actually if we, based on the visibility of what we've got upcoming, the process shouldn't start at the point of which the [ORG-5] lands, it should start depending on the size of the bid at some point before so that we've, We've already got a solution in place.
EndUser: We've identified customer pain points. We've collaborated with whomever we've got to collaborate. We might have even had a, if we know something's going to come up in a [DATE-13]'s time, we might already have had a conversation.
EndUser: And with somebody
Agent: Within
EndUser: A trust, all of that pre-work isn't currently happening. I think they drink a lot of facts down to visibility of when the contracts are going to end.
EndUser: And it's about going back to that when we were talking on [DATE-13]. It's about building that pipeline from scratch and just making sure that the data that's in it is reliable and accurate.
EndUser: So that on your pipeline, you know [TIME-4] in advance that this is either going to go for an extension Or we can get in and start to talk to the customer about what their requirements are or show them a new bit of kit We've got and that type of thing and that's where that pipeline
Agent: Building is the key that unlocks all of that Everything else all of that other activity And
EndUser: A present are using sales force to manage this pipeline or where is that being managed?
EndUser: So [DATE-9], we developed the pipeline from the information that I believe is available on contracts finder.
Agent: Had a consultant who
EndUser: Well, I think [PERSON-9], correct me. If we're all all. all the information would be available there. So we can develop the pipeline from [ORG-6]. And ideally that would be developed.
Agent: That information would then be put into [ORG-2]
EndUser: And we would use [ORG-2] as a tool.
EndUser: But that's not happening at present, does it not?
EndUser: No, because we haven't had the resources,
Agent: But [PERSON-13]'s just come on board, which potentially provides us with the ability to do that work. Yeah, fantastic.
EndUser: So our present is it kind of just being done manually with no real cadence in place?
EndUser: To some extent, yes, and win a bid lands.
Agent: We wanted to contract finder
Agent: We panic for [TIME-5] and then we get on with it. That's all too familiar. Yeah.
Agent: What was starting up?
Agent: [PERSON-1], I [PERSON-4], scally, thanks for joining. Sorry if I missed finders at an internal app you've this.
EndUser: What exactly is contracts
EndUser: Developed yourself?
EndUser: I heard a consultant.
EndUser: What how is that you being used?
EndUser: No, that's the government contracts finder. Okay. So it's about transparency of the contracts that are awarded.
EndUser: How long the contract is often you can find a redacted contract?
EndUser: In there although that's not very useful generally but yeah it's based on the government website and where everything that's advertised through procurement rules goes on there so you can often do a fair bit of digging to to find out how long the contract was exactly what day it was awarded how many years extensions it might have on it who it was awarded to who it was taken from all that kind of stuff you can go and manually build a pipeline from there and then equally from a sales force perspective, absolutely right.
EndUser: I think we'd do a piece of work to identify what it was that we were looking to bid and allocate those to [ORG-2].
EndUser: We wouldn't necessarily add on 46 opportunities onto [ORG-2] and we know we're only going to bid 10 of them. Number one, it's a lot of work.
EndUser: Number two, it seems to skew a lot of data from people where your pipeline looks like it's worth [MONEY-1]. but you actually only bid 9 million of it.
EndUser: So we just take a fair chunk of what [DATE-13] [DATE-13] looks like to add to [ORG-2] and then maintain that from a rebear to keep perspective or create a new record for it if it's been awarded to somebody else.
EndUser: And manage that from there.
Agent: But we do salesforce primarily for the reporting side rather than the
EndUser: Pipeline management side I say.
EndUser: And what is it you use for your pipeline management?
EndUser: So for [ORG-3] it's manual [PERSON-1] isn't it and it's that you know a bit of well panic in other parts of the business where the bids are bigger and longer, [ORG-2] is a really effective tool for us to manage the pipeline because they're [DATE-11] deals, you know, when they're coming around, there's not that many of them.
EndUser: So yeah, so from the prison side, we tend to use [ORG-2] in a different way as in all of the opportunities are loaded on [ORG-2] and we know when we've lost, we know when that rebid's going to take place.
EndUser: It's a lot kind of there's a lot more clarity around it. Whereas we need to have lots and lots and lots of
Agent: Smaller regional bids like the [ORG-3] guys see,
Agent: It's just it's just a different kind of fish. Understood. Sorry, [PERSON-4], I think I could across you there. Oh, good, mate. I think. Yeah, I.
Agent: That [PERSON-1] should have introduced myself. [PERSON-6] and I split the accounts. It's a global account. You guys have 653,000 employees and the new entity. So it's a big job to globally support LIG4S.
Agent: So that's my funny accent [TIME-2]. But anyway, I think we've got, it's funny, [PERSON-13], I mentioned I live near [GPE-9], [GPE-10], here in [LOC-2]. And we've got a very similar approach with [GPE-13] federal contracts.
Agent: I think what I'm hearing is that, Since these are taxpayer funded projects, they need to make them public and it needs to be open and transparent about where the government's spending their money. We have the same concept here.
Agent: And I don't want to speak in a term, [PERSON-11], you might know this better than I do, but with the [ORG-7] or with the [GPE-3] government, you know, here in the [GPE-6], we've got, we have tools.
Agent: There are connectors that can feed directly to [ORG-2] from these government kind of procurement sites. So, for example, like the department of.
Agent: Fish and wildlife and the [ORG-8] and all these [GPE-13] agencies, they run very similar sales, these agencies use [ORG-2] and they're running a similar kind of concept as you just described and they have a department of whom I'm on security, all the defense contracts coming in, et cetera, there's thousands of them, small and large,
EndUser: And there's a way to get those directly piped into [ORG-2] and you can kind of act on the within [ORG-2] rather than having kind of a go between. So we can look into that for you as well.
EndUser: I mean, that sounds really
EndUser: Good,
Agent: Doesn't it, [PERSON-1]?
Agent: I think that that approach of having a single source of truth is absolutely where you guys need to get to. Absolutely. And sorry if I missed it.
EndUser: [PERSON-9], I know you're very well versed in [ORG-2]. [PERSON-1], is your me for different purposes.
Agent: Team using [ORG-2] [DATE-2]?
EndUser: Excuse Do you have licenses for all your users?
EndUser: No, and we don't know how to use [ORG-2]. I've never been to a soldie that I have used. Salesforce before, but it might not be the same product that you've got [DATE-2].
Agent: But we're not actively using [ORG-2] and we could do with some training to ensure that, to get, to get licenses, but being sure that we are using it in the correct way. Oh, good.
Agent: Let me give you like a second overview of the account or the relationship.
Agent: So you folks have [DATE-16] users using [ORG-2] across allied G4s in the states and in [LOC-3] for the most part, some in [LOC-4], [GPE-13], [ORG-9] as well, some in [LOC-5], but mainly [NORP-1], and [PERSON-16].
Agent: You're a [ORG-1] as especially was a very sophisticated user of [ORG-2] allied not so much allied actually. allocated all their users onto the [NORP-2] legacy [ORG-10] instance because [ORG-13] had a much more sophisticated approach to [ORG-2] usage.
Agent: So you guys are pretty far down the path. You've got sponsorship all the way up to the executive level in [GPE-7] and in [GPE-8]. So this isn't kind of like a, you've been a customer for [DATE-11].
Agent: So a lot of people are using [ORG-2] across a lot of different ways. [ORG-13] maintenance cyber as well as man guarding. and your business would be kind of new to this as well. So it's a big existing relationship.
Agent: We've got a lot of resources already in place for tutorials and for learning and things like that. So just so you know what you're dealing with, it's not kind of a small engagement. It's big on both sides.
Agent: And I should mention we're a big user of. [PERSON-11], you guys do all the man guarding for all our headquarters in [GPE-13] and in [GPE-8]. So it's a big reciprocal mutually beneficial
EndUser: Partnership that we have going on here.
EndUser: Perfect. So, so, so how, how would we get the training is that would that be delivered by yourselves
Agent: Or do we just [ORG-13] have super users that would be able to be able to put us in touch with. Yeah, there's a couple different ways.
Agent: So, so we, I mean, you do need a license to use the tool. So we can talk about that. Um, let's table that just for a second.
Agent: But if you wanted to go right after this call, you're going to laugh, but the easiest quickest way is you could just go to [PRODUCT-1] and type in how to create an opportunity in [ORG-2].
Agent: It's [TIME-6] long and it's self-paced and you can watch it 10 times. If, if, uh, if you get distracted and you got to come back to it, that's easy.
Agent: We also have to, the next step up, we've got a free tool called trail. Trailhead Just [ORG-13] Salesforce Trailhead. There's hundreds, if not thousands, of 23 to 36-minute self-paced tutorials, also free that you can learn from.
Agent: The next step up would be like a classroom setting. I don't think you guys need that. That would be a fee-based service.
Agent: And then we also have, since you guys are kind of super users, the licenses you have, there's a kind of a dedicated resource for these things, which is called Premier Support. They do.
Agent: Fast start training, they do tutorials, they do that kind of stuff. So there's a bunch of ways to to get started.
EndUser: So so [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-11], I guess question for you, do you work with like [PERSON-23] and [PERSON-14]?
Agent: I would,
EndUser: [PERSON-23]. Yeah. So I mean, I work really close to with them in terms of how we manage [ORG-2] and what that looks like.
EndUser: And we're trying to plan in place to make sure that we've got each area of the business within cars has a [ORG-2] user who is to in the work on [ORG-2], but then feeds into me rather than me doing all of the work on [ORG-2] and then feeding it to myself.
EndUser: So we have got a plan in place. There's some moves around with between [PERSON-23] and [PERSON-23] in terms of the structure and how those guys work together.
EndUser: So yeah, we've already got the start of a plan to make sure that there's licenses, make sure that there's training.
EndUser: Yeah, and I think, I mean, I think [ORG-2] is that thing where if you get it wrong, it's very obvious and you'll find out about it because you'll be on someone's spreadsheet and then you get in trouble over it.
EndUser: So I would just hold off on training until that comes from [PERSON-23] or someone because I think in the [GPE-3] we might have a very specific way of how we manage it and how we use it and I would hate [PERSON-1] for you to go on the wrong path and then all of us have like a red flag next to your name and be a super we'll start again Okay, so we so obviously
EndUser: We just delete everything and then
EndUser: [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-13] are freely available to be able to provide that supporting element to obviously put stuff into sales force that feeds into your, feeds into uniquely, but we'll leave it with the unique to come to have those conversations with those two people about how we go about doing that.
EndUser: Yeah, I think you might hear something in [DATE-23] about what the plan is and how we move that forward. They were, they were waiting for [PERSON-23] to come over really too.
EndUser: To just see how we could kind of like straighten the business out in that sense. I mean, I think there's two and a half thousand employees in.
EndUser: Are but if the business in cars and I am the only sales force user and the [GPE-13], that's it. Just to give you some element of that's how tightly controlled
Agent: It is at present and it definitely needs to be more kind of like business, individual business unit led.
Agent: Yeah, actually the, it's all only about never go with the cash solutions division and I'm speaking to [PERSON-25] there and she was saying that she's the kind of similar role, that she's the the
EndUser: Soul kind of self-appointed almost sales force admin I guess, but she was saying as well that there does seem to be a plan in place to kind of get to an important. And I think it's that change
Agent: In the structure in terms of [PERSON-23] and his role, that's what's created some momentum in terms of making sure we've got all the right people using sales force. Yep. And just from my own knowledge, how many
EndUser: Staff members would require access within patient transport?
Agent: How many users would there be?
Agent: Two. [PERSON-28] and [PERSON-7].
EndUser: Just sales staff are within the
Agent: Two users. And how many
Agent: Division?
EndUser: One. We're in the division. We're in [ORG-3]. I guess it's just clear with me. Okay, brilliant. With my oversight. At the moment. Okay, fantastic. From a divisional perspective, we're part of cars. So [PERSON-13], it probably helps
EndUser: That better than me. But just as a business, I don't know what we would be described as, but if we were a business unit that was part of the car.
EndUser: It's a business within cars, isn't it?
EndUser: I think. and similarly, the community contracts would probably be two the prisons
Agent: And the kind of like just this element would probably be two as well.
Agent: So it's not huge numbers, it's just making sure that the right people have the right training and access. Access, yeah, perfect.
Agent: So what don't we do?
Agent: I know we're out of time folks.
Agent: We'll [PERSON-1] and team will send you a link with or sending email with a few links if you just want to get started at your own leisure to check out the free training if you want to watch a few videos just to kind of get you speeds.
Agent: Hopefully when get your, uh, get your access.
EndUser: You do.
Agent: You'll be able to hit the ground running. I have it to help there. Yeah.
Agent: That's And [PERSON-9], do you mind?
EndUser: Great. Thank you very much. Yeah, sure.
Agent: Could you hang on for [TIME-7]?
Agent: [PERSON-9], I have a couple of questions around cars and stuff.
Agent: Do you have a hard stop right now?
Agent: Yes, sure. [TIME-8]. Oh, good. Awesome. [PERSON-11], maybe, uh, you know, we can let the other folks go above and beyond that. I think we, uh, we want to
EndUser: Help
Agent: [PERSON-9] with
EndUser: Some of her other initiatives here.
EndUser: But,
EndUser: Uh, rest of you folks. Thank you. Appreciate
Agent: It. Thanks very much. Thanks a lot guys. Bye.
Agent: So [PERSON-9], thanks. I heard that you're the only person supporting 2354 people.
EndUser: It sounds like you need help.
EndUser: How can we help you?
EndUser: Are you overwhelmed?
EndUser: Are you ready to quit or what?
EndUser: Now it's all good. So, [ORG-3], it's so, so I used to just look after the prison secure training centres, community contracts, this kind of just this part of the cavalry rehabilitation services business.
EndUser: And then [ORG-3], patient transport, belong to another part of the company and then patient transport's moved into cars.
EndUser: So we've essentially taken on, so my kind of sales force went from these kind of every, you know, once a year, every [DATE-14] type big deals, that's what wheels worked on, big, these big kind of like campaigns, big deals.
EndUser: From a prison site, the community contract site is definitely smaller and a little bit more ad hoc, but that's manageable for those guys.
EndUser: To the [ORG-3] guys coming over and having, you know, bids coming out of their ears, where we want to bid on this, want to bid on that, and I'm going, well, there's nothing on [ORG-2], there is no pipeline.
EndUser: And that's the point that we need to get to They have a pipeline, they understand it, they can plot and plan their work and what to campaign, what's a bit of an ad hoc if we've got some spare resource, that type of approach.
EndUser: That's where those guys need to get to and I've spoken to them.
EndUser: But yeah, in terms of, so the management of [ORG-2] for me went from me probably having 23 records in [ORG-2], live open records in [ORG-2] that were these big kind of one-off opportunities that would come around to 35 plus ad hoc random [ORG-3] ones with all eyes on me about managing them.
EndUser: So that's where that additional workload came in. We've resolved what's in [ORG-2], but what we haven't resolved is this wider pipeline piece, and that's the bit that they really need to get into doing.
EndUser: I've said to them, essentially, it's a half a [DATE-23]'s work. If you sat down and went through [ORG-13],
EndUser: All the information's out there, we just need to find a way to consolidate it and apply it to a pipeline and then work out what to do with it.
EndUser: But yeah, [PERSON-23] and [PERSON-23], I worked really closely with them. and they are absolutely fantastic.
EndUser: And we've got a bit of a plan in place coming up about how who we allocate [ORG-2] licenses to and how they use those licenses because yeah I should be reviewing a lot of that
Agent: Data and not producing it as well and updating it every month. No kidding. So there's a lot of ways we can make your life easier. We've got some ideas from other customers as well as other areas within [GPE-11].
Agent: So I G4s cash business, which [PERSON-11] mentioned earlier, is that part of the cars division too?
EndUser: Guess like the
Agent: Good night.
Agent: No?
Agent: Okay. Which, what, I'm sorry for my ignorance.
Agent: What are the, what are the kind of components or the dimensions of the car's business?
EndUser: He said 2587 people, it sounds like we're not servicing those people at all. I'm just curious what teams they comprise.
Agent: It's all while they're all prisons related mostly.
EndUser: That's the [GPE-6], I don't think
Agent: Not a business you have in right, I don't think allied has a prison division. Nine. Okay, that's why I'm not familiar.
Agent: So you guys do like, is it dumb question?
EndUser: Is it just armored like transport between like a trial date and a jail?
Agent: Is that what the process is?
Agent: No, it's full management
EndUser: Of the jail. Oh, I see. So like, like prison guards and things like that.
Agent: Yeah. Okay, and there's twenty five hundred Yeah, that's that include the guards or is that mainly sales if that's guards That's everyone okay.
EndUser: People you mentioned
EndUser: People in office office workers?
Agent: No, How many people like in an office like yourself like sales people or service people or managers or things like that It's like [PERCENT-1] of them in an office or is it like 90?
EndUser: You know [PERCENT-2] of them less than that in terms of like sales. You're probably thinking which don't use [ORG-2] yet
Agent: Five is my theme. And those people either. Okay. Yeah, I think that's why you guys are having the challenge.
Agent: If you're all using the tool and you all have visibility into it and people can run their business and sales force. And it shouldn't be a big deal because you have a big relationship with us.
Agent: There either should be licenses on the shelf that you know, you have a very deep discount.
EndUser: They can use or,
Agent: So it's a new licenses could be added. I think that's the benefit. And then there's also, I'm sure you've heard all about how [PRODUCT-2] is changing every industry, but.
Agent: You know, we can bring kind of some predictive [PRODUCT-2] tools to the table to say, hey, here's .
Agent: You know, based on the data, here are some trends within the prison industry and prison services industry and maybe there's Maybe there's new technology or new approaches that are being used and you want to kind of help introduce those to your clients.
Agent: You can do it that way. It sounds like you're doing a lot of things manually and it sounds like a lot of it's falling on your shoulders
Agent: And there's ways we can help. And I think that's one of the conversations. Again, I'm probably getting the name wrong here, but we'd call it kind of central G4S. So [PERSON-25] and [PERSON-23] and a C. Some [PERSON-22].
Agent: Of those guys are what we call [PERSON-13], the sales ops director here reports to [PERSON-26]. You know, [PERSON-25].
Agent: This is all man guarding stuff So that they'd all be completely
EndUser: Separate to you, [PERSON-13] Would they ?
EndUser: Or less as [GPE-3] then are they?
Agent: They are. Well, [ORG-11].
EndUser: I'm sorry, what was the acronym used?
EndUser: Secure Is that
Agent: These guys?
Agent: I don't know about [ORG-16]. [PERSON-23] is an agency director of sales operations. He reports to [PERSON-35], who's like the global [ORG-11] based out of [GPE-7].
Agent: I think eventually you guys all roll up to one like who's your who's your Net for your
EndUser: In a country leader [PERSON-36] okay. Yeah [PERSON-36] VMD managing director of the cars business and what's [PERSON-40]'s last
Agent: He reports into [PERSON-36] name?
Agent: Sorry?
EndUser: [PERSON-22] name It's
Agent: Um, isn't it?
Agent: A real sensek. That's a good one. So, uh, yeah, I mean, [PERSON-36] knows [ORG-2]. Well, I think [PERSON-36] and [PERSON-26] are peers and they both work with [PERSON-36].
Agent: So as we, but [PERSON-9], it's good because we like to talk to somebody like yourself who actually no offense to the higher ups.
Agent: They sometimes they have, they're a bit too above the clouds and they don't see what's actually going on the ground and what people are struggling with and what they need. So this is helpful to us.
Agent: And we can, we just want to get you the the tools that you need so we can help because you have a big relationship with us and we want to be able to
Agent: Get you what you need. And that's really what we're here for as well is to make sure you're getting the most out of this relationship.
Agent: Yeah, but it's interesting to see obviously the conversations we have at [ORG-23] is such a big company that's some of the conversations that we've been having thus.
Agent: You know, I thought you would have been aware of haven't kind of filtered down. So it's good to set, you know, time aside to see exactly what it is you need
Agent: On a more kind of granular level, you know. Yeah.
EndUser: [PERSON-38], are you based in [GPE-8]?
EndUser: I'm just there.
Agent: So I'm an hour or so from [GPE-8]. Good. Not far. We've got I've been over [DATE-23]. We've got a we've got a [ORG-2] world tour, which is kind of like a one day symposium.
Agent: That's pretty interesting. It sounds like.
Agent: [ORG-2] is an important part of your job, and it would be good for your career and things like that if the more you learn about it, right?
Agent: So we'll include you on things like one day events and dinners and stuff going forward, because I think it would be beneficial for you to be, for us to keep closer
EndUser: Ties with you to make sure you're getting what you need.
Agent: Yeah, that sounds great, thank you. And even kind of webinars and stuff, we've lost that kind of toy in with this training piece we're talking about.
Agent: And so we'll definitely make more of an effort to keep you posted on, you know, new releases, new innovations and things that we think could benefit you.
EndUser: Yeah, great and then I mean we're definitely making a conscious effort to join up with other parts of the business Because obviously they've got sales teams running beds running pipelines So a lot we're trying to kind of do a lot of best practice sharing because I think sometimes that is the problem that we are so Yeah And you don't know people from you know, the other side of the business.
Agent: Big
EndUser: So yeah, we're definitely trying to do that. So yeah, that's uh, that's all
Agent: Good Good And just in closing here, [PERSON-9], thank you for staying extra here with us. You mentioned that you're having internal discussions now about getting some things approved, etc.
Agent: Is that how we want to handle next steps?
Agent: Like are you kind of requesting licensing for these folks and that's to be determined or where do we go from here?
EndUser: Yeah, so I just need to identify, I think, two people from each kind of mini business unit within cars, I think is the approach that I'm going to take.
EndUser: And I'm on with [PERSON-23], but I have [DATE-23] meeting with [PERSON-23], regular catch-ups with [PERSON-23]. So it's part of that kind of process where [PERSON-23] was waiting for [PERSON-23] to kind of come over to work for him directly.
EndUser: And then I think we'll just take it from there and allocate the licenses to the right people.
Agent: Good. Just a thought, you know, [PERSON-1], I think mentioned that his two people would be the only folks from his team that would need it.
Agent: But I think [PERSON-1] would benefit from a license himself because I think he would want visibility and some of the [PRODUCT-2] stuff we talked about, the dashboards and some of the insights that provides.
Agent: He can't access those unless he is a yeah, I think license as well.
EndUser: So if I think for me, it would be [PERSON-1], [PERSON-7], and that he's kind of commercial
Agent: [PERSON-13] on the basis as well.
Agent: I think I'm reporting perspective as well and I probably going to put him to be able to kind of visualize what's going Yeah, definitely.
Agent: On beneath them. Yeah, you don't want the individual contributors to be using it and then their VOSC doesn't have access to it and see what they're doing. So you want to be able to give him insights too.
EndUser: Yeah, makes sense.
Agent: Okay, thank you, [PERSON-9]. We appreciate you going over here with us. But it's interesting stuff. We always like to talk about talk to the new Not new, but new to yeah.
EndUser: Us, at least new kind of. Yeah, I need to,
Agent: Because man-guarding, I think it's what, like [PERCENT-3] of the overall global business.
Agent: And when we talk to the people on the janitorial side or cyber or maintenance, they're like, hey, don't forget about us, you know, bolt-on, that's what bolt-on.
EndUser: So we like to... Yeah, the little we are.
Agent: A little Hey, it's an important cog in the wheel though, so we appreciate it.
EndUser: Yeah, thank you so much for your time [DATE-2] as well. I really
Agent: Appreciate it.
Agent: Thank you. I'll see you have our details. So if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. We're always here
EndUser: For you. Yeah, we'll do.
Agent: Thank you so much. [PERSON-13], cheers.
EndUser: Bye. Bye, bye.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. While the call involved several key stakeholders from both the seller's and customer's sides, it is not explicitly stated if the decision-maker for the deal was present or not. The agreed-upon next steps include the seller sending a link with free training resources and an email with further information. The customer, [PERSON-9], mentioned they would identify two people from each business unit within cars to allocate licenses to and would discuss this further with [PERSON-23]. However, it is not explicitly stated if these individuals are the decision-makers for the deal.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""What exactly is contracts finder and how is it being used?"" The customer seemed more engaged after this question because it led to a discussion about the government contracts finder and how it can be used to build a pipeline from scratch. This is an important topic for the customer, as they are trying to manage a large number of bids and need better visibility into when they will fall.

2. ""How does the process look for bid management and resource allocation?"" This question seemed to engage the customer because it addressed a specific challenge they are facing in managing the high volume of bids they are dealing with. The customer expressed a need for clarity around this process, and the sales rep's question showed that they understand this need and are interested in helping the customer find a solution.

3. ""What resources are currently in place for pipeline management and how can they be improved?"" The customer seemed more engaged after this question because it showed that the sales rep is interested in understanding the customer's current processes and helping them improve. The customer discussed the manual nature of their current pipeline management and the need for a more consistent cadence. The sales rep's question showed that they are aware of these challenges and are interested in finding ways to help the customer overcome them.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:
- ""What was starting up?""
- ""How can we help you?""
- ""Are you overwhelmed?""
- ""Are you ready to quit or what?""
