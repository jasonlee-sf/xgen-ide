However, the customer's responses were cut off due to technical issues, and the rep did not follow up to ensure they fully understood the customer's needs and pain points.

The sales representative did a good job of guiding the customer through the process of using their product. However, there are a few instances where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

3. The sales rep could have asked more about the customer's plans after receiving the optimizer report, to better understand what they hope to achieve from the product.

4. The sales rep could have asked more about the customer's availability and preferences for the readout session, instead of suggesting a specific date.

EndUser: Mine's not. date, different event as much. So I wasn't like pressuring them too much. I just was like, I'm from my perspective, I wanted to be over because like,
Agent: I just don't want them to ask me to make any more changes. The other changes are going to change if you were in public, but you're aware of that. That's not a problem. Yeah. Okay, cool.
Agent: So that's kind of where we're at. And then, I mean, I'll be on the long end, and then we'll get it back hopefully [DATE-3] morning. Not so bad changes or updates or requests.
Agent: And it gets a little cleaner, which is cleaner when we left, depending on what to come back with. Our legal turns it around with those updates. So yes, or no.
Agent: But we want to align with that idea not either a call or we're getting like depending on how bad it is. So I think we're both at an end where we want to done.
Agent: So depending on hoping that we'll be later on, for the non- OK. So we'll see how those go play. So that's kind of the update on that.
Agent: And then hopefully we can get a call and call with, like, the rest of the team. Just to kind of finalize everything and just be more of which should be, like, yay.

EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: So then you run rules and then that will not be left based off of it. Then you'll see what that list looks like.
Agent: And then you can, I would just build lists like that and say, okay, these people haven't been active in forever. I need to get under my threshold and this is how I'm going to do it.

Agent: Lightning experience before?
Agent: That's completely free. Like it's inside of your [PRODUCT-1]. I just thought like there's a lot more capabilities inside of there like the drag and drop email builder. Um, Here, actually, let me just share my screen real quick.
Agent: And then that way, if it is something that you're interested in, then you can just start utilizing it, turn it on and start utilizing it.

Agent: Okay,
Agent: So this is something that's available to you now. It's actually inside of [PRODUCT-1], which is great because then you can toggle between back and forth between [PRODUCT-1] and [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: Very similar to the old UI that you still have your home, you've got your dashboard, your prospects, and [ORG-1] email.
EndUser: Mmm.
Agent: Um, still the same way, your templates, your tests, but something that's really cool that a lot of my clients like is the new drag and drop email filter.
Agent: So if I were to click on this email content, I look up [PERSON-2]'s great email, you have the drag and drop functionality.
Agent: Um, I have a few customers that rely on consultants to create email templates for them or sometimes they are very limited on the email templates that they can create in the classic builder with this new life.
Agent: Experience, you can simply just drag and drop .
Agent: And decide, okay, what do you want in there?
Agent: Do I want an image here?
Agent: Maybe I don't like these three columns. I'm gonna add just one column down here, and add a button, a lot more flexibility.

The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's current situation and providing a solution to their problem of managing email opens and readership scores. However, there is an opportunity where the rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs regarding the use of the Lightning experience.

When introducing the Lightning experience, the rep mentioned its features and benefits, but did not ask if the customer had any specific needs or pain points that the new experience could address. The rep could have asked open-ended questions to uncover any challenges the customer is facing with their current UI and how the Lightning experience could help solve those challenges.

Additionally, the rep could have asked if the customer has any concerns or objections about switching to the new experience. By doing so, the rep could have addressed any potential blockers and increased the likelihood of the customer making a positive decision about the product.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed interest in the drag and drop email builder feature of the lightning experience, which is available for free within their current product.

EndUser: So as we understand, when we actually renew with the Enterprise solution, so it goes with the [GPE-1] right now.
EndUser: So we actually have a really brief understanding from you guys when we understand what [GPE-1], but when we hope to actually make use of this, so we hope to actually learn more, actually gather more stakeholders.
EndUser: Expression our IT to learn more about the capability of [GPE-1] and about how we are going to get it started to use it.
EndUser: So for example is that any set up we need to do before we can see meaningful insights or meaningful statements before we can actually make sure that for our data operation or if there's any skills or whatever we need to make use of the [GPE-1] abou t the introduction of the interface, etc I think it's both on the technical side and on actually th e introduction of the capability of [GPE-1] So we can make better planning on the resources We can work with our like our agency [PRODUCT-1] on any customization we need to make and we need to make a plan or like best practice for internal uses to keep on using [ORG-1] So we'll see how you think.
EndUser: Yeah, I think [PERSON-1],
Agent: I can jump in quickly on this. No problem. I think what we can do is we can arrange, because it has been quite some time. I think almost half a year ago since we spent. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah. So
Agent: There has been quite some updates as well, especially on the [PRODUCT-2] front.
Agent: So maybe what we can do is we have another, you know, kind of a demonstration again of the particular platform, you know, maybe quite a few features that will be, you know, I guess useful for [ORG-2] itself.
Agent: And potentially we might also present some trails in terms of Enablement that you and your team can take But at [DATE-2], I think it also depends heavily on your plan with your Implementation partner It sounds like [ORG-3] will be the one that will be doing Hopefully we'll be doing the heavy lifting for you guys .
Agent: Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. I think that there will be mainly, I think, the plan for the next session. Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Great. Great.
Agent: It's your health and supplements. So I think once we can get the order of confirmation, let's say by [DATE-3], because I also chat with [PERSON-2] this today, he said the order from is already on the CEO table.
EndUser: Oh great,
Agent: That's great. Get it signed by [DATE-3] that we will also get this as a proof that to get the mobilized the internal resource and to also see when can we arrange this workshop.

video_04080_167_6qr3y000000sYgqAAE,"Speaker 4: Okay, so I have been going back and forth internally. So this information was sent by [PERSON-1] and who is the most knowledgeable person, but he says that he doesn't know much.
Speaker 4: What I'm hearing is, this is being used to digitize financial account summaries in [ORG-1].
Speaker 4: Is that the right to use of this?
Speaker 4: I talked to him, I'll be using it for When they are expecting, when they are trying to onboard the client and they're sending all the documents and expecting to sign on those documents, I thought they may be using S-tots because it generates a PDF with a secure sign-in option.
Agent: Are you?
Agent: Yeah, go ahead.
Agent: Is that the only use to get that acetation effect effectively to say, hey, I've seen this sort of gotten this?
Speaker 4: Yeah, hold on a second, let me see what I can. I think that is what I heard. I'm unable to find the right person within the business team who can give an answer. I already sent internally.
Speaker 4: And the only answer I got is yes, we use it, but we use it selectively.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 4: Let me see whether I can get any other information. But I think I also did a little bit of study on S-docs. And I thought, The answer is ours.
Agent: While you're pulling that up.
Agent: I know that, like, out of the box with [ORG-1], which I believe you have, there comes like a tear sheet option and we have like an acetation omelet script that you can also leverage to be captured like, hey, I'm saying or I'm asserting that I've seen this or I've gotten this or all that good jargon.
Agent: So you, if that's really your only use case for S stocks, I think we could then, because of what you're already paying in licensing with [ORG-1], you could deprecate S stocks.
Agent: And the quickest way to find out what other ways you're using is just like turn off the licenses for people and see who complains first about what they can do. about and then go from there .
Speaker 4: Is that a way by looking at the system?
Speaker 4: Can you find out what they are doing with this docs?

Speaker 4: Legal.
Agent: It would be legal. I would want to definitely stop the recording, just for your sake. But I don't know that we could, within the timeframe of this, call to find all the nitty gritty places that they're using it.
Agent: I could just see very quickly who could be the licensing and you could talk to them directly like who's got a license and aside from that, I think that would be truly the best course of action is to know which users, which is like the feature permission said, going directly to those users and going, hey, are you actively using this?
Speaker 4: To sign it out to them
Agent: If not, cool, great. We're turning it off.
Agent: If so, how are you using it?
Agent: Tell me the nitty-gritty so we can go from there.

Agent: Or to be so I'd rather solve that problem for you .
Agent: Voluminous and
Speaker 4: Yeah, so when I looked at test docs, it said right it is for doc
Speaker 4: And that's one use case that I saw. There may be other use cases. As you said, I will not talk to the team and figure out if you can stop the recording, I can share. Yeah.

Agent: It's a new feature by [ORG-1].
Speaker 2: Perfect.
Agent: Let me share my screen.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 2: Can you see my screen?
Agent: I'm on [PERSON-1] page.
Agent: Perfect. So voicemail drop feature is available and is native to [ORG-2]. But this capability comes with another license called [ORG-3] that I believe [NORP-1] does not have.
Agent: So I just wanted to call that piece out just where it happens. Now the way voicemail drop works is so once you take [ORG-3] every every user will have the flexibility to record up to 16 different voicemail messages.
Agent: They can do that. by going into the voicemail settings. And here they can configure their own voicemail greeting message. And then here they can configure those 16 voicemail drop messages.
Agent: So again, depending on the customer or depending on the campaign or depending on the season.
Speaker 2: They
Agent: Can configure different messages. One important thing to note when we talk about voicemail drop feature is. When the call is made, so let's say the alert is installed, voicemail drops are configured.
Agent: Now the sales rep is on [PERSON-1] page and he wants to call [PERSON-1]. So he just initiates that call.
Agent: So one important thing to note here is for sales rep is they should opt or they should select the voicemail that they want to drop only after the beat.
Agent: So when you call someone and you get this beep, right?
Agent: Ok, drop the voicemail now. This feature works only after you drop that voicemail after them. So that is one important thing. So I'm calling [PERSON-1]. [PERSON-2] is not picking.
Agent: So here I see all the voicemail drop messages that I have that I have stored in my voicemail settings. I can just drop one of those voicemail messages. And along with this, I can also, uh, Once
Speaker 2: The call is ended, I can
Agent: Add an activity
Speaker 2: To [PERSON-2]'s account.
Agent: And you're good to go.
Speaker 2: So that's in a nutshell, like voicemail drop feature bread.

So I believe with you with liberty already having or with compare I'm already having [PRODUCT-1] subscription, things may be compared to be easier.
Agent: Another, there are a few more capabilities that come with the sales dialer feature.
Agent: So we saw voicemail drop, another feature or some of the additional features that come with this is the reps have the ability to select their own number.
Agent: So just to show to [PERSON-4], the customer that [PERSON-5] who's a sales rep is calling from within the rally area. So I have the option to select a local number. Or I can choose also like a custom
Speaker 2: A different number number that the system can generate Does it make sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like that putting their own number there even better Is there a way to put a word like or?
Agent: Compare in know because sometimes you get a caller ID word instead of a number.
Speaker 2: You
Speaker 2: I Don't think
Agent: So Okay, that's a good point. I can I can get back to you.
Speaker 2: Take that as a feedback and Okay, I don't suppose that I see what you're saying like call
Agent: An ID basically. So when someone calls you see comparing on others exactly, you know, attack a letter is not a number. That's a good question. Let me find that out, [PERSON-5], but I'm not sure yet.
Agent: So mainly, so these are some of the important or some of the features voicemail drop.

Agent: Does that help?

EndUser: And expect it to work. That's not how it works. That's the answer I got. I got it [DATE-2]. It has to be one or the other. Right. It cannot be a discount. The contracted pricing doesn't work.
Agent: The discount on the contracted pricing doesn't work on the user-entered less price.
EndUser: But that's fine. Just don't make it 111. Make it zero. I mean, I would like it to be yes, zero is also better.
Agent: [PERCENT-1] the ideal solution, but Okay.
EndUser: Okay. Thank you for explaining that. Okay. So now I remote that if you saw, I remote that filter value just so that it doesn't run. And now if I add $[MONEY-1],
EndUser: It takes 1062. It doesn't give any discount. So the contract surprising is interfering
Agent: With the discounting.
EndUser: And that just changed by changing the filter value on that. Yes, I just removed the condition. So I just cleared it. So there is no discount on the maintenance products right now.
Agent: Or there's no contact with pricing on the maintenance because I car.
EndUser: Just removed it from this particular
Agent: Let's just say I deleted it. Okay. And then it works. All right, I'm going to stop this just so it's easy to share out.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer seemed to be experiencing some issues with the seller's product, particularly in terms of how discounts are being calculated and applied. They were trying to understand why the contracted pricing was not working as expected and were discussing potential solutions to this problem. However, they did not explicitly express whether or not the product meets their needs overall.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs when the customer mentioned the issue with the discount not being respected for a specific product category. The customer explained that they had a case where they were told that a list price needed to be defined on the product for the contracted pricing to work. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the specifics of this issue, such as how it is impacting the customer's use of the seller's product and if there are any workarounds that the customer has found to be effective. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's needs and provide more tailored assistance.

Additionally, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's use of the filter field and the prize rule that may be defined for it. The customer mentioned that the filter field is not out of the box and that there may be a prize rule defined to incorporate certain logic into it. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand how the customer is using this filter field and if they have encountered any issues with it in the past. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's needs and provide more targeted assistance."
video_04795_167_6qr3y000000g3whAAA,"Agent: Okay, there we go.
Speaker 2: All right, this recording, we're live.
Agent: Yes, it's recording. All
Speaker 2: Right, so. All
Speaker 2: Right, so you can see my still force window.
Agent: Yep, it's here.
Speaker 2: Stop and I'll log in.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I can see some of our cases there. Just early, so when it comes to the case tagging, I'll go to a recent case where we've been having a lot of discussion.
Speaker 2: This is one example. They can see a post here from [PERSON-1] an hour ago, and he's tagging three, four, five, six people.
Speaker 2: These six people, for the most part, are in that standard group that we'd want to tag for everything. If you add [PERSON-2], because we typically like tagging her for everything, that'd be seven. So.
Speaker 2: So if possible, it'd be great that when I go to make a post, if I make a post like this and just say, test, you know, test [PERSON-2], no one's gonna get an email notification about that.
Speaker 2: And what we're asking for is, hey, can I begin making posts like that without having to take this step of, you know, typing out Jackie typing out [PERSON-3] typing out [PERSON-4] on typing, you know, so you can see how the time would rack up and I have to remember who I'm tagging.
Speaker 2: And so, you know, even if it's just.
Speaker 2: It'd be ideal if it was I can just make my post here and by default that post will always send to a group that we can contro l Who's in that group ?
Speaker 2: The ideal case the next ideal case if that's not possibl e It'd be at least minimizing it down into you know, I can just say a t I'm making this up at group and then there's a group of people in that group, right?
Speaker 2: So at least it's [QUANTITY-1] is no tags, but bring it down to one thin g and then us being able to [PERSON-5] would be the big deal.
Speaker 2: Anything else that you want to add?
Agent: That would be my default as well. I would think that might work out.
Speaker 3: Okay.
Speaker 3: And I'll add that the glitch that I found when I tried to set that up for us is that some of the people in that group of seven that we want to be included, some of them are internal users and some are external users.
Speaker 3: So we would need one group that includes both internal and external users.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. So all these employees here, everyone but me there would be the internal and then if your account is internal external but.
Speaker 3: Myself and [PERSON-2], I don't know
Speaker 2: I use my internal one more often. Yeah. Okay. Yep. That's a good point. And this is the chatter of as well.
Speaker 3: Within the case that you were thinking
Speaker 2: We're talking the same language, [PERSON-6]. Yep. Okay. Cool.
Agent: Anything else you want to see while I'm sharing?
Speaker 2: The file. Oh, the file piece. Do you have the case number,
Speaker 3: [PERSON-2], or the one worth?
Speaker 3: I know we tested it around with one. We've already corrected the one that didn't work. I think it was [DATE-1] is the one we were.
Speaker 2: That we first noticed that on, but I've corrected.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so this so what was happening here?
Speaker 2: Ireland was I came into this case. I didn't see a particular file in here.
Speaker 2: I saw zero files, right?
Speaker 2: So I thought that we didn't have any files in here. So I uploaded a file you can see here on [DATE-2].
Speaker 2: But the reality is that [PERSON-2] had already uploaded the file on the different file name, but she had already uploaded it all.
Speaker 2: I just couldn't see it because she was using her internal account and she hadn't checked that flag to display to external I'm an external users and user.
Speaker 3: So once you do that, I can see it. And for the most part, our users remember to do that, but occasionally they forget like then.
Agent: And then that can cause downstream issues. Okay. All right, I'm following you there. I can share this video and get it in the right hands to and see what they say.
Speaker 2: Review
Agent: How best to do that. Okay. As I look at all this guys, I'm going to stop sharing, but I mean.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"Based on the transcript, the customer's top concerns about the seller's product were related to case tagging and file visibility. The customer expressed difficulty in tagging multiple people in a post and suggested the ability to create a default group for post notifications. They also mentioned an issue with internal and external users being included in the same group. Additionally, the customer brought up a problem with file visibility within cases, where files uploaded by internal users were not visible to external users due to a flag setting. The customer requested a solution to improve file visibility for both internal and external users.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?",Answer: The customer did not express a clear sentiment regarding whether the seller's product meets their needs. They were mainly discussing specific features related to case tagging and file sharing during the call.,Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer:

The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs when discussing the issue of post tagging. The customer mentioned that they would like to make posts without having to manually type out and remember the names of the people they want to tag. The sales rep acknowledged this and agreed that it would be ideal, but they did not inquire further about the customer's specific pain points or the impact of this issue on their workflow. Understanding the customer's needs in more detail would have allowed the sales rep to tailor their solution and potentially identify additional opportunities for the seller's product to add value.

Additionally, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs when discussing the issue of file visibility. The customer mentioned that they had uploaded a file but the sales rep couldn't see it because the customer had used their internal account and hadn't checked a flag to display it to external users. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's current process for file sharing and collaboration, and how the seller's product could improve this process.

Overall, the sales rep missed opportunities to understand the customer's needs in more detail, which could have led to a more tailored solution and a stronger potential for closing the deal."
video_04813_167_6qr3y000000oeAzAAI,"Agent: I will share my slides. All right, so for the [PRODUCT-1] piece, this model is pretty straightforward pricing. It's pretty specific. And so the for three licenses of [ORG-1] cloud, it would be $[MONEY-1] per user per month.
Agent: So the [DATE-1] investment would be 3,486. And then for the Scale Source Scheduler piece that I know that you had expressed some interest in, I was able to get the [DATE-2] price down to [DATE-3].
Agent: So for three users that puts you at 672 for that piece, which would put your overall investment for the [PRODUCT-1] and the scheduler at 4829. Okay. And then.
Agent: For just the [PRODUCT-1] piece a little bit more straightforward, it's going to be the three licenses 76 per user per month, 3,486 total.
EndUser: Okay. Type on the annual total.
Agent: One more time.
EndUser: I think there's a typo.
Agent: Oh my god, you're so right. 3,486 not 29,000. That is awesome.
EndUser: Sounds better. Okay, that's great. That's great. And for I have a question in regards to the the schedule or so if you have three.
EndUser: If you have three accounts or users with a schedule or tool, is it only those three users can be a part of the schedule or tool?
EndUser: Like there can be included into the calendar or they are the only three that are actually applying this the tool itself.
Agent: I think so. Are you asking, for example,
EndUser: Like if we have an advisor that's not in [ORG-2], but that we use them like irregularly, but we still want to include them into like if we're sending out like a book me tab, right?
EndUser: And we want to include them into that calendar.
EndUser: Is that possible or is that a separate that they would have to be integrated into [ORG-2]?
Agent: Um, that's a great question. I'm not I believe they'd have to be integrated to [ORG-2] at the very least they would at least you'd have to have access to their calendar.
Agent: Remind me, are you using Outlook or are you using like [ORG-3] calendar?
Agent: Calumly, okay.
Agent: And then for your email or using Outlook?
EndUser: Gmail.
Agent: Okay. So if you're
EndUser: Integrating with Gmail, you should be able to see anyone's [ORG-3] calendar, I believe. So if their events are on their [ORG-3] calendar, I believe you still be able to see them that way. Okay, all right.
EndUser: And then if we had additional,
Agent: If we added additional users, would the price stay the same?
Agent: Or would there be, was there a difference if you add more users?
Agent: If you wanted to add more users, I could probably get the price down a little bit. It wouldn't be a ton. But that's definitely something that I can work on.
Agent: And then In terms of like if you wanted to see what you can also do and what a lot of people do is like they might buy, starting three And they'll have their starting price.
EndUser: For example, like they're
Agent: And then if they choose to add on in bulk later, like let's say you wanted to add four more.
EndUser: In [DATE-4], we can work on getting you a discount on that additional spend on those additional licenses so that then going forward, you could lock in like a lower price.
EndUser: Okay, and then what is, how often does the billing change?
EndUser: Like, do you guys change your costs per user?
Agent: Like does it, change over time after every annual, like, after [DATE-5], or does it stay pretty much the same, like, it will always be 103?
Agent: So with in [DATE-6], what they've implemented is similar to a lot of other technology companies. There is a usually an uplift at renewal of between five
EndUser: And [PERCENT-1], just depending. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, contracts that are [MONEY-2] aren't even affected by that. So your price would say the same way forward. Okay. Okay. Great. That sounds
Agent: Like all good things. And I definitely
EndUser: Will show this to [PERSON-1] and then we'll go from there.
Agent: Okay. Awesome.
Agent: Any other questions on this while I have the proposals pulled out?
Agent: No, I think that's all I had top of mind. All right. Awesome.

The customer wanted to know if they could include irregular advisors in the ""book me"" tab and calendar, and the representative responded by discussing calendar integration and email platforms. While the representative did eventually mention the possibility of getting a discount for adding more users, they could have initially spent more time understanding the customer's specific use case and needs regarding additional users and scheduling.

Additionally, the customer asked about the potential for billing changes over time, and the representative provided a general explanation about uplifts at renewal. The representative could have spent more time understanding the customer's concerns and specific situation regarding billing stability and potential cost increases.

Lastly, the customer mentioned that they would show the proposal to another person (presumably their boss or decision-maker), but the representative did not ask any questions about this individual or their role in the decision-making process.

Speaker 3: Yeah, like you saw their list of questions last time. Hoping there's not any more of that so we could get this.
Agent: Relationship to go right.
Agent: So yeah, if you could get to feedback [DATE-5], you know, because it's been in their hands for a while, right?

Agent: They want to make mention just so that we can give our legal team a heads up with the renewal of coming.
Agent: [PERSON-1]. Yeah.
Speaker 3: Yeah. Sorry. I had my muta.
Speaker 3: I was like, is that action?

Agent: Attend [DATE-5], but

Agent: Was that just kind of touching, you know, just fishing around for pricing?
Agent: Or is that something that's been talked about?

Speaker 2: <inaudible> flows and everything running automatically and all that kind of stuff.

This would help the sales representative tailor their pitch and provide more relevant information.
2. Budget: The customer mentioned that the cost of data management is a consideration. The sales representative could have asked about the customer's budget or their willingness to invest in data management. This would help the sales representative understand the customer's financial constraints and provide a more accurate quote.
3. Decision-making process: The customer mentioned that they are still exploring the cost-effectiveness of data management. The sales representative could have asked about the customer's decision-making process and who else is involved in the decision. This would help the sales representative understand the timeline and potential roadblocks.
4. Competitors: The sales representative did not ask about any competitors that the customer is considering. Understanding the competition would help the sales representative position their product more effectively and address any concerns the customer may have.

By asking more specific questions about the customer's needs, the sales representative could have provided more targeted information and increased the likelihood of closing the deal.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer seemed to feel that the seller's product has the potential to meet their needs, but they are still in the process of determining if it would be cost-effective for them at this time. They have had discussions and shown interest in understanding the benefits and cost of data management. However, they have not yet made a commitment to proceed."
video_04958_167_6qr3y000000ocZUAAY,"Agent: I'll share it in [ORG-1] after. So here's what the Enterprise license agreement looks like. So the rough numbers that you and I had spoken about was using say like 97 number of licenses on the ELA.
Agent: Just to give you some again, we have talked about this, but since the recording, you purchased 12 licenses on an ELA previously.
Speaker 2: Metrics,
Agent: Your current [DATE-1] active users is 43 or [DATE-2]. And then what happens on an ELA is you buy for the number of users of where you're at, but then once you exceed that license count, everything is free.
Agent: So that's the situation that we're in [DATE-3], is you purchased for 13, for example, that was your user account when you purchased. And you guys quickly exceeded that good faith estimate.
Agent: So everything you're getting right now is considered free, but especially with the incremental licenses that we've seen, that's why [PERSON-1] flagged it. So the pro of getting on an ELA is you get Unlimited growth.
Agent: The negative is that you might have to buy a few more licenses so that we can protect our interest on it as well.
Agent: Is that fair?
Agent: Does that make sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Compare that to the UELA and what the QELA does is that allows you to set a lower license count up front But then there's true ups if you go over that number Within [DATE-4] period So instead of using 85 for example, we might use 37 for that initial purchase But once you exceed 46 to say let's you get you get to 77 We send you a true up for that 26 license cost And then at [DATE-5], true up, your license count restarts at 65.
Agent: So it's just a matter if you want to build in some growth and then have that free growth beyond that, or if you don't want the shelfware. It's got it.
Speaker 2: So I think more likely than that, the [DATE-6] is what they're going to go for. I think I misspoke earlier and it's just said this straight, ELA. I think [DATE-6] would be more likely what they go for.
Speaker 2: As far as payment. So I know from the most part you pay for when you're upfront.
Agent: We don't have a situation where I get flagged by [LAW-1] because we'll just we'll do the true of instead and you'll only pay for what you need Rather so the ELA is really good when you're at 87 [DATE-3] You think at [DATE-7] you'll get 166 and we do 144 But that
Speaker 2: With when there's kind of this you know uncertainty in the air of growth And I think the QLA better supports what you're looking to do No, perfect.
Speaker 2: It makes no sense So I mean, if you want to send another meeting for maybe let's say [DATE-8] [TIME-1].
Agent: Definitely.
Speaker 2: Okay, perfect. It should via a meeting instead of us any email.
Agent: Be better for me. Obviously, to follow
Speaker 2: [DATE-8] [TIME-1] or round
Agent: Two, if that works for you. That's perfect. So I apologize. I'm actually off
Speaker 2: [DATE-8] [TIME-1].
Speaker 2: Can you do [DATE-9] [TIME-2]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll
Agent: Find something [DATE-9] [TIME-2]. I'll send it over and if that time doesn't work, just let me know. I guess a [DATE-9] [TIME-2] after [DATE-10]. [DATE-9] [TIME-2] after [DATE-10]. OK, perfect. I'll also I'll get to work on the quote.
Agent: I think it sounds ultimately going to look like.
Speaker 2: Like we're pretty aligned on what the quotes speak on [DATE-9], but I just want to make sure that we're ready to go so we could stick that 13th date.
Agent: I won't send it out yet until we [PRODUCT-1].
Speaker 2: Sounds like a plan. All right. Awesome, [PERSON-2].
Speaker 2: Anything else I can help with?
Speaker 2: No, no, that was to make sure, obviously, you got the deadline and you understand, like, be done before we start closing it.
Agent: I just wanted
Agent: Obviously, everything has to for [DATE-7]. Yeah. So I didn't want you to think it was all and going right and thinking. So I kind of get you an idea of what's going on. That's perfect.
Agent: And it's always really nice to have a timeline that isn't like there's actually a time that we're working against.
Speaker 2: [DATE-8]. You know, it's I appreciate that.
Agent: So
Speaker 2: And hopefully we'll be able",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer showed alignment with the seller regarding the quote and the proposed timeline for the deal. They also requested to schedule a follow-up meeting to continue discussing the agreement. The customer's willingness to proceed with another meeting and their engagement in the conversation indicates a positive sentiment towards the deal.

However, the customer did mention some uncertainty about growth, which might require further clarification or adjustments in the agreement. Overall, the customer seems open to continuing the discussion and moving forward with the deal.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Specifically, they asked the following questions:
- ""Does that make sense?""
- ""So it's just a matter if you want to build in some growth and then have that free growth beyond that, or if you don't want the shelfware. It's got it.""
- ""I'll send it over and if that time doesn't work, just let me know.""
- ""I'll get to work on the quote.""
- ""Anything else I can help with?""

These questions allowed the sales rep to better understand the customer's needs and preferences, and to move the sales process forward.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Yes, based on the transcript, the customer seems to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They mention that the Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) and the Quota Enterprise License Agreement (QLA) both have benefits that align with their needs, and they express a preference for the QLA. The customer also mentions that they are ""pretty aligned"" on the quote for the product, indicating a general agreement on the value and cost of the product.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer:

The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's situation and explaining the benefits and drawbacks of different licensing options. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. The customer mentioned that their boss is likely to go for the ""EA"" option, but the rep didn't ask for any more details about this option or why the customer's boss prefers it.
2. The rep mentioned the possibility of ""shelfware"" with the QELA option, but didn't ask if this is a concern for the customer or if there are any specific reasons why they might not want to have unused licenses.
3. The rep mentioned that the customer is expecting growth, but didn't ask for more details about the customer's growth projections or how they plan to use the seller's product in the future.

By asking more questions about these topics, the sales rep could have gained a better understanding of the customer's needs and tailored their pitch accordingly."

Bye bye.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"Based on the transcript, there are a few instances where the sales representative could have potentially done a better job articulating the value proposition of their company or product:

1. When discussing the implementation timeline, the representative mentioned that it would take another one to two months for the user to get used to the tool and that it would be practical to see sales results in one to one and a half years. While it's important to set realistic expectations, this timeline may not effectively highlight the immediate value that the product can provide.

2. The representative mentioned that the product offers sales, service, and marketing capabilities, and that it is an industry-recognized platform with industry-agnostic solutions. However, they could have provided specific examples or use cases to demonstrate how these capabilities can address the customer's pain points or improve their business processes.

3. The representative briefly mentioned that they have customized solutions for different industries, but they could have expanded on this by providing more details about how their product has helped similar organizations in the customer's industry.

4. The representative mentioned that they will share some material and customer success stories with the customer, but they could have done a better job of emphasizing the value that these stories can provide in demonstrating the product's effectiveness and relevance to the customer's needs.

Overall, the representative could have done a better job of connecting the product's features and capabilities to the customer's specific needs and pain points, and providing concrete examples of how the product can provide value in the short and long term.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Based on the transcript, it is unclear if the customer feels that the seller's product meets their needs. The customer did not express any direct sentiments regarding the product's ability to meet their needs. They did mention that they are currently implementing a different system, and the seller proposed a workshop post-implementation, suggesting that the customer may still be in the process of evaluating solutions.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales representative mentions the customer's investment in their current tool and the expected ROI and implementation timeline. However, they do not ask the customer about their specific goals or challenges with the current tool, which could have helped the sales representative better understand the customer's needs and position their product as a solution.

2. The sales representative mentions the capabilities of their product, such as integration and scalability, but does not ask the customer about their specific pain points or areas where they are looking to improve. Asking targeted questions about the customer's current processes and desired outcomes could have helped the sales representative tailor their pitch to the customer's needs.

3. The sales representative mentions the industry-specific solutions offered by their organization, but does not ask the customer about their specific industry or the unique challenges they face. Asking about the customer's industry and how their current tool is meeting (or not meeting) their needs could have helped the sales representative better position their product as a solution.

4. Towards the end of the call, the sales representative mentions the possibility of a workshop, but does not ask the customer about their availability or interest in scheduling one. Asking about the customer's schedule and willingness to participate in a workshop could have helped the sales representative take a concrete next step towards closing the deal.

5. The sales representative does not ask the customer about their decision-making process or who else needs to be involved in the decision. Understanding the customer's internal dynamics and decision-making criteria could have helped the sales representative better position their product and address any concerns or objections."

1. When the customer asked to just quote the price, the sales representative should have taken that moment to highlight the unique features and benefits of their product, instead of immediately moving to discuss the pricing.
2. When the customer expressed interest in the Commerce Platform, the sales representative could have provided more information about how this feature would specifically benefit the customer's organization, rather than just mentioning the cost.
3. Towards the end of the call, when the customer expressed concern about the potential savings in GPE-3, the sales representative could have addressed this concern by providing more details about how their product would help the customer achieve those savings.

In each of these instances, the sales representative missed opportunities to emphasize the value that their product could bring to the customer's organization, instead focusing on logistical details like pricing and contract length.

EndUser: Or it might take something from [GPE-2], whatever, might be needed. But from what I've seen,

EndUser: So, yes, sorry, I was not very much available [DATE-1]. So basically, with the slackability, it's all good. It has been approved. So I'm going to be sending you a PO shortly.
EndUser: I didn't know, but as I was away for [DATE-2]. But we have a office party [DATE-1]. So I would say the [ORG-1] is more likely [DATE-3], which problems with [ORG-2].
Speaker 2: Is some
EndUser: Because we need to purchase a connector, the problems most like we needed [ORG-3] because w e are checking them for compliance or we waiting for their software reports and stuff.
EndUser: So [ORG-4] e that's going to be all in place then you know but it's fine we can upgrade regardless o f this being ready or not. So that's fine as long as you expand the way

Speaker 2: Because it's a relatively simplistic switch, there's nothing aside from having the PO prepared, signing off from the order form, that will get processed on our end in time for that renewal Start Date in [DATE-4], and then that switch will happen.
Speaker 2: So the functionality that you'll require for compliance will just get switched on in time for that date. Oh, go work with [PERSON-4] to make sure that she is aware of that.
Speaker 2: Where are you off two for your party?
Speaker 2: I was just looking for
EndUser: The... Oh, we just haven't had any office, but it's like a day. It's nobody else. It's like in the [TIME-1] or so.

Speaker 2: It's always the way, isn't it?

EndUser: We just wanted to know what's happening with [GPE-2] because this would not be an option. We would have to take a different option. So we want to make sure if we have a compliance, we can also use it.
EndUser: That's the only thing. But then the assign so that the report should be arriving [DATE-1].
Speaker 2: So security is going to have a look through it and I think that should be a problem. Yeah, I'm sure that okay. Sign off if, if for any reason, very sensitive to your requirements.
EndUser: Is there another vendor that you would.
Speaker 2: No, we didn't look into anything
EndUser: Else, so I hope it's a game of... I think it will, it's not problematic.
Speaker 2: We just need for the compliance reasons, we just need to repeat it. Yeah, check the box. Yeah, yeah, okay. Well, fine. So I've prepared the exact executable order form.
Speaker 2: So once you have that [ORG-1] received, I'll share that with [PERSON-5]. Perfect. Any questions in the meantime,
EndUser: Let me know. Otherwise, I'm sure we'll be in touch over [DATE-5]. Yes, I'm sure we will.

EndUser: Yeah, we don't want to disrupt your [DATE-9], so no problem. I don't want the theater. So that's fine. So like, as I said, we could do the so that should be fine.
Speaker 2: Approval for this, [ORG-6].
EndUser: All right. I'm just going to share it. I'm just going to share it with him, so he's aware. And he gets the form. So he knows that he's all OK, because sometimes he's [GPE-3]-based.

Speaker 3: Because again, he has to go through [DATE-1] and build this.
Agent: You know, again, if you want me to summarize it, I can have my ad and summarize it again [DATE-1] from the talking points.
Agent: My only concern is not to show them features that they already know that only, and they only care about are the things that they're concerned about going to be possible within [ORG-1].

Agent: Either now or.
Agent: You know, as a face to i f they are great, then [ORG-2] e done and we're signing If they're not, they'r e gonna get pissed off an d they're gonna hang up an d they're gonna go to anothe r vendor .
Speaker 4: No, of course we get that and to those points I got like I said, I was watching it quite a bit [DATE-2]. Just to see if I can summarize something real quick for you.
Speaker 4: I know one of the biggest things that [PERSON-1] was bringing up was. The quoting and the estimating section with his reps on on site. It's a kitchen table.
Speaker 4: Process, this is something he wants to be seamless to where it is done very quickly. He's able to go through.
Speaker 4: Not like that, that horizontal scorecard and all have that three step manual process, but do everything right there at the kitchen table.
Speaker 4: Haven't ready for them to review and sign before they leave the site because he didn't want them to leave the site. before presenting the quote in the pricing because then obviously you can lose a deal there.
Speaker 4: So I know that was one of [PERSON-1]'s biggest issues.
Agent: Yeah, and that's
Speaker 4: Why [PERSON-2] is actually mentioned [DATE-2] because of that specific thing. [ORG-1] actually probably would be very relevant for them because it is going to help with streamlining that that specific process.
Speaker 4: And [PERSON-2], I don't know if you want to expand on that at all.
Agent: Yeah, no, I mean, I think we've kind of identified into your point, [PERSON-3]. out of the box, it's just not going to cut it for what they're really trying to do.
Agent: So think it's a [ORG-1] use case and it's just kind of, you know, with our Q4, we're just, [PERSON-4]'s just a little crunched on time, so we're moving as quick as we can to, you know, we'll get that watched and we'll get that overview, you know, or that demo talk track figured out quick.
Agent: Yeah, we definitely
Agent: Yeah, because if not like, you know, if we were to have gotten, if this was the meme with a client [DATE-1], and you guys said, Oh, yeah, I have much to video yet.
Agent: So I'm not really sure they would have hung up because that's what happened during the first meeting when we did the sales tech one, [ORG-3] tech call, and they were annoyed, right?
Agent: Because they were annoyed that, you know, we were doing the discovery question all over.
Agent: I've, and, you know, I'm not trying to be and ask about it, but [PERSON-5] knows that, you know, once my clients come in, they're already sold.
Agent: I, you know, we have a hundred person user account that's going into marketing class.
Agent: They never even had to do a meeting or discovery Like my clients come in and they're ready to sig n and they're moving forward I've already done the discovery I don't need another discovery meeting We've given the specific pain point s that's really all I want to target at the meeting I don't want to go over other bells and whistle s because they already know that it's a robust plan .
Agent: Am I kind of making sense on that?
Speaker 4: Yeah, of course. And I mean, like I said, we already filled out that evaluation. I sent over to you for a majority of what I was able to review.
Speaker 4: But if you are able to, I think that would definitely be helpful for a kale as well. If you can just highlight whatever pain points.
Agent: All right.
Speaker 4: Then let
Agent: Me wrap up this call. I'm going to call my admin right now, have her type it up. I'll get that on over to you. And then that way you guys can go from there.

2. The customer's preference for a seamless, quick, and on-site quoting and estimating process. The Agent could have asked more questions to understand the customer's current pain points with their existing process and how the seller's product could provide a better solution.
3. The customer's need for a demo that is tailored to their specific use case. The Agent mentioned that the out-of-the-box solution may not be sufficient, but they did not explore this issue further or discuss potential customizations or workarounds.

video_05488_167_6qr3y000000ofRoAAI,"Speaker 2: Thank you.
Agent: So, and it's not there's no like requisite with Sales Cloud where for every sales cause user you need a [ORG-1] license and it truly is based on who actually needs access to the features and functions that come with [ORG-2] contracts.
Speaker 2: And it's
Agent: Pretty straightforward in that regard, like typically how we outline who would need access.
Agent: Is any user that would need to author and negotiate contracts, users who would generate the document, edit it, or send it for signature?
Agent: Users who work on any of the obligations or pre-approved clause libraries or change them in any And then users who administer the contracts tool, if you just needed to see an output document, then you wouldn't need a license.
Speaker 2: Way.
Agent: You can have the document and it's generated tie back to the opportunity and you can just open up and see it.
Agent: But if you wanted to make wanted to see a certain field, if you wanted to edit a clause library, like that's what's going to designate, hey, you need a license provisioned.
Speaker 2: Any change, if you
Speaker 3: Okay, you'll see
Agent: More in depth obviously when we demo it, it'll give you a very clear idea, but that's how we provision our licenses.
Agent: So with that being said, if there's any guidance you can provide us on numbers of users that we should, you know, forecast when we put together pricing, you know, that would help us a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can look at the numbers a bit more when I get home and can actually like look at the active users in front of me.
Speaker 2: But I would say like off the bat, all of the folks we gave for the like, you know, power user and whatever the middle tier was those absolutely so maybe like. I don't know, maybe somewhere around 250. Okay.
Agent: Or
Speaker 2: Like 221, because there are definitely some folks with sales force licenses [DATE-1] that won't need access to that.
Speaker 2: So I think we need to do a bit of thinking of who those people are, but I would say, like, you know, off the top of my head, probably a little below the number, you know, the number they've given.
Agent: Okay. And so then, So all of those users, 154 or 217 of them, all of those fall into the categories of users who would need to offer negotiate contracts, edit them, open them, send them for signature.
Agent: Work on the clause just to make sure before we get that
Speaker 2: Where we administer number for pricing approval.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so like we ops teams, right?
Agent: Have our legal
Speaker 2: Who are going to be the ones the legal team will be doing like any of the authoring of the clauses, you know, the templates, anything like that.
Speaker 2: Ops team will be helping administrate that and then essentially anyone on the sale team offering contracts, proposals, whatever it may will be
Agent: Be. So that could be anyone across the sale team. Perfect.
Speaker 2: Okay, great. I feel good about that number then. I appreciate it. But I think there are some folks. Yeah, like we have some Implementation folks, right, who have sales force licenses right now, who won't need to do that.
Speaker 2: We have some like, you know, product specialists who don't often need to do that. So we could probably slim that number down because not every single
Agent: Person into else force is going to need the ability to do that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That see it that way as well, where it's a sense of your total users, rather than every single user.
Speaker 2: Makes sense. We typically
Agent: Basically, you broke in those departments between sales off legal and the sales team. They're actually documents and manipulating them.
Speaker 2: Creating the output
Agent: Yeah, the customer. Those three buckets are typical parties Yeah, thanks.
Speaker 2: That would need a license provision.
Agent: That's okay. Okay, well, that being said, it's honestly pretty short and sweet. That's all the information that that I have [DATE-1] and Just one clarification.
Speaker 2: You've given us good guidance.
Agent: Does I make sure should we go in with 241 or 125?
Speaker 2: Want to make sure I understand that correctly.
Speaker 2: Um, why don't if you're okay with it?
Speaker 2: Why don't when I get home?
Speaker 2: I can like actually look at what our number of users is [DATE-1] number.
Agent: And try to give you a more accurate Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is that okay?
Agent: If I can I get to?

The sales representative could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs in terms of identifying the specific users who would require access to the features and functions of the seller's product. While the customer did provide a rough estimate of the number of users, the sales representative could have probed further to get a clearer picture of the user categories and their specific requirements.

video_05505_167_6qr3y000000g2r1AAA,"Agent: So, okay, thanks for taking the time. Okay, so this is where we're at. First thing I need to update you on is [ORG-1].
Agent: So something that we didn't know, you know, you didn't really inform us and we just also just didn't know. You have more [ORG-1] users than [ORG-2] users.
Agent: Are you aware of that?
Speaker 2: Okay,
Agent: You have 411 Slack users. You have 286 call it CRM users. So what happens here is this [ORG-3] plus license, those 180 guys are gonna get [ORG-1], great, which is awesome.
Agent: But we can't just like leave the other 118 without [ORG-1]. So what we have to do is we have to do what's called a bridge license. So we have to license the other 123.
Agent: Without getting too far into it, the value of those 89 licenses on a discounted grid upgrade price is $[MONEY-1]. I looked at that and I said, guys, like, no.
Agent: So I'll talk about like what we can do there in a second, but essentially there is an option where I'm going to eat that cost on the core side so that you guys aren't touched, but there's some, you know, some stuff with that.
Speaker 2: There's
Agent: We'll get into that in a second. So I just want to make that very clear is that if you do move forward the [GPE-1]: Plus upgrade, you were going to see a third line on the sales horse contract that says slack. grid licenses 125 because I cannot leave those 114 without access to [ORG-1] and that other contract's going away.
Agent: So that's the first thing. Okay, so second question you had was around billing terms. I talked about how we have some discretionary funds that are expiring at [DATE-1].
Agent: So essentially went to deal desk, fought back and forth [DATE-2]. So there's basically two options.
Agent: Based on the spend, the option I presented to you on a one year, which was [DATE-3], the only way I can get you semi-annual billing is if you signed a [DATE-4] in which it would be [DATE-5] in [DATE-6], and then [DATE-7] in [DATE-8].
Agent: I don't know that you guys want to sign a [DATE-4] contract, so I don't want to even have the discussion, but I want to be upfront that they will only approve [DATE-5] if it's a [DATE-4] contract where you're going to [DATE-7] in [DATE-8].
Agent: Got that's up to you and I to kind of figure out, but I want to be clear.
Speaker 2: It. So
Agent: Any questions on that?
Agent: Pretty straightforward. Okay. Discretionary funds. So we have some discretionary funds, as I mentioned, [PERSON-1] has.
Agent: So on top of eating your [ORG-1] 23K cost, and with the discretionary funds, essentially, let me just get the exact number, it would be [DATE-9], I think is the exact number from 578.
Agent: If it gets like let me just pull it up. It's 5611.
Agent: But that contract would have to be signed by [DATE-10] [TIME-1]. And the Start Date on that has to be [DATE-11] or earlier because the discretionary funds.
Agent: On the other one, if you went with like the semi [DATE-7] or you just didn't sign, you just took the other price. That one would have a [DATE-12] start date.
Agent: And the reason for that transparently, they don't want to do the credit with the semi [DATE-7] blah blah.
Agent: So that's kind of your, I guess it's your, we have three options on [ORG-4], but it's really two we're talking about.
Agent: It's either you get a semi [DATE-7] on [DATE-6] and you do a two, it's about 73k incremental or [DATE-11] annual. And if you can make moves, we can give you 7250 price cut on that [DATE-14].
Speaker 2: Okay. With the slack, thank you for that. With the [ORG-1] comp, if you will.
Speaker 2: Sound opportunity?
Agent: Yeah, so what's going to happen, [PERSON-2], essentially, is I'm going in like a wizard, dropping your price on other SKUs to eat that.
Speaker 2: And I'm just
Agent: So like, just so you know, transparently, on one of the options, The way I had to do it is your [ORG-5] cost is actually going down to [MONEY-2]. It's like way lower than what it is now. Okay.
Agent: Because there's only so far we can go on discounting on like the UE plus you before I have to go to like seven levels of deal desk, which takes you off. You read us off.
Speaker 2: So it's
Agent: Just, it's just basically, as you said, like a game in math.
Agent: Yeah, and I can send you this in emails. You have it. I've been working on the paperwork just in case you do want to move forward.
Agent: I have it ready because I don't want to waste any time, but but that's what they came back with.
Speaker 2: Okay. Yeah, why don't you send to me. I got a jump. So why don't you do that and then we'll get that work working.
Agent: Okay, sounds good.
Speaker 2: Thank you.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did not raise any concerns or objections regarding the product's ability to meet their needs during the conversation.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales representative does a good job of addressing the customer's questions and concerns about the deal, including the billing terms and the use of discretionary funds. However, there are a few areas where the sales representative could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. The representative mentions the need for a ""bridge license"" to provide access to [ORG-1] for all users, but does not explain why this is necessary or how it will benefit the customer.
2. The representative discusses the option of signing a [DATE-4] contract for semi-annual billing, but does not explore the customer's preferences or concerns about this option.
3. The representative presents the customer with three options for using discretionary funds, but does not ask for the customer's input or try to understand their priorities.

In each of these cases, the representative could have asked more questions to better understand the customer's needs and concerns, and tailored their response accordingly. This would have helped to build a stronger relationship with the customer and increase the likelihood of closing the deal.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Based on the transcript, the customer's top concerns that could potentially prevent the deal from closing are:

1. The need for a bridge license to provide [ORG-1] access to the additional 118 users, which comes at an additional cost of $[MONEY-1].
2. The requirement of signing a [DATE-4] contract for semi-annual billing, which the customer might not be willing to do.
3. The need to sign the contract by [DATE-10] [TIME-1] and have a start date of [DATE-11] or earlier to utilize the discretionary funds.

These concerns revolve around additional costs, contract terms, and deadlines, which the customer might find unfavorable. However, the seller is working on addressing these concerns by adjusting prices and providing options."

Speaker 2: So, okay, so you have you have an old user that has been deactivated, but you can't see them on the user list.
Speaker 2: Is that correct?
EndUser: Exactly. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 2: Are you able to share your screen there?
EndUser: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Great. Thank you.
EndUser: Okay, moment please.
EndUser: Okay, are you seeing it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got screen there. Thank you.
EndUser: Okay, so if I just go into this users here, I used to be able to.
EndUser: See, so here I have all active users, that's grand.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And then I used to
EndUser: Be able to click all users. And then it would show everyone that was registered, even people that was not working here anymore.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And
EndUser: There was like a little checkbox showing which ones was like active or not. So then I could just click the box and like reactivate, stell and for example.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, I wonder how I was going out. I wonder how the permissions shifted.
Speaker 2: So are you the master and then the master user for [ORG-1]?
EndUser: I'm not sure. I didn't even know that there was a master admin.
Speaker 2: So what they do is sometimes they, when they set up the account, they need to, [ORG-2] need to have certain people with certain permission. So obviously they don't want everybody to be able to see everything.
Speaker 2: So perhaps that's just a permission on your account. So just looking at them now.
EndUser: We see here the way there's active. I'm looking at admin users and there's access. And then I could click on that or that. That's exactly how it used to be.
Speaker 2: Can you go back to go to permission sets, so under users permission sets on the far left?
Speaker 2: Can you go down to the stranthen below that?
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 2: Ok, so if you go back to your home, your basic home page straight away, so your original page. Perfect. And then.
Speaker 2: You hit cases over the far right, either the maybe the drop down first or yeah.
EndUser: Okay, and let's do a new case. Okay.
EndUser: So I'll just put all my <inaudible> in here.
Speaker 2: See if it accepts it there. There. Cheating.
EndUser: Well, this is what my thing's in. My name and all that.
Speaker 2: Service contracts. Cases, please move to [PERSON-1]. Maybe that's right. OK, ignore can do it for you.
EndUser: It. Sorry. Get off.
Speaker 2: I OK, so what I will do is. I'll now.
EndUser: Create this case for you Okay.
Speaker 2: I will log us. I'll send you the case number. You don't have to do anything. And one of the guys from the tech team will [DATE-1].
EndUser: Reach out to you, hopefully
Speaker 2: Well, on the other side, what I'll do is I'll muck around with permission sets and see if I can get a quick answer for you.
Speaker 2: So the two things I'll set the official support case up and they'll reach out. And while we're waiting for those guys, I think they're in the other [TIME-1] behind.
Speaker 2: While we're waiting for them to contact you, I'll see if I can fix this on my side as well.
EndUser: Well on a stay in touch with you during [DATE-2] . Yeah, okay, absolutely perfect. Thank you. I'm so sorry. I know this isn't really your job to be doing this. I just got a bit confused.
EndUser: So sorry that it's actually took an
Speaker 2: I thought I was asking, but I'm hour. [PERSON-2], I'm not. No, no, don't apologize at all. So that's why we're here. And like, I don't fix them.
Speaker 2: Like if I don't know immediately, which I rarely do, I just ask others find the right person. It's easier for me to find the right person to fix it then for you to find the right person.
Speaker 2: So there's no problem. And sometimes there sometimes things change.
Speaker 2: So you were able to see that and maybe a new version updated and they changed ou t So it can be confusing because it's difficult to navigate but u m leave that with me. I'll create the case.
Speaker 2: I'll muck around with permission sets on the back end. And if I take a sip, I'll give you a ring. If not, we'll stay in touch during Yeah, happy [DATE-3].
EndUser: [DATE-4]. Over email.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, [PERSON-3]. Super. I think we're [DATE-5].

However, there were a few areas where the sales rep could have potentially spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current use of the seller's product, such as how many users they have, how often they use the product, and what specific features they find most useful. This information could help the sales rep better understand the customer's pain points and identify potential upselling opportunities.
2. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's future plans for the seller's product, such as whether they plan to expand their use of the product or add new users. This information could help the sales rep identify potential opportunities for cross-selling or upselling.
3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's overall satisfaction with the seller's product and their willingness to recommend it to others. This information could help the sales rep identify potential advocates for the seller's product and gather valuable feedback that could be used to improve the product.

Agent: And there's also this [ORG-1] inbox app that we haven't seen.
Agent: So we're stuck in there. But yeah, that's annoying because that integration is in there. One of these items should be able to delete from here.
EndUser: My items. Yeah, there you go. So there we go. Beautiful. Okay. So let's close out of this and I started again.
Agent: What a mess.
EndUser: What I'm going to do is I'm going to do it from scratch again. Yeah. This guy.
Agent: Yeah, I'm looking at some I was looking at some documentation and says that in outlook on the web, find the icon in the toolbar on open emails and events which is what we're doing right now.

EndUser: Oh, sorry, it's the wrong. Hey, I need to put the right one.

Agent: Well, let's, uh, can we go back to the error real quick?
Agent: Hold on.
Agent: Can you close the error?
Agent: So let me read that. Oh, no, you're good.
Agent: If now we can always set up a different call, I can show this to my team just if they've seen this. Oh, and we can set up a different call to get through it. No biggie.
EndUser: We have time.
Agent: And yeah. One more time.
EndUser: This is still source. Yeah.
Agent: Oh, this works.
EndUser: I know we're trying to be safe and it's really good, but who it can do something. I
Agent: Know. OK, so it says the sign user is blocked because you're not a direct member of a group with access nor had access directly assigned by the [ORG-3]. OK, interesting. Yeah, I've never seen this.
Agent: Um, but good to know that we have this recorded.
Agent: I will though I was talking about my team just to see if that's seen this before and then we can always schedule a new call two for me to actually do the deep dive on the on the features.
Agent: Are you traveling by any chance clan because we can do it [DATE-1] too.
EndUser: We can do it [DATE-1]. [DATE-2] should be fine. I'm actually traveling [DATE-3], but I can imagine that's fine. Yeah, I'm traveling. I'm traveling [DATE-3] as well.

Agent: So how first of all, I'll check with my team to see if this is something that we can help with just in case, or maybe this is something that or perhaps this something behind the scenes would lack me.
Agent: Um, but I'll go check with my team to see if if, like what this, if they now. the before and then I'll send you an email with new times for us to actually go to the deep dive .
Agent: That works. Okay.
EndUser: That's it. Yeah. I mean, you can probably check with the team and get back to me with some dates and timings. And I can, I'm available [DATE-4]. Yeah. That should be fine.

Agent: But I first want to check my team to see if it's in this before. It looks like right now there's just this, just a recap for the team. Hello.
Agent: It looks like there's only like there's like a [ORG-1] inbox app. that I personally haven't seen and that might be blocking something when we're trying to put in the actual integration.
Agent: But besides that, we were able to go into [ORG-1] if you want to go back to your [ORG-1] real quick just to double check that we have everything on correctly.
Agent: We have the integration on, we have the inbox, yeah, we have that, we have the right permission, we have the pain, yeah. We have that. OK, and use remapping. Got it.

2. The seller could have asked more questions about the customer's current setup and challenges they are facing with the integration and inbox app. This would have provided valuable insights into the customer's needs and allowed the seller to offer more targeted assistance.

3. The seller could have explored the customer's interest in additional features or services related to the [ORG-1] product. This would have helped the seller identify potential upselling or cross-selling opportunities and provided more value to the customer.

4. The seller could have asked about the customer's experience with competitors' products and how they compare to the [ORG-1] product. This would have helped the seller understand the customer's decision-making process and address any concerns or objections they may have.

5. The seller could have asked about the customer's timeline for implementing the integration and inbox app, as well as any potential blockers or challenges they may face. This would have helped the seller better understand the customer's sense of urgency and provide more tailored assistance.

video_05642_167_6qr3y000000ochYAAQ,"Speaker 2: Yeah.
Agent: Thanks.
Speaker 2: I guess, um,
Agent: I guess, do you have any up though?
Agent: I guess I want to ask you, I guess with the Marketing Cloud now going and the Data Cloud going to was meant to go to [PERSON-1] [DATE-1].
Agent: Have you got an update on any of that?
Speaker 2: I got. Yeah. So yes, I have an update. We just had a session with friend, her availability is limited.
Speaker 2: At the moment, because she had it off to [GPE-1], but we just came from [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] and the team.
Speaker 2: So that was just sent through literally like [TIME-1] before this meeting sent through a slide deck that has all the details around the proposal, which will be going up, I think it's got to go, not just [PERSON-4], it's got to go to [PERSON-5] and then to prove for the approval because the op-expend I think sits in our budget in [ORG-1].
Speaker 2: So we've got a summary slide to do to add to the deck from a strategic perspective in terms of well.
Agent: Just
Speaker 2: The reason for the uplift in the cost is because we're uplifting the volume of comms we're sending to customers to improve the experience.
Speaker 2: We think that'll have benefits in relation to like [ORG-2] and incentive scheme but we also in addition think like not only is it the right thing to do but the more proactive comms we send to customers the less they should be calling us and the less we'll have to service those inbound calls.
Speaker 2: So There's just that strategic piece to overlay to justify the uplift. Sure. But yeah, once that's done, then I think I think we're good to go.
Agent: So that's got to go. So because I got told, [PERSON-6]'s mentioned to [PERSON-7], they had a conversation that it was going to go to [PERSON-4] [DATE-1] in [PERSON-8] [DATE-2].
Agent: So that's so it's now just going straight to [PERSON-4] and then up to [PERSON-5] proof.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yep.
Agent: So [PERSON-8] doesn't need to say it. That's good.
Speaker 2: [PERSON-4]'s fine with it though. They said [PERSON-4]'s all fine with it in relation side of the budget.
Agent: To the other Yeah,
Speaker 2: It's because the like the actual spend is split across multiple budgets. So that's why. Okay, so he's approved it for them.
Agent: When's it going?
Agent: When do you think that will go to [PERSON-5] through?
Agent: Um, Okay, because yeah, this is all like our costs and dual desk is all on signing.
Speaker 2: Probably [DATE-3].
Agent: Hi [DATE-4]. Right. Okay.
Agent: So I don't know, does [PERSON-2] told them that?
Speaker 2: Sorry.
Agent: Signing by, [PERSON-2] told them that's valid for [DATE-5] 13th, [DATE-6] the 13th, sorry.
Agent: [DATE-6] the 13th?
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure. I mean, it depends on people's availability. I haven't been across the conversations until just literally [DATE-2].
Agent: Yeah, that's all I've
Speaker 2: Asked you. Oh, sorry.
Agent: No, I was just saying, yeah, [PERSON-2] should be all over it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [PERSON-9]'s all over it. So she's the one who presented like the information, the summary to she said, [PERSON-10] is fine with his portion.
Agent: Us. She said,
Speaker 2: It's just this, yeah. So like, it's so frustrating the way that the budgeting process works around here. Finance, anyway, I'm not gonna get into details because you know how frustrating it is.
Speaker 2: But the spend across the whole deal that you put together is split across about, I don't know, it's like three different budgets, right?
Speaker 2: Because there's a digital services, there's a support contract with [ORG-3], there's the op-expend for the messages themselves, and then there's the op-expend for the licensing.
Speaker 2: So it's two EGMs, so it's [PERSON-9] and [PERSON-5], but it's also two different GMs as well. So that's why it's so difficult to kind of, to get it done. Sorry, not difficult, just time consuming.
Agent: Time consuming, Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I'll call for all these people.
Agent: Well, thank you, love.
Speaker 2: [PERSON-13] crossed. Well, it.
Agent: I appreciate Okay, I'm here.
Speaker 2: All good. I'll keep you up [DATE-2].
Agent: Will you look after yourself?
Speaker 2: I will, thank you. Yep, we've got our new Go Live day is for [DATE-7], [DATE-4] And then I think we're switching the button on [TIME-2] [DATE-6] [TIME-3], everything goes well with deployments.
Agent: Night. Yeah.
Agent: Provided
Speaker 2: So yeah, I'm kind of getting excited. I'm just waiting for that final confirmation on the code freeze. And I'll just wait to catch up on sleep until [DATE-8].
Agent: Yeah, well, I'll call you [DATE-9], love and check in on you So what do you work in the top?
Speaker 2: Before.
Agent: I think we're just, I've just taken [DATE-10] in between off.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm off from [DATE-9] is my first day on leave. And then I'm off for two and a bit [DATE-13].",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"Answer to this question is unclear. There are no explicit statements in the transcript indicating that the customer got excited about a specific feature or aspect of the seller's product. The customer does mention that they are ""getting excited"" for the Go Live day, but this excitement seems to be more generally related to the completion of the project rather than the seller's product specifically.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer:

1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's budgeting process. The customer mentioned that the budget for the seller's product is split across multiple budgets and it's time-consuming to get it done. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the specifics of this process to better anticipate any potential delays or issues.

2. The sales rep could have also spent more time understanding the customer's strategic perspective for the uplift in the cost. The customer mentioned that the uplift in volume of comms to customers will have benefits in relation to [ORG-2] and incentive scheme. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand what [ORG-2] is and how the seller's product fits into the customer's overall strategy.

3.
