video_19745_167_6qr3y000000g2VCAAY,"Agent: Some of the things you want to know about need to know about to make a successful [ORG-1] project also be great to understand where you guys are with it [DATE-1], what you're seeing, what your, you know, what you're trying to get done with the projects.
Agent: I mean, hard to give me a high level, which I think it's great. And, you know, so we'll share as much as possible as we can.
Agent: And if we have to take some takeaways afterwards to get you guys other stuff, we'll definitely do that too. And just so you guys know, for those of you who haven't met me, [PERSON-1].
Agent: I'm a smart
Agent: Yeah, I figured we'd do this. [PERSON-2], I am a services leader. I've been at [ORG-2] for [DATE-2]. The me ecosystem for about 10.
Agent: I got the chance to meet hard in [GPE-1] when they came out to our [ORG-3]. So it was great to have a chat to them. And then on my team, fabulous engagement director, [PERSON-3].
Agent: I'm ready to want to quickly introduce yourself, although I just called you fabulous. So you must be great.
Agent: Hopefully,
Agent: I do have some things, certifications that I can show up. But like, so yeah, thank you for the intro.
Agent: I'm based out of [GPE-2], being with [ORG-2] [DATE-3], plus I think now, been primarily on the scums and media, but also been hearing about it in a by, you know, Implementation success stories.
Agent: So definitely all this team is on a good path. I was excited to see what they are doing next, obviously. So, you know, here I come. I heard these questions and things I've done in other places.
Agent: So I'm happy to help. Thank you.
EndUser: Nice to meet you guys. So for context, I guess where we are right now and heartache agent, feel free to add more or keep me honest here.
EndUser: Where we are right now with our sales organization is of course we are intending for them to be more successful in their roles.
EndUser: But at the same time, we have multiple initiatives or trying to enact changes in the culture and in the process, the reps may fit it harder to focus. Like they don't know where to focus on.
EndUser: They don't know whether they should be looking at each of their deals or whether they should be doing self-gen, reaching out, call calling.
EndUser: You know, all of these metrics and factors and commits It feels like we want them to see these to have visibility on where they're lacking in terms of commits, pipeline, close rates, and all of that stuff.
EndUser: But at the same time, we want them to be able to have the ability to focus on the vital vital. Because we've seen the revenue intelligence. It provides a lot of insights for the reps.
EndUser: But at the same time, it's a lot.
EndUser: So what's the sweet spot?
EndUser: That's where we'd like to... I guess gain your thoughts, your opinions
Agent: On so that we can better leverage it for our sales .
Agent: Yeah, before we get into like solutioning and problem solving, I think if we can step back and give us a little bit view into what your sales team looks like, what they sell, what does their, you know, sort of data they looks like or what they're trying to do, like give us me, give me some insight on how they operate.
EndUser: I think that'll be helpful.
EndUser: Sure, sure.
EndUser: So how they operate is we have two sales teams, right?
EndUser: Like big buckets. First one is tapping in our current customers and selling them products like [ORG-4] products, C-cast products.
EndUser: And then the other big group, the AEs that we call them is hunting for new companies, prospects, whatever the channel motion is delivering, whatever the Marketing motion is delivering, that type of stuff.
EndUser: And of course, we're asking them to call call, to self-generate their own needs and their own pipeline So at the end of it all, it's becoming definitely more product focused As we pivot towards the strategy being more towards contact center we want our reps to embrace that culture of understanding the products as well as identifying the opportunities within their install base identifying the opportunities within their development .
EndUser: Territories and seeing where, you know, which companies need our products and to tap into tho se markets, adapting to those ICPs and selling to those.
EndUser: [PERSON-4], if you can add more, feel free t o. Yeah, I think I'm really bi g. piece of this is that we're going to we're definitely going to charge it.
EndUser: Transition our sales team from positioning one product, which traditionally, previously what we did was try to lead with that product, which is our unified communications software.
EndUser: Think about it as voice, just voice, and then from there, once we're in to that account, expand to them contact That industry is now a very saturated industry that we definitely want to lead with contact center and not just contact center, but our suite of partnered products or our technology partner ecosystem, which consists of many other vendors and products that we can help provide through our platform.
Agent: Center.
EndUser: So it's how do we identify the right products to sell to a customer and have more visibility.
EndUser: We haven't had great, like, and we're also hoping that this could help provide better insights into what products our customers currently have, as all of that has traditionally been done outside of [ORG-2].
EndUser: We would take our billing manager system and provide reports. Everything was all based on reports, very little visuals to the sales team on what our install
Agent: Base currently has as existing products. Two more questions.
Agent: Now I'm thinking it makes me really like if you're thinking about I'll just say any role right, or [GPE-3], coming into [DATE-4], what do they look this is what I'm going to
EndUser: At like, how do they know do, right?
EndUser: Is that a real estate?
EndUser: Yeah, so we break it down into a couple of different teams. We have three primary segment or segment line cuts. We call small business commercial enterprise. Small business is very transactional.
EndUser: They generally they take everything from a lead perspective and graduate it to opportunity and accounts. And they get those leads directly from our routing system, like through lead routing. And they also get inbound phone calls and other sources.
EndUser: They generally get those incoming volume as a lead object. And then for our commercial team, we have a commercial Enterprise team. We have a [ORG-5] team. where they convert those to opportunity.
EndUser: They qualify these leads, convert them to opportunities and transition it to our sellers.
EndUser: So most of our teams use reports and our sales teams use reports and dashboards to identify what are the net new leads that are, net new opportunities that are being transferred from the VDR to the sellers that they need an action on.
EndUser: We'll have dashboards saying that these sales assigned leads We call themselves a sign lead, but they're in our instance is an opportunity.
EndUser: We show them aging report, how many of those have next steps, and the statuses for them to progress it to what we call a sales qualified lead. And then from there at sales qualified generally used the forecast
Agent: Lead, it's entered pipeline, and they've module to manage that. That makes sense.
Agent: So let me ask you, would you adding something?
Agent: I thought I heard an audio question. So and I'm going to jump ahead in terms of if you want to think an ideal
EndUser: Future, what would you see change for these salespeople?
EndUser: How would they be more effective in your mind?
EndUser: I think that they need. Like we would hope to see a lot more coming from them and a lot more from them is activity within their pipeline. We have trouble measuring it [DATE-1].
EndUser: We use things like we have additional fields like [WORK_OF_ART-1] to help assist us along with last activity, but our last activity field is based off of tasks and activities created by these reps.
EndUser: But then that also includes future tasks. And some of these future tasks are [DATE-5] and years out.
EndUser: So an opportunity maybe in our pipeline to close within [DATE-6] or even within [DATE-7], when we're reviewing less activity, it may look like it was recently, it was touched, but it actually has a future date because generally our filters have been that you must have touched it within [DATE-8].
EndUser: So less activity greater than [DATE-8]. But then when we're reviewing this, it's the fact that they have a future activity [DATE-9]. So they may very well not have touched this opportunity.
EndUser: So we want to see, get more insights and visibility and push our sales managers to get consistent feedback and that know that these ops aren't dying on the vine. I think that's where we're at.
EndUser: We don't have that level of visibility. We want reps to be able to action and know that. they have opportunities out there that they're not currently managing or have talked to.
Agent: So that's an internal expectation, right, to drive revenue or get more in I think asking a different question, which is, I'm a seller.
EndUser: Operational insight.
Agent: They're all commissioned.
Agent: They have the same deal to do with, hopefully that's already in place, right?
Agent: Which means they're driven.
Agent: The question I'm asking is, if I'm the seller, do we have enough insight?
Agent: As to what are they saying, what are their pinpoints, what are they saying
EndUser: They're stopping them?
EndUser: So let me just
EndUser: Answer the question in between answers, right?
EndUser: So [DATE-1] what happened is Instead of [ORG-2], a lot of manual [ORG-6] sheets and everything goes out, which [PERSON-4] and his team here, [PRODUCT-1] and [ORG-7] was not able to move and throwing a look at dashboard.
EndUser: They maintain it for sending that sales performance card, for example, for sending them top deals that what they have. They are in [ORG-2]. Everything is in [ORG-2]. That's how they try to manage it.
EndUser: In the future,
EndUser: What we are looking for is to leverage this insight and as a dashboard, it can be managed in a way that what [PERSON-5] is doing. It's easy for a wrap and E-trend team to talk to the
EndUser: Seller and the manager, respecting how to manage their business. Go ahead. Sorry. So I think that was just reiterating what I said previously, but to, like I think, understanding our question is that their pain points.
EndUser: In terms of selling, we collect through, like, I don't know if this is answering it, but we do collect the data in terms of lost reason.
EndUser: Why do we lose a customer?
EndUser: Are you trying to see, like, the sellers pain point within internally within our space?
Agent: Or, was your question more externally?
Agent: What are they facing?
Agent: No, I think it's more internal. So, fine.
Agent: In coming back to, I think we kind of touched it, but we didn't really double click into it, right?
Agent: So I'm a seller, I log in [DATE-1].
Agent: Are they looking at [ORG-2] screen day one?
Agent: And then you're like, okay, let me process through this.
EndUser: Oh, I got a list of opportunities how do they get, do we know have like enough?
Agent: I'm working on.
EndUser: Like So what they do on a daily, at least for most of them, and this is an issue too, is that we don't believe all of our sellers are using the same methodologies and how they run their [ORG-2].
EndUser: But most of them are using tasks and activities to manage [DATE-10], so their [DATE-9] tasks. And then on top of that, we have a specific field called [WORK_OF_ART-1], so everyone looks
Agent: At their next steps and when that's due to follow up. Let me ask you differently. So there's a new business, then there is existing business. And business that's right of luck I need to save.
Agent: So if it's new business, how do leads is the way to now?
Agent: The question that I would ask is, if they know these are the leads, how many leads does one self-serve get?
Agent: Let's double click into that sort of format.
Agent: Into understanding, are they overwhelmed?
Agent: Or are they even so
EndUser: Vulnerable, so negligent, they're not even looking at that list?
EndUser: I don't think that they are actually pulling up, I'm thinking [PERSON-6] model is one way to look at this.
Agent: So they're saying that they're not even looking at the leads, right?
Agent: So how do they know like I need to go after this customer is like the manager tells them, hey, here's a new account, you should go look at person this business, like how do they engage?
Agent: Or is it like, hey, your new product,
EndUser: Go sell it to all your, these list of customers that you have in the directory?
EndUser: I would say it's a combination of multiple factors and currently it, the company's challenges.
EndUser: It borders more on lack of volume for our... run rate reps for the smaller size smaller spaces, right?
EndUser: And for our Enterprise reps, the ones on the bigger higher spaces, I'd say the challenge is more on the strategic side in the sense that there's not enough self-generation of leads or of pipeline.
EndUser: There's a lot of dependency on the Marketing slash channel motion, right?
EndUser: So that's where we want to enact changes or proceed. with the initiatives that won for our smaller spaces reps .
EndUser: They are faced with a challenge of lack of volume, but their goal is are still going up, right?
EndUser: And they're still expected to generate more revenue.
EndUser: So how do they get clarity on what needs to be fixed?
EndUser: And this is alluding to what [PERSON-4] mentioned about the activity. We want to be able to show them the expectations when it comes to the activities.
EndUser: Like for example, how many calls should they be making?
EndUser: How many notes should they be taking?
EndUser: Or just to improve the quality. And so that will translate. to hopefully better close rates, better conversion, higher average deal sizes, and [ORG-8] y more revenue. That's for the smaller size, a smaller space.
EndUser: For the bigger space, you know self-gen is one. I'd also allude to tapping more into the product mix. Again, with what [PERSON-7] mentioned about us pivoting towards the [LOC-1], the focus on that product .
EndUser: We want our reps to invest more time.
EndUser: And also to have that awareness and have that visibility dashboard or sales force as they start [DATE-13], to have that awareness and visibility that hey they need to perform more in these new products that the company is wanting to strategize on or to style more on and that's where the opportunity is in those bigger segments.
EndUser: That's how I would frame it and possibly the reps are not aware of it even that those are the challenges some of them may be.
EndUser: Face, but then if we put them there on the table and they see it, right, every day they see it o n the leaderboards and things of that nature, the pipeline and deals, they may
EndUser: Develop that muscl e
Agent: To really focus on the activity metrics, on the product metrics, on the strategy to better you know, their metrics . So I want to use the time was, you know,
EndUser: How much time you still have, sorry.
EndUser: Want to make sure that we get to some direction as to where we're going next, right?
EndUser: That's something else you want to add and I can hear with. Yeah, I'll say one more thing.
EndUser: So in the Enterprise space, they as they don't have a lot of opportunities, but they will go after is the close date that they expect an opportunity to come in.
EndUser: And that's they'll prioritize if there's an impending event for the customer, such as there's a need to like for a budget to be spent or for an upgrade in other products or services that they need that would go tie closely to our products and services as well,
Agent: Or an expiration of a contract. So, I think that related to a question that you asked. It makes sense. So just to summarize, I think playing it back. Well, what I heard is there's different market segments.
Agent: There's also different flow in terms of how the lead comes in through all these different personas, but like [ORG-5] has a different flow versus your sales rep versus an [ORG-9] based on the type of accounts they're dealing with.
Agent: So that's that. So you have to keep in mind there's different journeys, if you will, for each of them.
Agent: And then each of them is going to have a different grouping so far?
EndUser: Of metrics you're looking at.
EndUser: Do you guys agree
Agent: I'm on the right track. Yeah. That's it.
Agent: So now pairing it back, I know we started with revenue intelligence, it does what it does, right?
Agent: It can be, so basically Grounding up, like, revenue intelligence, a pre-built product, has a pre-baked visualizations that you're seeing right now in the product. And it was meant for, a set of journey, right, manifested into that end result.
EndUser: If you think about a set of personas,
Agent: It does really great when you do that.
Agent: When you have a situation where Which is what I'm hearing right like when I track activities you want to track very specific components Those right now you're not going to find because this is a pre-baked solution, right?
Agent: It's it's meant to work with out of what components like opportunities But then when you start going like standard activities, okay But if you have any customizations beyond that you want to track where which is where you to start customizing the The analytics view if you're all let me pause there.
Agent: Is that making sense?
Agent: It doesn't make sense.
Agent: So my question is then, is that part already manifested?
Agent: Like, is the team thinking out that?
Agent: And then, hey, we're already going to go down this path and building this?
Agent: Or are you still thinking, I don't know if that's the right direction.
EndUser: I'm trying to figure out where the blockage is, if you will. For now, I would say that we want to establish a baseline, even the [PERSON-8] dashboards that we have with the suite.
EndUser: And then once we establish that baseline, I can imagine that there will be appetite for further metrics, for further focus areas, like the activity metrics. That's not included in the [PERSON-8], but eventually we'd like to include those.
EndUser: So having that in mind, we want the baseline to be informative, but not too [ORG-10], if that makes sense, not too much noise for the reps and for the managers using it.
EndUser: While also having the, I would say, allow once for future state, like having that at the back of our heads, that there will be additional metrics in the future.
Agent: Once we install those or once we implement those, it still won't be cluttery for the reps and the managers. That totally makes sense.
Agent: I think in which I started breaking it down into those chunks of personas and the journeys, because then it's clear, let's just say, the user experience best practices, you don't want to have more than, let's say, four components on a homepage.
Agent: I'm making it up right now, but bear with me.
Agent: What that does is it simplifies your pace of where the page they land and they look at, because if you over clutter, we've seen customers do that, they'll put in like 21 components The customer that was working with X-ray did that They put in every in a permutation combination They want to do that And you can ask like [PERSON-9], if he comes to a home page with 14 components we know what to do next, right Because he does this in [DATE-9] now And I can tell you most sellers, they get overwhelmed Most sellers, they have a mindset They want to close the deal .
Agent: Okay, they like there's something they're looking at. They want to close it. They're all excited to do it. But if you start throwing in all these little things in between, you're actually slowing them down and their process.
Agent: So what you want to do is keep it simple and design it with a tailor to the, you know, those individual and neutral groups, if you will. We've done that. We know how to do it.
Agent: I mean, pause there. But obviously this meeting, you're looking for something beyond that. So let me ask you back. How gardens can we help
Agent: What specific you at that will help you. Let's say, take it to the next.
Agent: Well, I was thinking, yeah, if you one thing I'm a really quick, let's start with, because I think we want to start the juices flowing about things that you might have questions about because what you're acting for sound similar to what.
Agent: [PERSON-10] worked on with the project, right?
Agent: It's slightly maybe enhanced use case around more or less identifying campaign that the sales reps would be working on them and ensuring that their opportunities are funneled and supported in that direction.
Agent: But, you know, generally what you're talking about is very similar.
Agent: [PERSON-10], do you want to take like [TIME-1] and just talk about some of the pitfalls that you saw from the things that... that you feel people need to be ready with that when you're doing something that's, you know cross the business, what impacts it can have Maybe we start there with the other things that we've seen And then, you know, Hard-Ape, others come with like where you are and what you really , want to focus help on.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Agent: I also want to tailor the pick-for question.
Agent: Is this tailored from a business perspective?
Agent: If you can give me more dimensions, I could be a little bit more specific than because I've never picked for
Agent: Us all over the place. Well, sure. Every project has good pencils. But I think from a technical perspective, I think what is it that's going to stand in the way of them
Agent: Getting the thump and running?
Agent: Yeah, I still want to bring in a simple framework, which is people process technology. We ran into that if you're executing so I'm describing the problem being, hey, we want to implement the solution.
Agent: We want to build on this build this metrics and components and take it. And roll it out to the customer. So that's the definition. And so for that, I would start by saying number one for us.
Agent: I think the, you know, even though we know [ORG-2]. I want to start evaluating making sure you have the right licensing and. look at the right structure in plac e before we even take the next step .
Agent: The second, I would say, is making sure that you can write configuration for that next step. So if you're looking at a future state, there's specific things like revenue intelligence.
Agent: If you already know you already implementing or implemented, there is dependencies on that. I want to make sure that those are counted for. In this case, we'll be collaborating forecasting as a hard core dependency.
Agent: So make sure that's a counter for you confirmed. It's working well. You don't want to implement it just for the sake of implementing because. collaborative forecasting could be a project by itself.
Agent: So those are like, let me pause here because I'm going to go like a train. So let me pause here and get feedback.
Agent: Is this the right direction?
Agent: And feedback from
EndUser: 23 by 16?
EndUser: I think I like the idea where [PERSON-3] was going, right?
EndUser: Because think about it from our perspective.
EndUser: What we know, we know, right?
EndUser: From from relevant diligence perspective how the dashboard looks like.
EndUser: Why where we are where we want some more guidances and development, yeah, we can think about it, but from the business ideas perspective, that's how effectively the questions that you were asking that when the seller comes in, what they should look for, right?
EndUser: How it should be displayed on the dashboard, how that day should get started.
EndUser: That's something that what we are looking for, how we have built for your customer, and that if we can show us, right, that this is how a seller day when they log into [ORG-2] looks like, right?
EndUser: This is how managed just these looks like . are information that is good for them to se e the dial Code space . think that would be a good starting point for [ORG-9] to look into it .
EndUser: Then we can talk about technical thing s is
Agent: That , how that can be fillable in the revenue industry. I think that makes sense. And again, I'm going to reset here, [PERSON-3].
Agent: So again, when you're asking, short answer, we can't show our customers' data, so that I can talk you through what we did.
Agent: So let's start out reset in terms of the before and after for the customer, right?
Agent: Because your journey could be different than their journey. So for this one customer that we did, they actually had a lot of different dashboard components. The question you were asking is, hey, you don't.
Agent: The stuff you're trying to take is to build something like that . where we were coming to them, they already had that. They already had like 11 components. I wasn't making it up. That part is real.
Agent: They actually, when the server logs in, they have a home page. They spend [DATE-9] implementing this project already before we join.
Agent: Where they had these 19 components with all the different metrics, how many opportunities, how many leads that are coming in, how fast they're moving. They also had an activity channel to track how many activities they're doing.
Agent: When I was sharing that insight to you, which was overwhelming for them.
Agent: One of the things that we did, and this is why I was talking about the project journey, when we got in, not only technical, but those are people side of things where we interviewed and didn't discover with them, we actually asked the same exact questions I was asking you.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Hey, what's happening?
Agent: What's your pain points?
Agent: Tell us more.
Agent: And so they were actuall y gave us a lot of raw feedback that I don't know why it was not circular, but it came to us And so our insight from that was they actually hated this dashboard.
Agent: So what ended up happening [PERSON-9] s instead of using [ORG-2] for logging opportunities and working through that the reality was they would go to LinkedIn and they would pull in LinkedIn contacts for the account s they're working on, and they would just call them directly.
Agent: So there was n o interface with the sales process or the system they were usin g. And they were jumping straight from other too l. And the only time they would come into [GPE-4] is because their manager asked, he y, you have an updated opportunit y.
Agent: So they would come in [DATE-11] once or [ORG-13], and then it will update make update s. So let me pause here just to make [PERSON-13] re that we calculated the before pictur e.
EndUser: And I will talk you to the after pictur e. Does that make sens e?
EndUser: It makes a new work only talking with the contact perspective, not from need forecast or anything.
Agent: Your focus was on contact right now. I was saying contact. What I'm saying is they're not even coming to the system to do any forecasting.
EndUser: Like to do forecasting,
Agent: You have to come in the opportunity and make an update on the stage. What I'm saying is they were not even dealing with it.
Agent: What they were what was happening was because of the analytics that they had in place, which was 11 components or widgets. That's on the home page. They were so overwhelmed with that.
EndUser: They didn't want to do it. Touch the system.
Agent: So jumping ahead. So when we came in, that was feedback. We looked at it, we asked the same thing we discovered.
Agent: This is a provocative thought, which was what do you really need?
Agent: So, what it came down for, I think it was mentioned early in the conversation, our conversation, where you called out, they really want to know what to focus on.
Agent: If I have a new product I want to push, what do you want as an executive is then to focus on that new product that they want to sell more.
Agent: If it is about, hey, they got let's say 10 accounts, like commercials might have more accounts, right?
Agent: And so when they're doing that, you want to focus, let's say these three ones [DATE-11]. How do you tell them that without having to
EndUser: Just communicate through an email or text?
EndUser: Is that making sense?
EndUser: Like the format of?
EndUser: Yeah, it makes sense. so So yeah, we have no way of doing that [DATE-1]. And that's one of the ways that we're trying to do that is survey the sales managers, hey, what are your
Agent: Top deals for [DATE-11] with high propensity and it's literally just surveying them. So we went after that problem.
Agent: It was a hard problem to solve because you can tell you the existing tool back to your point about [ORG-9] is not going to do that.
Agent: There is some functionality you can leverage, but it wasn't going to solve this nugget that I'm talking about.
Agent: So what we looked at very specifically was the [PERSON-9] or the [PRODUCT-2] features within the platform to help us with that. So let me pause on that.
Agent: Let me ask you, have you guys thought about that before I go down this track of saying this is how we solved it?
EndUser: You guys are there yet?
EndUser: Like the ovens, [PERSON-9], are you guys looking at lead scoring, opportunity scoring?
EndUser: Yes, like we're looking to implement that a lot of this is still in staging. So it's not putting out great data for us to really look at. We're looking to move that to production now.
EndUser: And like, for example, one of the primary things that I'm trying to even look at or understand is that in staging one of the dashboards for. I'm trying to find it. I was looking at.
EndUser: Was trying to help us, uh, our commit calculator. For example, it goes to step one, step two, step three of removing your. current deals. Like, I think that uses some [PRODUCT-2] behind it to show up, like
Agent: Why it shows these five deals to remove. But without that being in production, it doesn't mean too much less.
Agent: So I want to come back to what [ORG-11] asked initially, right?
Agent: Like, hey, what was the format?
Agent: What would we change?
Agent: So one was it wasn't as much about the dashboard components as to can you measure this metric?
Agent: Can you measure number of activities?
Agent: And you know, like if that matters.
Agent: We actually took a step back from that and we went after let's focus on answering this harder question Which is let's which deals to focus on because once you get that clear the rest of the started steps are manifesting already Right, so for example If you'll if you already give them a short list of saying hey, here's five opportunities you're gonna focus on [DATE-11] Okay, we'll come back to like the calculation of it, but just imagine if you have 23 approaches sitting there, you're actually focusing on non- or whatever comes to mind first.
Agent: Instead, the system with his [PRODUCT-2] engine was able to tell it, you're going to focus the end is tailored to every seller.
Agent: So it's not in for opportunities, obviously, across all the sellers, right?
Agent: In every individual getting that short list of opportunities, short list of contacts, short list of leads, they were all getting that.
Agent: And tailored to that view for opportunity view, there's a different component which says, OK, here's what is happening in this opportunity.
Agent: If you click that, you're going to get this widget, if you will, that shows you the specific details about that opportunity. So that's what we started doing more.
Agent: So it's a very different ask than what you were saying, thinking about, which is why I'm saying this is a more provocative thinking, is to, and more like an exponential, if you will, right?
Agent: It's not the same thing of just repeating an analytics view.
Agent: It's basically taking one step further, saying, hold on, how can we make sure that it's targeted to the right data to work?
Agent: Them . Let me pause here. I know it's a very different thought than what you were probably asking or thinking
EndUser: Is this making sense think you want to hear more?
EndUser: Are you feel like no?
EndUser: I need to go back to the component view Yeah, I think for me it does make sense.
EndUser: We did try to do something similar by just creating an [ORG-11] a deal customer profile Score and implementing that in our database and scoring it so that we can have Sort of a ranking system of what customers a person should go for based on and that would have product propensity in their or product specific scores to their as well.
EndUser: So completely makes sense. We but at the same time, I feel like we do need to move fast on this and how is it
Agent: That we could move forward with this and help identifying these opportunities. I'm going to pause here because I don't understand moving
Agent: Fast means [PERSON-3], are you familiar with what means moving faster than?
Agent: No, we're just
Agent: Double clicking.
Agent: I'm. You know, you have some more time. Yeah, and also I think you were asking about like the analytics component for you and I know it's equal to a different tangent.
EndUser: Did that answer your question how we solve the problem or what we looked for?
Agent: Or give you a direction of
EndUser: What was the real problem was?
EndUser: Yeah, meaning what is the answer right from the [ORG-11] scoring that we have attempted right?
EndUser: I believe that more of the thing that what we are looking for was original thing that [PERSON-11] used started talking right. What does again I'm going back to the same repeating the same thing.
EndUser: What does the sales rep been in [TIME-2] when the login results for what they see?
EndUser: Right what they see actually that is something the view that what we are more interested into so that when they log in they see okay how many leads I have what's my commitment for [DATE-1] where I stand from the forecasting standpoint of you what my top opportunities are what my top codes are or what leads are right and where I stand with my I understand activities and task and what I need to do.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: So those kind of sales flow how a seller will visualize his day or her day before starting the job. That's what we are more interested into right now so that we can start working towards it.
EndUser: [DATE-14], we don't have that as a twin mention. We have it, but we don't have it kind of scenario.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: It's everybody can do whatever they want. We want to standardize that across the board for a seller for a manager and I just see our level.
EndUser: So that everybody can see and everybody can talk the same language as the as the day starts as [DATE-11].
EndUser: And that's where we are struggling, okay?
EndUser: Well, we can harness to you and that's why this intelligence equipment temperature the insights the sales change around is all the different dashboards that what you guys have helps us a lot. But again, we have six different dashboards.
Agent: It doesn't give us a synchronizing or summary view of all those trends together. Yeah, I think I answered the question about it. Take a start again.
Agent: So the page the sales agent locks into is a home page that's customized for them. It has a custom component on [DATE-14]. has different tabs on that one component.
Agent: So you can go through it or you rotate like a cycle, like an accordion. You click on the first one, it shows your leads. The second one, you go to opportunities, third so it's
EndUser: One goes to contacts, tailored in that each tab. Sorry, sorry. Yeah. You have some kind of visualization diagram.
EndUser: I'm not looking for actual customer view, but some kind of visuals in diagram that what we can see, right?
EndUser: And we can relate what you are talking for.
EndUser: So, right?
EndUser: It's very difficult for us to, for me, to see and relate, okay, that what you are talking about. I understand what you're telling,
Agent: Are kind of a box view, each and everything, right?
Agent: But again, just if [PERSON-11] and so... I hear you and I...
Agent: I probably said in the beginning I can't share the customer data I don't have a view that's prepared for this . This meeting, we can try to come back.
Agent: Yeah, well, you know what, our, we'll take it back and we'll share whatever we can and get you.
Agent: Visualizations that you know, remove the customer and things like that if we if we've got them available to us Obviously the same way a data with other people We can't share other customers But
EndUser: We don't want to share a by
EndUser: But wherever we can do that we will definitely do Because what we do [DATE-1] and I will show you a little bit right glimpse of it that how we are trying to do Interesting I need to share a cool tab.
EndUser: Sorry.
EndUser: I'm trying to figure out which is that that?
EndUser: Some
EndUser: So, what we then this is the stage environment, yes, second before it comes in, this is the stage environment, right, okay, which actually comes in.
EndUser: And if you see, right, we are trying to build this like all the dashboards, okay, here, just to make sure that everybody has the dashboard view of same revenue inside, so everything.
EndUser: What we are trying to focus is what [PERSON-14] you started and what [PERSON-4] was leading towards is how can I have instead of scrolling down here and there on all the different dashboards and all those things, right Okay, how can I have a simple screen at the home page where the top things that they can look into ?
EndUser: So that's the first, first thing that what we are trying to figure it out. And the view could be from sales perspective and for the manager perspective, they could be different. That's fine. Okay.
EndUser: But that's what we are, we are going towards.
EndUser: And then trying to go with the [PERSON-9] analytics view that what I'm all you were talking about is how the product insights comes in, right?
EndUser: How the different area of, of activity talk comes in. But. To go there, we need to start from somewhere and show leaders that this is what they will look when they open the dashboard up.
EndUser: And that's where I right now we are struggling and there's a lot of white space over here if you see.
Agent: It looks all over the place, all over the map.
EndUser: Yeah, give you [TIME-3]. Let me see if I can find something.
EndUser: Oh, it makes sense right?
EndUser: I'm up to you and [PERSON-3] both where we are [DATE-1] and where we want to go.
Agent: No, I get the, well, it's too far as part a part B, right?
Agent: So one is sharing what we've done or similar things, right?
Agent: So finding a mark, I think that's reasonable ask. I was just not prepared for it.
EndUser: So no problem. That's it. That's the first thing.
EndUser: As we are trying to move this into production, now I'm trying to build the dashboards, and try to show the value and the insights to sellers and the manager whom we are going to pivot as a [ORG-14].
EndUser: We want to be able to make sure that they understand what they train and they understand what they are looking for.
Agent: Yeah. I want to take a pause. Yeah, We
Agent: That makes sense. did a slightly more. the spoke solution for the customer that I'm or I work for.
Agent: And when he's talking about it, the solution we did was effectively layered a number of dashboards on top of each other so that when you clicked on one, you got different data, you got different looking seal.
Agent: Obviously, that was more, there was some Code to drive that. So we didn't have dashboards that flowed underneath.
Agent: We had them all in place, but, You know, the key for us was the, which looked very nice, but the key for us, and I think the unique selling point was the next best action for the seller.
Agent: So when you came in, it wasn't just your dashboard that, you know, [PERSON-9] has and I have an arm or have it's, it's sent things to me and it's specific to the direction that I end up the action that I need to take.
Agent: And then it's also at the opportunity level. So that's— The big . That's the big shift from just a straight up dashboard, you know, and having a nice dashboard that looks good. It felt great. Love a good dashboard.
Agent: But it's that insight that says you need to take this action that really changed the mark.
EndUser: Absolutely mark. And that is where that's kind of dashboard view that what we are trying to look for so that they understand what next action has to be taken.
EndUser: And when [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-11] talk to the sales leader, they can talk about individual and the manager level that is this action taken or not or where we are.
Agent: Yeah, for some.
Agent: Exactly.
Agent: I tried to solve for you, [PERSON-14]. I tried to solve. Thank you. Thank you. You did, actually. Yeah, but this is what I was talking to. I get the part. Again, I'm conceptualizing for this meeting.
Agent: And then we'll come back with the visual part. So we'll follow up.
EndUser: Maybe it's just an email. Maybe it's not a meeting. No, no, anything.
EndUser: Because what helps us is also, right?
EndUser: Not only. So, let me, what we are trying to do is, we are trying to establish a practice which is not that great here in it by [DATE-1].
EndUser: And if we are trying to do it with the pilot users we want to do in a way that we can give them more insights to take the next steps and they are happy for it, right?
EndUser: They know what they exactly need to do. And that's why we are taking a slow approach for [DATE-11]. We want to make sure that we do for certain groups, not for everyone.
EndUser: And once [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-11] and [GPE-5] was not on a call, who's the email obstinate under [PERSON-19], once they all understand, right, then we can expand that to the broader organization.
EndUser: Because it's a first step or you can say the first era of Revenue Intelligence or the way doing the business for sales [DATE-1] in [ORG-2].
Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, we'll come back to you on the output. I think the only thing I'll say is We had like two layouts. One was like this main home page layout.
Agent: I think [PERSON-3] just the next best action comes in.
EndUser: Talked about, hey, where
Agent: I was explaining like there's a header where that this is the top.
Agent: So this is what I was trying to explain, right?
Agent: Like which is the top part, what you see in the screen right at the very beginning. I you had to scroll down to see a couple of things.
EndUser: Don't know if you notice, Yeah.
Agent: It reduced a lot of that. That's where I was going. So when you pull up the very first that has a lot of white space.
EndUser: Section,
Agent: So every design. fine . Like literally like, almost think about like pixel by pixel design and tailored them so that they can see all of those things in that one space. And at a given moment,
EndUser: They're looking at, hey, here's five things and it'll look at. That was the ask that's why we boil it down to. And anything more than five is not showing up on the screen.
EndUser: And that's something that [PERSON-23] is also a team. Thanks for joining. And that's something that we are looking from the guidance perspective.
EndUser: We have our own parts that what top five or six things that we should look from the dashboard standpoint of you.
Agent: But again, when we start to putting in, you sort of scrollings, right?
Agent: So we want to avoid those kind how elegantly we put in over there.
EndUser: Of scrollings and see
Agent: Yeah, but I think what I'm double clicking into is two things. One is not just the layout, which is what I think you're asking.
Agent: I'm saying there's something else, which is there's also prioritization of each transaction on what they show in those five things. So there was an engine that was built.
Agent: Which was based on [PRODUCT-2], so scoring is one, but there's also customization that was done to say, what are the calculations, what are the variables to be considered
EndUser: For per transaction that makes [DATE-19] to be in their five items for every person?
Agent: The cut
EndUser: Correct.
EndUser: And when you say about the engine, right?
Agent: Is engine, um, outside, sitting platform or is customizable engine or, or it is within [ORG-2].
EndUser: Outside of frame intelligence
Agent: Well, it was a broad term. It was customized for me life. Right. Like it's, yeah. So yeah, it was, uh, it was, uh, on platform. And it's nothing to do with.
Agent: So this is why I think we confuse ourselves. [ORG-9] has a play and it sits and does its thing. What I'm seeing is it's a customization you do on the core. that allows you to do that first.
Agent: So Reverend Intelligence is like on the stack what we call a [ORG-11] analytics, right?
Agent: What kind of CRM?
Agent: So it's a separate thing on its own. I'm not even talking about that. I'm talking about, think about the homepage on the core platform.
Agent: When they log in, what do they look at?
Agent: You can bring in some of the components from revenue intelligence, but that's not the entire story.
Agent: The story is you actually start thinking about the core, where they go for opportunities, the log in, and how do you rebuild that main homepage?
Agent: Got it.
Agent: And so let me double click in the second part, and the broad stroke, right?
Agent: So this is stroke one, which is how do you rebuild the homepage. The second thing which [PERSON-3] mentioned was the next best action.
Agent: So from there, because this was the part A of the next best action is to part A was out of, let's say, 11 opportunities.
Agent: What are the five I should be looking at?
Agent: We did the first step by prioritizing it for them in that view that they're looking at. That's the step one. Step two is now that you've gotten that and they only have five items.
Agent: So every day they're coming and just clicking one, two, three, four, five, right?
Agent: They go through that when they click one, it takes them to the detailed view of that opportunity. Let's just say that. Once you get there, that opportunity already has two more sub-idens.
Agent: One is it has a view where you can see it's actual [ORG-2] next best action feature, which is part of the [PRODUCT-3] driven, where knowing what the stage the opportunity is, it is already telling you do this next.
Agent: So what it will tell you is, let's just say if it's a beginning, you know, like you've just thought it, right?
Agent: It's a new customer. Hey, you shouldn't make a call and you haven't logged a call. That's, so we have programmed that next best action for them.
Agent: If it's mid-journey where you've already been, let's say, stage three, right, and it's moving towards close and it's already tracking, what you would then see is, hey, you should be, you know, getting this approval because you're a negotiation stage and it has been done for, let's [DATE-23], right?
Agent: So it will trigger based on those conditions in your next best action, in this case, right?
Agent: Has to be this and it's not done yet. So that's just the sales agent view.
Agent: There's also a manager view where they would get a list of all these things that were supposed to be action and they haven't action yet.
Agent: So there is all these different parts of this play in the flow that was tailor made for them.
EndUser: I think we took like, I would say roughly six two eight months to do that. But it took us a while to get that part.
EndUser: So I know we are [TIME-4], right?
EndUser: So as a next action item, right?
EndUser: From your perspective, kind of a view, right?
EndUser: If that is something that you can't show it this time, if you can show us not a customer data again, right?
EndUser: However you want to show us so that we understand. Something more that I really, I personally like to know more about customization flow.
EndUser: Because that's something that is not clicking in my head, right?
EndUser: It's me, I don't think more about it. When you say that home page has to be customized, we are core engine or business rules perspective, like what we can show That's something on top.
EndUser: I need to think more about on that and that notion. I don't know if I'm a [PERSON-11], excell [PERSON-16], if you guys want to get it.
EndUser: I would echo that, just the layout really, not necessarily the customer data, to be sure.
EndUser: So this is the rep view, right?
EndUser: I would also add that since we have the desire to see some sort of layout for our leaders, for our manager management view, I would also like to see what works, right, in your past experiences, for when you create these views and home pages for the managers, I would imagine that they would like to see the metrics for their reps, for example, or possibly highlights or insights or summary of top strengths, up weaknesses in their teams.
EndUser: Top what needs to be done in order to get to the booking
Agent: Number or what needs to be improved and so on and so forth.
Agent: It's a different view versus the rep level, right?
Agent: But that's something I would like to request on top of what [PERSON-21] mentioned. Yeah, I'll take a note of it. I don't know if I will have something. I know we have the agent here that's possible, but
EndUser: I don't think manage it. We'll do what are best to figure out, bring out that information. And that's it. [PERSON-4] from your perspective, Excello 23.
EndUser: Hey, [PERSON-23], I know Yeah, sorry, I was so late.
EndUser: You.
EndUser: I had another meeting that was double book.
EndUser: Have we shared with them what we've been able to do so far in rev intelligence?
EndUser: Yes. Yes. Okay. Back on what we've done thus any glaring
Agent: Far guys, opportunities to improve our current
Agent: State. And if you guys are happy to repeat it for my benefit. No, we hate him. I hope you're well. We, um, We did review it. I mean, we didn't review it in detail.
Agent: One of the things that we gave, you know, just at a high level, you know, how we did it with a little bit more customized for this customer.
Agent: Like, I don't want to, you know, it wasn't there's out of the box and then there's out of the box with flavor.
Agent: And so this has a little more flavor where we sort of layered the dashboards and talk with each other so that you could choose what you wanted to see.
Agent: If you wanted to lead opportunities, you want to see accounts, things like that, you could see the different data sets and the different dashboard.
Agent: The other thing is really focusing on, well, the customer really wanted to focus on the [PRODUCT-2] portion and being able to intelligently direct their selling teams towards campaigns that they were running.
Agent: So that allowed for very quickly the sales rep to come in either to the larger dashboard or to their opportunities and say. The next thing I have to do is make a call.
Agent: The next thing I have to do is commit this task or do this activity.
EndUser: And that's where they wanted to get the most amount of benefit. That's what they were trying to try.
EndUser: How getting that same?
Agent: Close are we to
EndUser: Because I'm very interested in that as well. How far off how close are we to getting that level of capability
Agent: Or value out of the [PRODUCT-2] engine?
Agent: I don't know what you, we didn't dive into your solution. that much and we can certainly do that. But [PERSON-21], I don't know if you have a view on that
EndUser: On what you've done so far.
EndUser: So what I showed you right earlier, let me show it again, right?
EndUser: This is what me, I think this is the page, sorry, I'm trying to figure out which screen is going to get
EndUser: Image view it is sorry. Yeah, I think there's the page here. So.
EndUser: What what I showed you earlier, right?
EndUser: This is this is what we have done from from the from the pages perspective and and out of the box for team and you guys are talking is as more if I understand the customization view on top of it.
EndUser: That will give us more insights.
Agent: Yeah, it's the change from having a very solid dashboard component that it says, here's where we are to what is the information that user needs to feed to make a determination.
Agent: And so what is it?
Agent: What is the action that needs to be taken based
EndUser: On that data?
EndUser: That's the next step, really.
EndUser: How can we go there?
EndUser: Hopefully we can get a formula that we create on our scoring methodology, like a health score, or where we are in sales page progression.
EndUser: Like, what are the things that we need to be doing in order to create that view of visibility?
Agent: Yeah, so on ours, did we do that through the dashboards?
Agent: We do that through the opportunity
Agent: Pages after the dashboards.
Agent: It was a combination of both, right?
Agent: So we had to use analytics to do some of these components, but we also used the core to do some of the configuration and customizations. So it was blend
EndUser: Of both those technologies. Now, what you were saying, [PERSON-23], that took [DATE-11] to get right.
Agent: Yes, but I think the part I think we're missing is we're talking technology, and I touched upon this part of the project journey is really understanding what's going to help your sales team, right?
Agent: And that's the tailored part of it, which is figuring that out what the pain points are and what's going to work for them.
Agent: That to me was like the crux, the build up, if you will, because once we got that, the solutioning then started becoming straightforward, because then it's like technology data we can bring, and
EndUser: We know, the what can go. to be tailored.
EndUser: So for my team, I think we need to look at this through two different lenses I think there's the [ORG-9] motion, which is the hunters, pipeline conversion rate-oriente d relative sales progression .
Agent: And that's very
EndUser: And I think if we're looking at those metrics and those dashboards, especially around the forecast element, those are going to be our vital few metrics that we're going to want to promote front and center to the AEs, anybody that's in an AEs persona.
EndUser: From an AM for perspective, it's more about and work from a perspective relative to their current entitlements, how many licenses, what's their buyin g behavior, how many licenses, how wall to wall are we from a product portfolio perspective those are going to be the key metrics that we're looking at from an AM standpoint, right Especially those from a product perspective that are [ORG-14] only , that are potential [ORG-19] from a campaign standpoint.
EndUser: The health of the customer
EndUser: Because I think that's where the campaign piece of what they were just mentioning really comes into play.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: What are we doing from a, from a, from an AM perspective to put the next best action in front of them.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: Based on the health of the current customer and install base. So, I think I understand, I just don't know enough about how do we build this in.
EndUser: Out, you know, outside of [ORG-9] based on the different objects and get that more customized. I just don't know what that entails.
Agent: It's a hard question, right?
Agent: So a real search learning, but you know, it's also about how do we answer that?
Agent: Because it is, um, the technology piece, I think we answered like this, when it's a customization, that's the configuration.
Agent: Like we get the architects involved and, you know, they figure out, okay, here's what the math is to do solve this problem, right?
Agent: So it's not like we're gonna sit through this to do that. But in terms of big chunks, right, there is first part is you explain the process, here's what they need to do.
Agent: What I shared before we jumped on the call was this customer that I was explaining, that was a before and after picture.
Agent: Before they had like 14 widgets that has doing all this math that had all the like they were they had data scientists working o n Figuring all these KPIs and projecting on those home pages both for managers all different persona s What I'm getting at it is sort of a breakthrough throughout for this group, is that the right answer?
Agent: That customer came off doing that, spent [DATE-16] and, you know, obviously many dollars getting there.
Agent: But is that the right answer?
Agent: Because what they learned in their journey was it wasn't helping. And so they had to get to the next level from there.
Agent: And so where the inside of the stories I'm bringing to the table is really, they were like step two of this process.
Agent: And my question back to you is, He was still wanting to go back and you know, we can still do step one, right?
Agent: We can still help build that the story I was bringing was not actually doing that. They were like, hey, we done with this. We got to go to the next level.
EndUser: So it's a very different view.
Agent: We can still do step
EndUser: One and say, okay, here's all the different things you can build.
EndUser: What I think our [ORG-14] for us, quite honestly, is right now we use a [ORG-23] for our forecasting and deal reviews, right?
EndUser: We use [ORG-11], [ORG-16] and BI environments to do our customer health. And so we've got a lot of pivots, so our sales efficiency is incredibly poor.
EndUser: What Revenue Intelligence brings to us is from a forecast commit pipeline view where we're pivoting three, four times into different environments, different tools. Revenue intelligence brings that all front and center.
EndUser: At least I know what I'm talking about relative to in sales scores in a very formula way.
EndUser: Like, what's my priority?
EndUser: I got frickin. You know, I got to do 59k in my 98k in ARR [DATE-21]. And here's my top 10. And I got 3x coverage.
EndUser: If I can get that through a single pane of glass, OK, check box, right?
EndUser: Make one step in the right direction. Because right now I got to pivot to three places to get that view. And I'm doing off sheet forecast.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So I mean, we're talking about some pretty basic stuff. So you clear on that view and I think I get that.
Agent: By the way, we have a seller view ourselves too, right?
EndUser: So my question back to you is then what's blocking you?
EndUser: That's not clear to me.
EndUser: What was blocking me right now is, The team is stumbling and stammering through the creation of the views and what to bring into line of sight for as far as what's prioritized for the reps.
EndUser: They don't know what they don't know.
EndUser: I mean, literally they're hunting and pecking through the dashboards and the views to say, oh, yeah, this is a better view than the last one I just looked at for [TIME-5].
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: I want to know what good looks like if you guys got some templates and say just do this and then we can get into our pilot to prove value and then they can go back and start looking at, you know, different views
EndUser: To bring in different parts of the puzzle in the future. But like, I'm struggling just to get an MV.
EndUser: So this goes back to the original thing before [PERSON-23] joined what I was talking about with [PERSON-4] and MLAs, the boxes, right?
EndUser: What you just talked about?
EndUser: The seller's view, that what are the what they see from the what the next action items they have to do?
EndUser: When the login, they need to know that these are my actions that I need to take or this is what I need to do.
EndUser: That's the view portion, right?
EndUser: What I was talking about is what we need to know that.
EndUser: So it became- Yeah, but even before that, [ORG-21], I think this, like, consider the actions and any sort of [PRODUCT-2] component to this to me that that's great. Yeah, let's keep that line of sight and our focus.
EndUser: But I just want to know, like- If you were to roll out an instance in [ORG-9] 10 times, what are the eight things that every one of those instances are going to have?
EndUser: Like, what's the bottle do you look like?
EndUser: Because like right now, I mean, think about our current instance, [PERSON-9], [PERSON-3], you guys have seen it. But [PERSON-9], I know you've seen it. It's a mess. It's five generations, [DATE-23] of undocumented. It is a freaking mess.
EndUser: I might as well take [ORG-23], turn it upside down and try and read it.
EndUser: That's how bad it is, right?
EndUser: And so I just want to use. I just want.
EndUser: It's opportunity to get something fresh and new and focus for in a single pane of glass on their business.
EndUser: What does a vital few look like?
EndUser: What's the recommendation out of the 10?
EndUser: Like last Implementation you guys did, if you were to say there were eight out of 10, these were the common elements, and this is how it laid out. And the workflow, bam, that's my MVP, I'm off and running.
EndUser: Now let's talk about [PRODUCT-2].
EndUser: Okay, what's out of the box [PRODUCT-2] component?
EndUser: To this so that we can enrich the experience so that we can now start leaning into the next best action. Great. I'll take that because my team is not deep enough to understand their learning.
EndUser: They're spending more time getting an education on [ORG-2] right now than putting something in production for me. I'm paying a lot of money to put these guys through [ORG-2] school. That's to me, that's just bullshit.
EndUser: So I've been looking for some help here. Like.
EndUser: Give me something that I can fit into for an MVP so I can show instant value on revenue intelligence.
Agent: I think that's we need to come up with some we'll let us go back come up with some examples for each M. I think you know the the one that we shared you know that we've talked about That was a pretty custom solution.
Agent: I don't want to white like showed me the [ORG-23].
EndUser: Makes you think that that's you're out of lives. You You sold the car.
Agent: Yeah, well, I mean, I got to make you comfy and confident with our goodness.
Agent: But no, it's a tough one, right?
Agent: Because I, you know, it is, you know, this is this is classic report the dashboard conversation, right?
Agent: You know, it is very particular. But you're right in the sense that there are commonality. So I think Mar and I can reach out, find some more examples and get you some common themes.
Agent: Let us see if we can do that. I do have to jump to another meeting.
EndUser: I apologize.
Agent: But I get where you're after [PERSON-23] and help enable the team so they can sort of a good design,
EndUser: Replicate you know, at least to start them. Just to get us an [ORG-14], because we don't want to be so off base, like we don't know we just need to look in the right place for the right.
EndUser: Parts
EndUser: Of the dashboards that, again, back to what's good, but you guys know better than us. Like, what's really
Agent: Resonating with the customers?
Agent: And if they're getting more value out of something that we just don't know. I want to say the expectation.
Agent: So I want to say, yes, we'll get to you the examples, if you will, but I can also tell you, based on like we have in Professional services, we do this many times and across different customers, to your point.
Agent: And what it comes down to is we have to sit with them to tailor it. So number one lesson is listening with empathy to figure out what that works for them has been different for every customer.
Agent: Like I can, to your point, I can look at 23 customers and they're all going to have different examples.
Agent: So this to do, you're asking, has that been standardized?
Agent: The short answer is no. That's why they come to us saying he cannot tailor this. Number one.
Agent: Number two, once we take that journey, what we have often found is to your point, like there's an [ORG-14] or a pilot phase, and then we constantly iterate to fine tune what the final version looks like that we launched.
Agent: But even then, it's never stable. Like there's a repetition and constant flow of how it needs to iterate and fine tune because business keeps changing. The priorities keep changing.
Agent: So there is no standardized way of saying, hey, this is once and done. It's like a constant thing in motion. Like even the ones we launched, I'm pretty sure the customer has it.
Agent: We've given them the tools to manage it. And they're tuning it in a different way so that they can continue with the business. So keep that in mind. We'll give you a static view of what we're sharing.
Agent: But I don't think I can go
EndUser: Put a standpoint saying, hey, this is one standard that works for everyone. And that's what we don't have. Yeah, no, that's fine. I get it. I get it. That I can totally appreciate your comments there. Thank
EndUser: You.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: So the next step, right?
Agent: Yeah, I have to jump. And we'll say, yeah, we'll send Okay you very
EndUser: Out something as soon as we can. sounds good. Thanks. Thank much. I know.
EndUser: Thanks",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So let me ask you, would you adding something?

2. ""I'm a seller. They're all commissioned. They have the same deal to do with, hopefully that's already in place, right? Which means they're driven. The question I'm asking is, if I'm the seller, do we have enough insight? As to what are they saying, what are their pinpoints, what are they saying is stopping them?""

The customer engaged in a conversation about their current process for collecting data on lost reasons and their interest in understanding sellers' pain points within their organization.

The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if there were opportunities where the sales representative could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of their company or product. The conversation primarily focuses on understanding the customer's needs, their current sales process, and the challenges they face.

4. Difficulty identifying the right products to sell to customers: The customer expressed a need for better insights into what products their customers currently have, as all of that has traditionally been done outside of their system.

5. Lack of a clear seller's view: The customer was looking for a clear view of what a seller should focus on when they log in, including their next steps and when they're due. They also wanted to ensure that sales managers have consistent feedback on sales opportunities to prevent them from dying on the vine.

6. Difficulty in understanding sales rep pain points: The customer collects data on lost reasons but wanted to better understand their sellers' pain points within their internal space.

7. Sales rep methodology inconsistency: The customer mentioned that not all of their sellers use the same methodologies, which makes it difficult to manage their business effectively.

8. Need for a more tailored solution: The customer expressed a need for a more tailored solution that addresses their specific pain points and business needs. They were interested in understanding how the product can be customized to fit their requirements.

9. Sales efficiency: The customer mentioned that their sales efficiency is poor due to pivoting between multiple environments and tools for forecasting, deal reviews, and customer health. They were looking for a single pane of glass solution to improve their sales efficiency.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""So, if you think about a set of personas, what do they look like?""
2. ""What are the pain points that the sellers are facing within your space?""
3. ""What would you see change for these salespeople? How would they be more effective in your mind?""

9. ""What does the sales rep see when they log in to the system?""
10. ""What are the top five or six things that you should look at from the dashboard standpoint?""
11. ""What are the calculations, what are the variables to be considered for per transaction that makes it to be in their five items for every person?""
12. ""What does the manager level view look like?""
13. ""What metrics or insights would managers like to see for their reps?""
14. ""What are the vital few metrics that we're going to want to promote front and center to the AEs?""
15. ""What are the key metrics that we're looking at from an AM standpoint?""
16. ""What does good look like if you guys got some templates and say just do this?""
17. ""What are the eight things that every one of those instances are going to have?""
18. ""What's the bottleneck?""
19. ""What are the common elements, and this is how it laid out?""
20. ""What's the out-of-the-box [PRODUCT-2] component to enrich the experience?""

These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs, pain points, and expectations, allowing them to tailor their approach and solutions accordingly.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly state that the seller's product meets their needs. They discussed various challenges and requirements they have for sales management and analytics, and the seller provided some insights into how their product could potentially address those needs. However, the customer also expressed concerns about the complexity of the product and the need for a more streamlined and customized solution. The customer seemed interested in exploring the product further to determine if it can meet their needs, but a definitive conclusion was not reached during the call.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current process for managing leads and opportunities. The customer mentions that they maintain a dashboard for sending sales performance cards, but it's not enough to provide the necessary insights. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current pain points and challenges with their existing system.

2. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific use case for the product. The customer mentions that they want to leverage the product as a dashboard, but it's not clear if they have a specific workflow or process in mind. The sales rep could have asked more questions about how the customer plans to use the product and what specific features or functionalities they are interested in.

3. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's sales process and metrics. The customer mentions that they want to establish a baseline with the product and then add additional metrics in the future. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current sales process, what metrics they track, and how they define success.

4. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's technical requirements. The customer mentions that they want to avoid clutter and noise for the reps and managers using the product. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's technical infrastructure, what other tools or systems they use, and how they plan to integrate the product with their existing workflow.

5. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's timeline and implementation plan. The customer mentions that they want to start with a baseline and then add additional metrics in the future. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's timeline for implementation, what resources they have available, and what their long-term goals are for the product.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,The customer expressed excitement about the potential of the seller's product to provide better insights into their customers' existing products and install base.

EndUser: Them.
Agent: [PERSON-1] and [ORG-1] you pull together the requirements document is that correct?
Agent: You're muted if you can hear us.
EndUser: [ORG-1] you're muted if you're with us.
Speaker 5: Hello, hi. Yeah.
Speaker 5: Hi, sorry,
Speaker 5: My connection is not good. So your voice is calm on and off. So I'm sorry if I missed something. I just want to let you know. And all of you first.
Agent: Okay, are you going to be able to hear [DATE-1]'s presentation or should we wait until your connection is better?
Speaker 5: Well, I can let's proceed.
Agent: Okay, fantastic, fantastic. Well, thanks so much for hopping on.
Agent: My understanding is that you pulled together the requirements document with the resource development teams feedback and their needs and the requirements for a solution, is that correct?
Speaker 5: Yes, that's correct. Not just for a digital storage development, but also for the communication.
Agent: Awesome. Okay, so we're super excited then [DATE-1] to kind of show you a little bit about the solution, right, and how [ORG-2] can be helpful with both resource development and the Marketing team in their effort.
Agent: And so I've prepared a presentation and if you don't have any questions or any thoughts before we kick off, I'll go ahead and share my screen and we can get rolling.
Speaker 5: All right.
Speaker 5: Yes, let's go ahead with the presentation.
Agent: Awesome. Okay.
Agent: Can you see my screen now?
Agent: Yes, I can. Awesome. Okay. All right. So let's get rolling here. Before we get too deep into any solutioning, [ORG-2] requires that I share this with you. This is a slide we won't make you read this.
Agent: Sorry, I just kicked over my space heater. It's a little chilly here [DATE-1]. We don't want to cause a fire.
Agent: This is a slide I'm not going to require you to read it, but it essentially says, hey, make your purchasing decision based upon technology that's currently available. Reasonable enough. All right.
Agent: So what are we going to talk about here [DATE-1]?
Agent: First, we're going to kick off a little bit about [ORG-2]. I know, [PERSON-2], we've talked in the past and given you kind of a background about our company and our values.
Agent: But for [ORG-3], I believe this is the first time you'll be hearing most of that. So we'll chat a little bit about [ORG-2] and how we align with the mission of C4 and the work that you all do.
Agent: Then we're going to cut into what we've heard, right?
Agent: We've had a number of discovery conversations where we've learned about your organization. the goals, the challenges that you have, as well as in reviewing the requirements document that you all provided.
Agent: And so we'll do a recap of what we've heard. And then we're going to jump into what we recommend. So in this scenario, a little spoiler here. We're recommending nonprofit cloud and [PRODUCT-1] account engagement.
Agent: A coupling of these two solutions from [ORG-2] are going to give you the ability to support your resource development team and your Marketing team in any sort of donor engagement activities that you're looking to support based on the requirements document.
Agent: And lastly, we're going to talk about investment. Now I understand and saw that you all viewed the demo [TIME-1] and so you have a little bit of a background about nonprofit cloud.
Agent: When we get to that section, I hope that you'll ask as many questions or provide any feedback that you have about that solution.
Agent: And just so that you kind of have some context of who we have on the call here [DATE-1], we have [PERSON-3], who is our [ORG-4], who helped design the solutions that right that we're recommending for you all based off of her knowledge of your organization and your needs.
Agent: We also have [PERSON-4] on the call. [PERSON-5] is our Marketing specialist and helped identify the correct Marketing solution for the organization.
Agent: And we have [PERSON-6], who is from the Implementation team at Agile, who we've recommended, will bring these solutions to life and make them unique and customized to your specific needs at the organization.
Agent: So throughout [DATE-1]'s call, you'll hear all of us kind of jumping in at different points and times to kind of fill in any points that you have, answer any questions.
Agent: And while this is a presentation, please, please, don't let me talk for [TIME-2]. I want your feedback. I want your thoughts. I want to hear, yes, we've gotten this right.
Agent: Or, hey, no, I've got questions or, you know, there's some gray area that we need some clarification on.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Agent: Can I get your buy-in on that?
Agent: Awesome. Okay.
Agent: And a little stat in statistics, because [ORG-2] is such a data-driven company in itself, right, because we have a sophisticated technology stack, we have a lot of information from our customers, from our partners in the nonprofit space that we like to share with you all.
Agent: And so folks who invest in these solutions and are digitally mature organizations, they say that they're three and a half times more likely to reach their goals.
Agent: So when we're talking about value and return on investment, there will be some statistics weaved in throughout this presentation. And so please do ask questions or give feedback if you're curious about anything value related.
Agent: Okay. Before we do any of that, I need to say thank you to you all. Thank you so much for the investment you have made in this evaluation.
Agent: I know [PERSON-2], you and I started talking in [DATE-2], which is unbelievable. [PERSON-7], I know that you've gone through and had, you know, deep conversations and surveyed the different team members that would be impacted by this decision.
Agent: And really invested a lot of time and energy and understanding with the goals and challenges of your organization are.
Agent: And so thank you both so much for that work and that time and the energy that you've put into it and for allowing [ORG-2] to be part of that evaluation process.
Agent: I also need to say thank you, thank you, thank you for the good work you're doing in the world.
Agent: The work that you do to protect our natural spaces and our forests and our trees, and the global climate is so critically important. [PERSON-8], I know [PERSON-2]'s probably heard this too many times now.
Agent: My background is in the nonprofit space. I spent [DATE-3] working for nonprofit organizations here in [GPE-1].
Agent: Most recently, I was the Development Director and Chief Fundraising Officer for a nonprofit organization called [ORG-5], which is does just what it sounds like.
Agent: It protects our natural spaces and our national parks here within [GPE-1]. I raised [MONEY-1] during their centennial campaign. I know you guys are in your [DATE-4].
Agent: And so you probably have some lofty fundraising goals attached to that as well. And prior to that.
Agent: I was the development director at an organization that you might be familiar with and is a global organization, but I was in [GPE-1] chapter called [ORG-6] and it's under different names throughout the world.
Agent: So certainly my background and your work fully online, I am so appreciative of the good work you're doing in the world to protect all of us. So thank you.
Agent: I want to spend [TIME-3] talking about our core values as a company.
Agent: I've shared a little bit about my core values as an individual, but I think that, you know, I was drawn to [ORG-2], right, after being in a nonprofit space because of the work that they do and the core values that they share with me.
Agent: Things like trust, customer success, innovation, equity, and sustainability. These are our driving pillars. And I can tell you, going from a nonprofit background, right, [DATE-3] of experience in a nonprofit space, moving into the corporate space.
Agent: Gave me a little bit of pause. But this is a company that really owns and lives these values. And it's something that I'm really proud to be part of.
Agent: And I hope that you'll be proud to be part of [ORG-2] as well in a future partnership.
Agent: And with that, I wanna talk specifically about our work and sustainability, right?
Agent: This is a one of our core pillar values that I didn't create that last slide. That is [ORG-2]'s, I, you know, Marketing materials, if you will. Those are our company's core pillars and core values.
Agent: And so I wanted to share this slide specifically because it talks a little bit about the commitment that we've made to sustainability.
Agent: So we have a solution called Not Zero Cloud that helps companies and corporations track right their carbon footprint. and understand the impact that they're having on our planet and on our society and our world.
Agent: And that's something that we have heavily invested in as a company. That's because we believe that business is a driver for change. We believe that business can be a driver for good and for change at [ORG-2].
Agent: We also have in the center of how long some information about our commitment to doing work that is probably near and dear to your heart, which is a reforestation right a commitment to planting trees.
Agent: We have a goal to conserve and restore and grow trees by [DATE-5]. We have a goal of planting 1 trillion trees, which I don't know like actually I want your feedback. Are we on.
Agent: Is that like a good goal. Should we be striving for more. Maybe we. we have that conversation offline.
Agent: But I feel really good about it being part of our company' s core values and I want to just kind of express and stress tha t We have alignment between our organizations, right?
Agent: Even though we work in very different spaces, this is something that's very important to us. And then I want to take kind of a step back and just kind of explain our business model at large.
Agent: Salesforce solutions are the world's number one [PRODUCT-2] solution. Number one in the world by third party review. Our Marketing solution is also number one in the world by third party review. Okay.
Agent: We as a company have invested a lot of time and energy in different verticals. So think about everything from, hey, you need to open a bank account to how you're going to visit a doctor.
Agent: One of our verticals is nonprofit work. We service over 49,000 nonprofit organizations globally with our fund or fund raising is what we're talking about [DATE-1]. But with our solutions or CRM solutions are Marketing solutions are community solutions.
Agent: If you were to need a portal where people can log in to get. We can go on with [ORG-7], which I know you guys are also exploring and in evaluating right now.
Agent: Within the 49,000 organizations and within our [ORG-2] organization at large, we have a one-one-one model. That one-one-one model means that we donate [PERCENT-1] of our solutions.
Agent: You'll see that in the concessions that we've applied to when we get to the investment piece. of our time volunteerism at [ORG-2] is very important.
Agent: We all have what we call [ORG-8] volunteer time off and we're very much required to use it in our communities.
Agent: And [PERCENT-2] of our profits and you can see that in really the donations that are the very public so you can go to them that our CEO [PERSON-9] makes as well as a model of What's the word I'm looking for?
Agent: I'm stumbling here. When I make a donation, a corporate match. So there's a corporate match model here at [ORG-2] as well. So that's a little bit about us. I want to push pause. See if you have any questions.
Agent: I know you guys have a formal process of learning about our organization, some formal questions that you'll have for us.
Agent: But I wanted to give kind of that overview to kind of explain who we are, who you're talking with and kind of lay that foundation.
EndUser: [PERSON-10], do you want to jump in?
Speaker 5: Do you have any questions?
Speaker 5: No, I have no
EndUser: Question. Okay.
Agent: Me too. This is great. Thanks. Fantastic. All right. All right. So let's dive into you all. We've talked a little bit about [ORG-2], who we are.
Agent: I want to talk a little bit about what I've heard over the last, how many [DATE-6] since [DATE-2], what we read in the requirements document, and some kind of key pieces that we've pulled out.
Agent: You had a lot listed in the requirements document that was so helpful.
Agent: But I've tried to kind of put them into some buckets here and kind of... be able to talk through how we can help in each of those buckets throughout the rest of our call here [DATE-1].
Agent: So at the center, you'll see the woman in the middle is the need for a relationship centric model. So at [ORG-2], what we call this is a constituent 488.
Agent: We'll put that individual in the center of everything that you do in your [PRODUCT-2] solution.
Agent: You'll be able to track everything from their name, address, phone number, right?
Agent: Simple data to collect and to track. To their interactions with the organization.
Agent: Who reached out to them last?
Agent: What does that communication look like?
Agent: Was it a phone call?
Agent: Was it an email?
Agent: Was it an in-person meeting?
Agent: What are the notes from that conversation?
Agent: So collecting all that data and information into one single source of truth.
Agent: You'll also be able to track her through a process, right?
Agent: Whether that is moving through the donor cycle.
Agent: If you're in a cultivation phase, a solicitation phase, et cetera, right?
Agent: You'll have that information on her record as well. You can store all of her giving history on that record so that you have all of that information in the center.
Agent: And the goal is to have a holistic view of that individual. You want to know all of the different moving pieces.
Agent: Do they like to volunteer, right?
Agent: Do they, are they a board member as well?
Agent: Do they sit on a committee at a funding foundation?
Agent: Are they part of a government funding group?
Agent: All of that information will be stored in that individual's record on their account so that you have that holistic view of who they are and their relationship with your organization.
Agent: Now because we're also talking about a [NORP-1] Salesforce Marketing solution, it will also pull in that data and information about what they're engaging with, what they're opening, what they're clicking on.
Agent: What they're most interested in, right?
Agent: Maybe this is an organization that is most interested in the work you're doing, or individual that's most interested in the work you're doing in [LOC-1], right?
Agent: You want to have that information so that you can target them with the core pieces of information that are going to excite them, right, and inspire their giving. This solution is going to allow for all of that.
Agent: So at the center of everything we do is that relationship management solution that [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: Does that make sense so far?
Speaker 5: Yes.
EndUser: Yeah, that's great.
Agent: Perfect. Okay.
Agent: And I kind of coming off on the two sides, right?
Agent: Are all of the impact that is going to happen from the [ORG-2] solution, right?
Agent: You've got, you've got your, your donor in the center. And then I want to go towards, well, I guess it's towards my left. I hope it's towards yours left as well. That collaborative workspace.
Agent: We know that you all are a global organization. You have folks in many, many different countries that need licenses as we've learned in the requirements document.
Agent: How do we make sure that you are all fully aligned in one solution so that if, you know, there is somebody in one part of the world who needs information about, what are we expecting this check?
Agent: Right?
Agent: That's always the question.
Agent: When is this gift coming?
Agent: Questions like that can be answered through the solution. So a collaborative workspace where everybody is able to share information and get information. With the caveat of there is the ability for you to control who can view what.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So if there are folks that only need to see part of the solution and part of the data that's being stored in the [PRODUCT-2], they can only see that piece.
Agent: Now we're not here to talk about [ORG-7] [DATE-1], but I would be remiss if I didn't just mention that is part of what we are recommending to the organization.
Agent: We are suggesting and quite frankly, insisting at this point that you guys also invest in [ORG-7]. That was a separate conversation, but I will say [ORG-7] is a solution that will be directly connected to your [ORG-2] instance.
Agent: So that you are able to use it as a collaborative workspace for things like talking about different grant opportunities where you are in the process, project management, having data and information, so I'll wear appropriate.
Agent: So these two solutions, right, that we're recommending, [ORG-7] and then nonprofit cloud and Marketing cloud, they all work in collaboration. Happy to dive into that more as our conversation continues on.
Agent: We also have heard you're going to be data driven.
Agent: And this kind of goes to outcome focused as well, right?
Agent: You want to be able to look at a dashboard and see where you are succeeding and where more time and energy needs to be invested to reach your goals. This solution is going to allow you to do that.
Agent: You're going to be able to make sound decisions about how you spend your time, your energy, and your resources based upon solid data and information.
Agent: You're going to have clear expectations for each one of your different fundraising and resource development team members around, you know, how often who they're reaching out to where their top priorities need to be as far as the most likely individuals to give or the most likely institutions to give.
Agent: When grants are going to be sunsetting or when you need to be submitting a renewal or a new proposal, all of that data and information is going to be stored in this single source of truth in your [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: Any questions on that?
Agent: Okay. All right. And then outcome focus.
Agent: You're going to want to know, right?
Agent: Because hand in hand with those data decisions, you're going to want to know. Hey, we spent, you know, X number of hours working on this proposal.
Agent: Did we get it?
Agent: What is the success rate of our proposal and our grant writing?
Agent: What is the success rate in different buckets?
Agent: Hey, our folks really interested in one area of work right now and we're not getting funding in another. Those types of information is going to be really important to the organization moving forward.
Agent: And then last, but certainly not least is this personalized experience.
Agent: So I talked at the beginning about the woman in the middle, right, collecting all the data and information about her and her interest and her engagement with the organization and her passions and her giving, etc, etc.
Agent: What do you do with that?
Agent: That's the question. Right. So now you have all that information.
Agent: How do you transform that into something that's powerful for your organization?
Agent: You do that through a connected and native Marketing solution. And that's what we're recommending here [DATE-1].
Agent: A solution that's going to allow you to segment your list, target the right individuals with the right message at the right time to get the right result, right?
Agent: So we are going to be talking holistically through each one of these components through the rest of our call. We're already [TIME-4] in to our [TIME-5] conversation.
Agent: And so we're going to have to move a little bit quicker here than I have so far. But I do want to know I want to hear your feedback.
Agent: It's important for us to understand if we're if we're talking the same language, right?
Agent: Oh, and speaking of languages, we can support all the languages that you had in the resource in your requirements documents. So we can check that box as well. But feedback from you all on what you've seen so far.
Speaker 5: Well, yeah, it's interesting to learn about the all the feature of the data drive data given and collaborative work space and then at the end each of the personal will have their own work space that basically will giving them information about what they've been doing and what they can do next or later and whom they should be able to have.
Speaker 5: Which actually is in line or in line with the one that we would like to have. We would like to see for a crowd we are planning to have what we call as a number one.
Speaker 5: Or that what we call it, my three, [PERSON-2], is actually that kind of fit that each person will have their own portal that's giving them information about what they should do.
Agent: And then we're making that really, it's with them. So it's nice to learn about that here. Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: And so I think that we are aligned here, right?
Agent: So what I'm hearing from you is a vision of each individual logging in and having some sort of roadmap of what they should be doing and spending their time on and where their priorities are, the most likely to give that kind of information.
Speaker 5: So a dashboard, of outlines where the where the
Agent: If you will, that kind
Agent: Potential is right for forgiving.
Agent: Is that where, can I hear that right?
Agent: Yes, correct. Well, we can do that. That's our bread and butter. If you will.
EndUser: That's what we, where we thrive is helping organizations and supporting that type of environment. So I had one question also. I mean, to me, what's quite interesting is the. The.
EndUser: Kind of portfolio management side of it and especially looking at program areas that are underfunded or program areas that are specifically successful at the moment and market analysis around.
EndUser: You know, giving and, you know, and targets and so forth.
EndUser: So it'd be interesting to hear about, you know, how we can, you know, kind of customize, you know, KPIs that we want to focus on, you know, that it was touched on a bit, but I think that's an area that would be of particular interest to us.
EndUser: So maybe if we could
Agent: Dig into that part of the solution a little bit would be great. Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: And so [PERSON-2], you're hitting the nail on the head here, right?
Agent: So our solution out of the box, we, we, we like to say that it is [PERCENT-3] ready to go for you, right?
Agent: It has all of the bones and infrastructure for thinking of it like a house.
Agent: Now that customization piece, that's where Agile is going to come in and [PERSON-8] and his team are going to come in and they're going to do a period of time of deep discovery with you all to learn about those KPIs.
Agent: To learn about those different programs that you are raising funds for, to learn which viewers need to see, which things of that nature.
Agent: And that's a very short list for a very long list of things that they will want to learn from you all.
Agent: And that customization will take place to really take this, you know, out-of-the-box solution that is going to get you [PERCENT-3] to the finish line and make
EndUser: It unique for your organization.
EndUser: Did I answer your question?
EndUser: Yeah, no, that's great. That's great.
EndUser: And how long does that process take?
EndUser: [PERSON-15], are you the duration of that like that component?
Agent: What would you recommend?
Agent: Oh, sorry.
EndUser: [PRODUCT-3] specifically, [PERSON-2]. Yeah, well, just discovering then executing whatever is, you know, agreed upon.
Agent: So sort of going from 98 to 83.
Agent: It depends on what we decide to work on, but for what we're going to present [TIME-6], the timeline is like eight two [DATE-7] depending on what pieces you pick and choose.
Agent: [ORG-9] is usually one two [DATE-8] depending on complexity and then
EndUser: From there, we get into the build process.
EndUser: Okay, and does that require, you know, I mean, do you talk about what's required from our side in terms of, you know, time and commitment and, of things?
Agent: You know, background research we need to do and those kinds
EndUser: Yes, we'll talk. We'll talk all about that.
Agent: Okay. All right. Let's keep moving then. Awesome. And [PERSON-2], just to kind of, you know, piggyback off of, I think our conversation with [PERSON-8] [DATE-9].
Agent: A huge help in that timeline in making sure that the project is moving forward effectively and seamlessly for you all, it's going to be [ORG-7], a collaboration tool that not only can host and support your organization, but also can plug in [PERSON-13] and his team so that there's full alignment, a running conversation of that project, regardless of time zones.
Agent: [PERSON-13] logs into his computer right in the morning and catches up on notes and feedback that the team provided in the afternoon from you all.
Agent: It's going to be in my mind absolutely critical to the success of this project.
EndUser: Right
Agent: Okay. Yeah. Great. Alright, let's keep moving here because I've got about like 13 more slides, so we're going to have to move very quickly through the next couple slides, but I will share them out to you.
Agent: They're text heavy. So you'll be able to fill in the blanks. So a soil over, I know you guys watched the demo [TIME-1].
Agent: The solution that we're recommending for your [PRODUCT-2] is The most appropriate right it's nonprofit cloud.
Agent: It's the solution that supports our nonprofit organizations You have a little bit of a screenshot here on the screen of what a account record could look like in the solution depending on how You customize it with agile But really again it checks the boxes of what we heard from you an ability to nurture authentic Relationships have that clear understanding of each individual empower that data-driven fundraising and boost efficiency and productivity of your teams.
Agent: So everybody knows what they're supposed to be doing, when they're supposed to be doing it, they're engaging in high-impact activities and reaching out to the right people at the right time with the right message.
Agent: All right, again, I'm watching the clock here. I want to make sure that [PERSON-13] has enough time. to talk through anything that he needs to talk with you about.
Agent: And [PERSON-2], your question suggests that you've got some questions for him as well.
Agent: But empowering data-driven fundraising, right?
Agent: Knowing your supporters is critical and scaling your personalization, tailoring your message to each supporter in a release strategic way, that segmentation tool.
Agent: Having insights at a glance, data, dashboards, key metrics, KPIs, [PERSON-2], that you guys are going to want to be able to track.
Agent: And having reports that help you track those types of things and sharing your data across teams, right?
Agent: Giving all of your fundraisers, all of your resource development staff access to different data that is going to empower them to make the right pitch as well, right?
Agent: And have that the right Messaging from your organization.
Agent: Authentic relationships, knowing your supporters again, scaling personalization, And then efficiency and productivity.
Agent: Let's spend some time here, right?
Agent: Knowing that you guys are working globally, different time zones, different work styles, different kind of,
Agent: You know, different teams, different places, we wanted to make sure that we were presenting a solution that would bring you all together. at least virtually, right, if not physically, from time to time.
Agent: So how do we streamline your work while breaking down internal silos, right?
Agent: Getting you off of spreadsheets and out of email and into solutions that are more collaborative, real time, and able to really help each of your individual roles, make sure that they're involved and engaged with the work in that organization, and they have all the information that they need.
Agent: Oh, we lost [PERSON-2]. We still have you, [PERSON-13]. So I'm going to keep rolling here.
Agent: The other piece is, and I know that this was in your requirements document, is wanting this to be a mobile solution, something that folks can access regardless of physically where they are in the world.
Agent: As long as they have an internet connection, they'll be able to connect to the solution either on their cell phones or on their computers. It's completely cloud based.
Agent: And so there will be access, regardless of physically where people are. This is a great part of the platform, especially if you have individuals like I used to, who are traveling very often.
Agent: I know [PERSON-2] is always on the go, go. But folks who are traveling very often, people who are having in-person conversations or meetings.
Agent: Who want to track those conversations and record those notes and update different opportunities, right?
Agent: So if you're taking a donor to lunch or if you're taking them for a tour of one of your facilities or engaging with them in person, having the ability to say, hey, we're moving them.
Agent: I asked, maybe asked or, and so I'm moving it from cultivation to solicitation and in my phasing and so I know that I've made that ask.
Agent: And I'm able to kind of track those types of things in real-time regardless
Speaker 5: Of where I physically am.
Speaker 5: Any questions on this?
Speaker 5: I know.
Agent: Perfect. All right, so this is where we're going to kind of [PERSON-13].
Agent: Are you here?
Agent: We're going to start to segue a little bit from nonprofit cloud into Marketing solutions. So we've talked a little bit about tracking each individual and having that like clear understanding of who they are.
Agent: The cool thing about a [ORG-2] solution is I'm sure that you're doing this with some of your largest funders, right?
Agent: You have this clear understanding of those folks who are making really large contributions to the organization.
Agent: What they care about when you last talked to them, although some of it might be living in people's minds, which is always a dangerous thing.
Agent: You probably have those details, really some of them, about folks who are making really sizable contributions to the organization. What we're talking about here is bringing that to scale.
Agent: Giving you that same ability to track with the same diligence, right, and have that same information about donors who maybe are giving smaller gifts or contributions or mid-size gifts or contributions.
Agent: How do we take your fundraising and allow you to personalize your Outreach to individuals regardless of the size, right?
Agent: So rather than, hey, we only have time to focus on personalization at the top, right, in that small group.
Agent: How do we build that pyramid and make sure that everybody is able to be personalized?
Agent: And we do that through a combination of nonprofit cloud and [PRODUCT-1] that is going to allow you to really target individuals with high touch fundraising efforts and mass Marketing fundraising emails but making them incredibly personal.
Agent: And with that, I'm going to transition this over to [PERSON-5] to talk a little bit about our Marketing solution.
Agent: Thank you. As [PERSON-21] had mentioned, [ORG-10], this is a unique solution because it's the only engagement solution, Marketing engagement solution, that lives within the world's number one [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: And what that means is, not only are you able to really easily use all of the data you have, connected to these individuals, these donors, these stakeholders, within the system and build lists without having to manage two different databases.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Like using [ORG-8], uploading a list, you know, downloading a list, trying to maintain it and make sure that you're reducing risk if someone unsubscribes or takes an action. But you're also able to have all of that.
Agent: Information, including all of their engagement on the website, clicking links in the email, on social media, etc., to understand what's working and what's not working.
Agent: Right?
Agent: And this is very common. I just want to point that out. It's very common.
Agent: Speaking with organizations who are having that challenge, trying to use two different databases, And as a result, we're looking at what's on the left side of the screen, right?
Agent: We're kind of sending sort of batch and blast email messages.
Agent: If we try to integrate the two things, it's not done maybe particularly successfully, right?
Agent: It still requires a lot of manual work. You may have had challenges with email deliverability as a result of some of this.
Agent: And then just segmenting and sending personalized communications is such a challenge, right?
Agent: So we're moving from that to this arena where we can really kind of build a system that allows us to personalize to, well, let me say that again. to automate personalized communications at scale.
Agent: Right?
Agent: And that's really important for small teams, right?
Agent: As so many of our customers that we work with, it's a matter of, hey, how do we be more effective, but also how do we be more efficient, right?
Agent: How do we save time?
Agent: How do we eliminate a lot of this manual effort to send out these communications in the way that we'd like to, And then how do we understand performance and improve performance based on the feedback that we're getting from the system.
Agent: And since this is all in one system, this allows you to do that very effectively.
Agent: Let us know if you have any questions on that, of course, and [PERSON-21], whenever you're ready to proceed to the next slide, we can do that.
Agent: So this is another image. As we send you this deck, we just want to include all of the information that we think will be valuable.
Agent: So [ORG-15] is going to allow you to build out these sort of automated journeys to really unlock that data and the insights to the data. um, increase engagement overall.
Agent: And as you increase engagement, you're going to increase and see an increase in those other KPIs, those other metrics that are critical to your organization, like, like donations, right?
Agent: Um, like involvement in, uh, maybe, you know, a particular event or, um, you'll be able to, to have a finger on that pulse, right, so that you can optimize performance in these journeys and do it at scale.
Agent: So you can increase your database. You can really achieve those metrics that you're striving for.
Agent: You want to move on to the next slide?
Agent: Oh, [ORG-8], yes please.
Speaker 5: I would like to know whether we can do it by ourselves for all the Workflow that is showing us here.
Speaker 5: So in the present data, for example, if I had one specific page for one, for two different denominators, for example, would be possible for me to create a different Workflow for different opportunities. different beliefs.
Agent: Yeah, great question.
Agent: So what you're going to be able to do is create a, let's say call it a drip campaign, right?
Agent: That includes individuals that meet criteria. We only want to reach out to donors who have an average history of giving within this particular range. You can target exactly who you want to target.
Agent: And then you can actually within even the same Workflow or the same drip campaign, send people down different paths with different personalized communications based on their behavior.
Agent: So whether they open an email, whether they filled out a form, whether they click the link in the email, or based on the information you have for them in the system.
Agent: So where they're located, for example, right, would be a good example or anything about their giving history, right?
Agent: Any of these attributes that you have in the database for them.
Agent: So you're going to be able to cover a lot more ground and accomplish a lot more by doing a lot less, right?
Agent: By building out one drip campaign or by building out one email and building the personalization in that email so that each individual person receives the personalized [PRODUCT-4] based on the information you have for them or based on their preferences or actions.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Agent: Is that helpful?
Speaker 5: Yes, thank you.
Agent: Okay, thank you for asking that.
Agent: I want to make sure I always want to check and see, did my answer answer the question you asked?
Agent: Or did
Speaker 5: I misunderstand?
Speaker 5: So thank you. I appreciate that. No, I don't think that's a good answer.
Agent: Good. Thank you. Wonderful. So if we want to go on to
Agent: The next slide, [PERSON-21], or you can chime in.
Agent: Yeah, I just want to make that connection back to, right, as you guys are sending this email and you're able to track that engagement, you're sending people down different paths or journeys depending on how they're responding or not responding right to what you're sending them.
Agent: And kind of putting them on those journeys through the native Marketing solution that data and information is going to.
Agent: Be part of what you're collecting on that individual, right?
Agent: So that you're able to better understand what they react to, right?
Agent: And how they like to engage with your organization, whether that's on a certain subject matter or a certain way of communicating with them, right?
Agent: So all of that is going to go back into your [PRODUCT-2] seamlessly, right?
Agent: We're not talking about importing exporting at all. It's all interconnected with your solution.
Agent: All right, [PERSON-5], I'm moving on. Tell us, give us some ROI metrics.
Agent: Yeah, this is fantastic. And I actually updated this with some of our latest numbers. So, [GPE-2], if you see any disparity here, it's just the fact that wake up early enough.
Agent: I didn't It's a good interview. Okay, let me, let's just do this. Let's stop. I see it here, [PERSON-5]. on the other screen.
Agent: This is a good example Real time collaboration here.
Agent: Of.
Agent: The plane as we fly. Yeah, here we go.
Agent: Thank you [PERSON-21]. So we wanted to include and give you some.
Agent: Text and a framework for understanding, like what should the expectations be over time as we leverage the capabilities of this solution?
Agent: And this is based on our, this, these numbers, and we can update that link to the bottom, is based on the most recent customer success metrics for similar organizations, nonprofits that we work with who have switched from a solution like [ORG-8], right?
Agent: Kind of a third party. separate database, email solution, to a native [ORG-2] Marketing solution, Marketing and engagement solution. And on average, our customers who do that see a increase in return on investment for their Marketing and communications.
Agent: That is, I would interpret.
Agent: A direct result from the increase in efficiency and effectiveness, your ability to personalize those communications, your ability to nurture, right, to automate nurturing those relationships with these individuals.
Agent: In a personalized way, that will cause them to be more receptive to engage, right?
Agent: So it increases engagement overall. And increases a lot of these other metrics. So you see a decrease in the cost to acquire new supporters or donors or subscribers.
Agent: Because of that increase in efficiency, you see [PERCENT-4] increase on average across our customers in
Agent: Engagement overall. A increase. in ad spend optimization for those who are investing in advertising and connecting that to the solution, increase in supporter lifetime value. So they stay with us longer. They give more because they're more engaged.
Agent: So this is the power of really at the most basic level.
Agent: To be able to understand what's important to another person and communicating accordingly, but doing that at scale, right?
Agent: And showing people that you care and showing people that you're listening and you're paying attention and personalizing those communications.
Agent: So it's something we're very proud of, something we wanted to include in the deck for you as we send it over, and something that we wanted to at least briefly address [DATE-1].
Agent: And of course, any questions at all, Sufjib, please, [ORG-13], and we're happy to address them for you.
Speaker 5: No, I have no questions. Please, please.
Agent: Fantastic. All right. All right, let's jump to the next slide. The investment summary.
Agent: We're at the point in the conversation where we're talking about and shifting from, here's what we're recommending and why we're recommending it to the organization, to here's what it's going to cost, right, for the organization to adopt these solutions.
Agent: So you'll see there's two columns, one that outlines really high level. There's no way we could fit everything on this slide about these two solutions. There's a high level.
Agent: Some of the value statements or key pieces of the solution that we think are going to be impactful for you all on the nonprofit cloud [PRODUCT-2] as well as [ORG-15] component.
Agent: Now all in this is going to be an investment for the organization of $[MONEY-2] [DATE-10]. That is a discount on what the solution typically costs.
Agent: We've worked with our global pricing team to negotiate the terms of that agreement. We would need, and it's highly critical. completed agreement by [DATE-8], oh, it says [DATE-5], but I mean [DATE-15]. I will update that.
Agent: [DATE-8] [DATE-15]. And to kind of give you some background on that, we are in the final, you know, [DATE-6] here of [DATE-13] at [ORG-2]. So [DATE-13] will end on [DATE-13].
Agent: At that point in time, we are unable to honor any of the concessions and discounts that we've applied. And there might be transitions in the teams that are supporting your organization. So reading between the lines.
Agent: You know, [PERSON-2] and I have spent in this team at large. I'm sorry guys, we should all, we should include all of you.
Agent: I've spent a lot of time getting to know each other and understanding, you know, the organization and the don't want to see you start that process over again come [DATE-13].
Speaker 5: Needs that you have.
Agent: We Does that make sense how I'm describing that?
Speaker 5: So I want to give a little bit of pause here. Right, let you kind of noodle through what's on the screen. And then I want to address any questions that you have. Well, yes, I actually have a question.
Speaker 5: So that's very general for giving us [PERCENT-5] discount.
Speaker 5: What I would like to know is that is it only for one module?
Speaker 5: For the
Speaker 5: Non-topic cloud that already, or is it
Speaker 5: For all the module that we put on the
Speaker 5: Requirement for the. Hang on. Yeah. Is it on the non-profit cloud mean
Agent: And the amount of it cloud model has already covered all the requirement that we listed. [PERSON-21].
Agent: So the nonprofit cloud and account engagement, these two solutions, right?
Agent: So the [PRODUCT-2] solution, where you're going to have that single source of truth, that full view of the individual, coupled with the Marketing solution, we are making those recommendations based off of what's in the requirements document.
Agent: So what you're seeing on the screen right now is the total investment in the software, the solution. to support what we've seen in the requirements document. What this does not include, and kind of a line of
Speaker 5: Delineation here, mostly for you, [PERSON-2], is this does not include [ORG-7]. [ORG-7] is separate.
Speaker 5: Did that answer your question?
Speaker 5: Yeah, the other one is that we'll choose charts for the number of the, a contact that we have. I learned that there's one solution on the number
Agent: That is charging us of the contact information that we have rather than the number of the licenses. Nope, not us. So our solution is based on the number of licenses.
Agent: The only time that we would run into something of that nature
Speaker 5: Is if you needed like an excessive and when I say excessive, I mean a lot of data storage. But, [PERSON-10], I don't anticipate that would be the case for you all. Okay. Okay.
Agent: So, it's, it's all those separated from the report. Sorry for the document management for example. That's also separated. I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing you, but I think that you.
Speaker 5: We can integrate the [ORG-2] with our [ORG-13], with our [ORG-13], for example. So we are not going to need one specific
Agent: Report to store you for our document.
Agent: We already have one drive. Yeah, you can integrate it with one drive and access all that information.
Speaker 5: There's a several different ways we can do it. And it really just depends on the level of access you'd like to have between the documents and the system. Yeah, thank you.
Speaker 5: Because there's not, yeah, because what I learned that there's another solution that also charting on for using the the cloud and storage. That's the problem. I think I need no further
Agent: Question for not
Agent: That's all covered. Fantastic.
Speaker 5: What are your thoughts?
Speaker 5: What is your feedback?
Speaker 5: Is this a solution that you think would work for the organization?
Speaker 5: Well, My job, my task is just to gather the information and the final decision will be my co-ed.
Speaker 5: But again, learning about, it's good to learn about your solution [DATE-1]. And it's very interesting to know about. what the workforce can give before.
Speaker 5: Because up to the Because as you learn that we really knew this [PRODUCT-2] solution and we have no, we are still learning of what we, we enhance once we have it.
Speaker 5: So by watching [DATE-21], once then we know, and we know what to do and how to make you for us.
Speaker 5: It's very informative and
Speaker 5: It helps because at first before watching your video I always have an impression that self-force is a very profit oriented especially the questioner that you shared before. It's very Marketing oriented.
Speaker 5: So we can't, I can't see a 3-4 aircraft in that environment.
Agent: So [TIME-7], I can't see that you also have a solution for the [LOC-2] organization. Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: I think that that's often the impression folks have, right?
Agent: Because we are such a large global company. But as I mentioned, and I'm glad that we were able to kind of better understand here [DATE-1] through the demo and through the presentation that
Agent: We have a huge impact on the nonprofit space with 49,000 nonprofit organizations running on [ORG-2].
Speaker 5: Any other questions on what you see here in front of you right now?
Agent: No, I have no further questions. Thank you.
EndUser: Okay. Fantastic. I'm going to stop sharing. I just have one thing.
Agent: So the agreement with [PRODUCT-5], how is that handled?
Agent: So what are the next steps to stop presenting on that?
EndUser: Well, I'm going and I was going to ask if you had [TIME-8] to hang here and have that conversation. Yeah, I can do
Agent: [TIME-9]. [PERSON-13], you. Hey, [PERSON-17], for [TIME-10]. Yes, you're. Okay. Great, great. Well, thank you for going into extra innings for me.
Agent: I can share my screen and just walk you through what based on what we've the discovery we've done so far and what we understand of your requirements, what a project could look like.
Agent: And then from there we can talk through what makes sense. What talk about project resourcing and what staffing you need.
EndUser: Doesn't I can obviously send this along. We can also
Agent: Does that sound good?
Agent: Yeah, that's great. OK, great. I'll send this along afterwards as well. So the way we break down our pricing is based on line item.
Agent: So the idea is that you can pick and choose what you want to focus on in a project. I've kind of guessed what I've guessed. I have what I think is a good phase one, but obviously we can.
EndUser: Modify this options as well.
Agent: As needed and I provide some future state I zoom in on my screen a little bit?
EndUser: Is this too small?
Agent: Should That'd be good. Yeah, that was better. Much better. Okay, great. So [PERSON-2], do your question earlier, timeline wise, it really just depends on what we choose to take on from this list.
Agent: On the short end, it could be something we do very quickly in [DATE-17], [DATE-13]. On the longer end, it might take something like [DATE-7].
Agent: But obviously, it depends a bit on your team's availability, how quickly you want to move, and what you want to take on. Some of these things are... self-explanatory, so I'm going to, like, engage in management.
Agent: I'm not going to spend time on just for the interest of the time we have left.
Agent: Obviously, the big thing we talked about, one of the big things we spoke about [DATE-1] was nonprofit cloud and getting that set up for core [PRODUCT-2] and fundraising use cases. resource mobilization being the top of the list here.
Agent: I also incorporate partner management and then gift entry donor management and then Marketing campaigns as well, which will dovetail nicely with the part outside of things.
Agent: So this would be your one stop shop for all things, contact information relations, contact and relationship management information, tracking your pipeline, tracking your leads and understanding where all that information Any questions on is.
EndUser: Thank you.
EndUser: Nonprofit cloud?
Agent: I'm OK. Should fit jumping if you have anything. No, no, I have a question. OK, one of the one of the requirements was business card scanner. There's a number of different apps that integrate with [ORG-2].
Agent: That we can take advantage of. These come from [ORG-21]. So think of like the iTunes store for your iPhone or [ORG-17] for your [FAC-1].
Agent: Place to get apps and add functionality to your [ORG-2] instance. So we would take one of those apps and install it into your [ORG-2] instance and configure it for you.
Agent: Obviously, we can work with you to pick which app makes the most sense. It would likely have a cost to it.
Agent: So something to be aware of is that apps on the app exchange generally have a cost associated with them. The other big part of the project would be setting up Pardot for communication automation.
Agent: This can be used for kind of traditional email marketing. It can also be used for programmatic communications, really any sort of email. engagement. [PERSON-13] is a great fit for the same is true for you leveraging the landing pages.
Agent: So people are coming to a particular page, you want to capture some information, help drive them towards a particular. outcome, we can keep track of that.
Agent: And then we'd set up all the lists and email templates and IP warming and all the kind of nuts and bolts things that we need to do to get an email Marketing solution set up.
Agent: And then training, we provide end user and power user training as well as documentation based on Implementation that we put together for you.
Agent: Any questions on those last two items?
Agent: No, okay. I know. Great. Integration with MyTree. I didn't get access to any technical information on [FAC-2], so this is based on building integrations with other products and custom solutions in the past.
Agent: It would be a bidirectional sync of data between MyTree and [ORG-2]. Again, I know you have very good technical capabilities in-house and maybe something your development team wants to work on.
Agent: I want to give you the option to understand what costs will look like from us. One thing that is not included above that can be is data migration.
Agent: And this cost assumes that we import contact information, relationship information, but not giving history or pipeline information, which we certainly can if needed. I never got any data samples.
Agent: I don't really know the scope of the data that you want to move over.
Agent: And then [ORG-13], this is not totally an optional thing, but social was a number, you know, came up in a lot of the different requirements that I saw.
Agent: So I just wanted to propose [ORG-13] as an option, as a social media engagement and listening tool, that a number of our clients leverage.
Agent: So, the cost of Implementation perspective, I wanted to share these numbers with you just so you have them in mind.
Agent: And obviously we can pick and choose what from the list you need, but sort of a baseline would be nonprofit cloud and part-out with training. I think it's a really good baseline
Agent: Project. And just again looking at the clock, the remainder of this document has some overview of our companies, some of our accolades, customer list capabilities. a number of different things to take a look at there.
Agent: There's also, and I think this will be a very helpful [PERSON-2] to answer some of your other questions, is what happens next section?
Agent: So if you do decide to move forward with us, what does that look like?
Agent: How do projects run?
Agent: What kind of methodology do we use?
Agent: There's also a preparation checklist, which includes things like how much time we need from each resource on your team to make this successful.
Agent: The big things for us are having a project manager on your side who is, can be our primary point of contact for scheduling and organization, keeping the trains on time, clearing roadblocks, those sort of things, an executive sponsor, and then a subject matter expert or experts, depending on how large the project is, bringing in one or more people who really have a firm understanding of what they want to get out of this system.
Agent: And these are on a [DATE-17] basis. So, spare that mind. And then ideally, we're gonna train somebody up on how to be a super user or system admin for [ORG-2].
Agent: So, we want that person involved quite a bit as well. And in some cases, [ORG-17] Manager may also be the executive sponsor.
Agent: [DATE-17] also be a subject matter expert, right?
Agent: There's not a business that have to be a clear line of delineation between each one of these people. But really just thinking about the roles related to it.
Agent: And then there's a little bit about our methodology for implementation, how we put together the data migration, project milestones, lots of fun stuff to help put you to sleep at night if you're not in love with project management.
Agent: So yeah, any thoughts, questions
EndUser: About the Implementation side of this?
EndUser: I think I might need a little more digestion time. Yeah, that was a quick version.
Speaker 5: But [PERSON-10], do you have anything off the top that we can answer quickly now?
Speaker 5: Uh, yeah, I, I, I. I have no question and
Agent: I would love to get the share of the not, if it's okay with you.
Speaker 5: Document if it's
EndUser: Absolutely, I'll send it along after the call.
EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: Thank you all for your time [DATE-1]. Yep, thank you. [PERSON-13]. Okay. Okay.
Agent: So [PERSON-2], you tell me, you know, what are what are next steps here?
Agent: I know that we had discussed that you'd have some internal conversations coming out of [DATE-1] and the presentation. And that was what lead to kind of an internal decision
EndUser: From the resource development team.
EndUser: What does that look like?
EndUser: Is that are we still on track for that to happen [DATE-18]?
EndUser: I think, well, I'm not sure how far we can get [DATE-18] with the resource mobilization team, but I think [ORG-17] and I can meet on [DATE-28] and talk it through a little bit.
EndUser: And I think, you know, I'd like to be able to come back to you on [DATE-23] with something. So whatever, you know, just to give you an update on where we are.
EndUser: But like I said, I think we need to digest this a little bit more.
Agent: And then, and come back to him [DATE-23], come back to him [DATE-23]. That would be, I think, most realistic from our side. Yeah, absolutely. We've just talked a lot at you and for sure.
Agent: Sorry, I didn't give you very much time here. And we had to go into overtime to get through even just the high level. of the implementation.
Agent: So what I propose is that we send the presentations and the information that we just showed you over for review.
Agent: I do want to flag that [DATE-23], this team, as you're speaking for you too, I imagine, will all be offline for [DATE-29] and then we'll be back online [DATE-17].
Agent: Or some of us will be back online, I will leave. Back online [DATE-29].
Agent: So if you don't get an immediate response, really if you're able to provide any feedback on [DATE-40], that would be really helpful for us going into, being
EndUser: Out of office so that we can turn around any quick questions that you have
Agent: Does that does that work for you?
Agent: Is that possible?
EndUser: I think you're [DATE-29] Yes
Agent: So you're morning right now, right?
EndUser: What's my name what day of the week is wrong?
EndUser: Are we in what is [DATE-28]?
EndUser: Okay, so
EndUser: [DATE-29] [TIME-8] is also okay.
EndUser: I mean, when we try to get back to [DATE-40], so we can go through it over [DATE-28] and try to consult as far as possible within our team and then come back to you.
EndUser: You know, if we if we have any. clarifying questions, we can try to put those down.
EndUser: But considering the holidays and everything, maybe we just do have an email exchange, and we're off for the holidays as well, so that's fine. Yeah, let's do like that. And then move
Agent: Just ahead and
Agent: Do our best. Yeah, then the window we have.
Agent: Yeah, do you think, is this doable?
Agent: I mean, just asking [ORG-18], right?
Agent: Because we want to also now and be able to prepare for
EndUser: Next steps in the process on our end.
EndUser: Is this doable by [DATE-40] that will have signed agreements?
EndUser: Is that a reasonable timeline for you guys to work off of?
EndUser: It's tight. It's tight right now.
Agent: Yeah, I think it's a little tight.
EndUser: So if not [DATE-40] than one, what is a reasonable timeline to move through your internal process and to come to a decision?
EndUser: Well, I think, yeah, this is what we need to talk about [DATE-40]. So And I do need to catch up with [GPE-2] on this. But if I can come back to you
Agent: On this as well,
Agent: The 13th is tight.
Agent: Ok. Yeah.
Agent: Was it not the 28th?
Agent: Was I am I missed?
Agent: We can stretch to [DATE-40].
Agent: That's where this is leading, right?
Agent: We can stretch to [DATE-40].
Agent: Of course, the reality is, right, that we can stretch to [DATE-40], but what happens, right, between now and then, right?
Agent: And where is that, where is like, what are the steps that need to happen in order to get us to a place on [DATE-40] where we are moving forward, right?
Agent: And I guess my real question is, Can be like,
EndUser: Those steps what's this extra time giving us, right?
EndUser: What are the steps that you'll be going through or will be going through in this extra time?
EndUser: Yeah, so what I'm guessing is, you know, we would want to hear. First of all, we need to compare this against the other, you know, proposals we have. So that takes a bit of time.
EndUser: We need to, you know, there may be some back and forth with the team.
EndUser: You know, do we want to emphasize this?
EndUser: Do we want to, you know, you know, drop something?
EndUser: Do we, you know, we need to come back to you and, you know, it's our, is our user count correct?
EndUser: Are we really happy with that?
EndUser: So those kinds of things, which will then require some back and forth between us. And then I think it's a matter of internal decision making and then taking action on that and processing contracts and so forth.
Agent: Along with your [DATE-38] holidays stuck in the middle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, totally get that. And it sounds like that's what I imagined what you would be kind of doing internally.
Agent: And knowing that we're comparing and contrasting different solutions, my biggest ask to you is we just did a hour-long presentation. We have a demo that we shared with you. In no way.
Agent: Does that show everything that this solution can do?
Agent: Okay, so I am a little bit like when I hear we're gonna be looking and comparing to other solutions that puts a little bit of a, makes my stomach turn a little bit, right?
Agent: Because I don't want you to think because [PERSON-21] didn't say it [DATE-1] or because it wasn't in a demo that it can't be done.
Agent: So as you're doing those things, if there is any sort of formal process or checkboxes or what have you, And you're like, hey, we don't think [ORG-2] can do this. My number one ask is, please ask us.
Agent: Please reach out and ask if it's possible.
Agent: Typically, the question is either yes, or because of that open and work so collaboratively with third-party solutions, we have a recommendation of something that would, a combination of solutions that would solve for your problem.
EndUser: Api
Agent: You don't become the world's number one [PRODUCT-2] solution, right?
Agent: Without being able to check most boxes and be able to have that flexibility of when we can't check a box, having a good recommendation of who can.
EndUser: Yeah, so I mean, I think that's important. And I also think it's, so I mean, I'd like to allow some time here for some back and forth so that we can, you Absolutely.
Agent: Know, cover those kinds of questions.
EndUser: So, I mean, that's, you know, critical as we move ahead, everyone's, you know.
Agent: Does it make sense for us to schedule some time, maybe [DATE-40], to kind of reconnect and go through those questions?
Agent: Does that give you and the team?
Agent: Enough time to noodle through those questions.
Agent: What is what's kind of the best timeline for us to have that conversation?
EndUser: Let me talk to [GPE-2] and we can come back to you with some times. I'm actually technically Okay.
Agent: Still on [DATE-40].
EndUser: But that doesn't mean we can't kind of keep moving ahead, but I need to talk to [PERSON-10] that.
Agent: A little bit more about
EndUser: But in general, this is the window time-wise, right?
Agent: It is. And also, it's not just, it's like the sales that I explained our timeline, [DATE-13], our transition, things of that nature. But the other component, going back to your question, I like it.
Agent: How long is this going to?
Agent: I do know that you don't want this to be like a year long project, right?
Agent: This is something that the team needs for their work.
Agent: And so it kind of, you know, like the longer we move through an evaluation, the further that completion and that Go Live date gets from us, right?
Agent: And so, and you know that, right?
Agent: I just have to say it. Okay, so my last question I had it and now it's escaping me is we talked about reconnecting in [DATE-40]. You guys are going to connect internally. Oh, I need to ask.
Agent: Has there been any further movement on the [ORG-7] that's taken place component?
EndUser: Any further decision making around [ORG-7]?
EndUser: Yeah, so these things are
Agent: Like moving in parallel. Okay. So, you know, we're taking them together. Okay, fantastic. And then when we last spoke, there was going to be some documentation you needed from [ORG-2].
Agent: So some information that the organization was going to be curious about having.
EndUser: Have you had an opportunity to kind of dive into what that might be?
EndUser: Is there a form we need to fill out?
EndUser: Is there?
EndUser: Well, I did send be in your box there.
Agent: You an email. So it should
EndUser: Oh, no.
Agent: Did I miss something?
Agent: Let me check. I mean, long before the meeting.
EndUser: It was not All right.
Agent: So, okay.
EndUser: Is
Agent: That easily?
Agent: Then still.
Agent: Well, okay. I want to follow my [GPE-3] on. All right, perfect. I will look at that and get started. I
EndUser: Have to
Agent: Drop everybody, but thank you very much for the time [TIME-1]. This lovely to speak with you. Yeah, thanks to it.
EndUser: Thank you. All right. I think we're all set here. Anything else, [PERSON-2], that you're hoping
Agent: To cover [DATE-1]?
Agent: No, this was great. I really appreciate this. Great presentation. Well, thank you so much. And I know you watched the one demo. We've got lots.
Agent: Right, so I'm happy to send additional things for you to review to give you more of
EndUser: More context around the solutions. You just kind of flag for me. I don't want to spam you. That's great. And we may come back with some questions that those be great.
Agent: Things will answer, which would you will share the two presentations Okay, that's awesome.
EndUser: And
Agent: With us.
EndUser: Take care.
Agent: We'll talk soon. Thank
EndUser: You. Take care.
Speaker 6: Okay, bye now. Good night. Good night.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They appreciated the presentation and found it informative. However, they need more time to digest the information, compare it with other proposals, and make a decision. They also expressed interest in scheduling a follow-up call to ask any questions that might arise. The customer did not express any major concerns or objections to the deal during the call.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: It is unclear if the right decision maker was on the call, as the transcript does not provide enough information to determine the decision-making authority of the participants. However, the customer mentioned that they would need to consult with their resource development team and [ORG-17] before making a decision. It was agreed upon to send the presentation and information for review, and the customer will come back to the seller by [DATE-40] with any clarifying questions or feedback. The seller also requested a follow-up meeting on [DATE-40] to address any questions and move the deal forward. The seller should confirm the decision-making authority of the participants in the follow-up meeting to ensure progress in the deal.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information on the customer's specific concerns about the seller's product. The customer did express interest in the product and asked several questions about its features and capabilities, but did not explicitly state any concerns.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""You had a lot listed in the requirements document that was so helpful. But I've tried to kind of put them into some buckets here and kind of... be able to talk through how we can help in each of those buckets throughout the rest of our call here [DATE-1].""

   The customer seemed more engaged as they started discussing the specific needs and requirements outlined in the document, indicating a growing interest in the solution.

2. ""So at the center of everything we do is that relationship management solution that [PRODUCT-2]. Does that make sense so far?""

   The customer showed increased engagement by providing positive feedback and asking a follow-up question about the portfolio management side of the solution, indicating a growing curiosity about the relationship management capabilities.

3. ""And so I think that we are aligned here, right? So what I'm hearing from you is a vision of each individual logging in and having some sort of roadmap of what they should do and spending their time on and where their priorities are, the most likely to give that kind of information.""

   The customer confirmed alignment with the sales rep's understanding of their needs, showing engagement by expressing their vision and asking about customizing KPIs, indicating a growing interest in the solution's personalized experience.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have done a better job introducing the company and its values, as they acknowledged that some of the participants might be hearing about the company for the first time.
2. The sales rep briefly mentioned the statistic that organizations who invest in their solutions are three and a half times more likely to reach their goals. However, they could have emphasized this point more strongly to highlight the value and return on investment of their products.
3. When discussing the solutions, the sales rep could have provided more concrete examples of how the products have helped similar organizations in the past, to better illustrate the potential benefits for the customer.
4. The sales rep could have done a better job addressing the customer's concerns about the cost of the solutions, by providing more detailed information on the ROI and long-term value of the products.
5. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep could have summarized the key value propositions of the products and the company, to ensure that the customer had a clear understanding of the benefits of working with them.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""What do you do with that [information collected about the individual]?"" - This question was asked to understand how the customer plans to use the data collected about individuals in their organization.
2. ""How long does that process take?"" - This question was asked to understand the timeline for the implementation of the solution.
3. ""What are your thoughts? What is your feedback? Is this a solution that you think would work for the organization?"" - These questions were asked to gauge the customer's interest in the solution and to get their feedback on whether it would be a good fit for their organization.
4. ""What does that look like? Is that possible? What are the steps that you'll be going through or will be going through in this extra time?"" - These questions were asked to understand the customer's internal decision-making process and to identify any potential roadblocks that might delay the implementation of the solution.
5. ""Has there been any further movement on the [ORG-7] that's taken place component?"" - This question was asked to understand if there have been any decisions made regarding the integration of the solution with the customer's existing systems.

Overall, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to understand the customer's needs, timeline, and decision-making process. This helped to identify the customer's intent and to build a stronger relationship with the customer.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information about any specific concerns or objections expressed by the customer that would prevent the deal from closing. The customer did express a need to compare the seller's product with other solutions and to consult with their team, but this is a common part of the sales process and not necessarily a blocker to closing the deal. The seller did mention a tight timeline and the need to move quickly, but it is unclear if this was a concern expressed by the customer or an internal concern of the seller.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific KPIs and program areas they want to focus on. Although they briefly touched on this topic, they could have delved deeper into the customer's requirements to provide a more tailored solution.
2. The customer mentioned the need for a mobile solution, but the sales rep did not explicitly address this need or provide details on how the solution would meet this requirement.
3. The customer expressed interest in learning about the portfolio management side of the solution, but the sales rep did not spend much time discussing this aspect.
4. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current challenges with their existing solutions and how the proposed solution would address those challenges.
5. The sales rep mentioned the importance of data-driven fundraising, but could have provided more concrete examples or case studies of how the solution has helped similar organizations achieve their fundraising goals.
6. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's team and their availability to ensure the proposed timeline for implementation is realistic and feasible.
7. The sales rep could have provided more information about the integration with the customer's existing systems, such as their document management system.
8. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's budget and funding for the project to ensure there are no surprises during the implementation process.
9. The sales rep could have provided more information about the ongoing support and maintenance required for the solution, as well as any associated costs.
10. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's decision-making process and who else needs to be involved to ensure a smooth sales process.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the personalized experience that the seller's product, specifically the Marketing solution, would provide. They mentioned the ability to segment their list, target the right individuals with the right message at the right time, and get the right result. They also mentioned the potential to customize KPIs and focus on program areas that are underfunded or specifically successful, as well as market analysis around giving and targets.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","The customer did not explicitly state that the seller's product meets their needs.

video_19747_167_6qr3y000000saA9AAI,"Agent: Perfect.
Agent: [PERSON-1], so. [NORP-1] look thanks very much for taking the time and remesh as well with us [DATE-1]. Just to set the context real quick, [NORP-1] you've been talking to me about them.
Agent: To us extensively about your plans in [DATE-2] to migrate to your [GPE-1] environment [DATE-1] on a physical server on Premier data center to [GPE-2]. And you've also spoken around changes from.
Agent: My windows to Linux and some other changes that you're looking at .
Agent: And I'm sure that we'll continue to have those conversations to see ho w we can ensure that the [GPE-1] environment is optimized for those plan s and how leveraging best practices that we may have had in the past .
Agent: As part of that conversation, what I also spoke to you about on a cal l a few times is around leveraging the existing footprint with [GPE-1] .
Agent: Of your investment s [DATE-1]
Agent: Main one of that [DATE-1] that I'd like to discuss is tha t advance [PERSON-2] With advanced management [DATE-1], you use certain components, but there's definitely also their value in my view, potentially in the [ORG-1] migration tool and also in the resource monitoring tool.
Agent: And you did have an ask on the call last time that we spoke around if that's something that's compatible with Azure or not. And I've just done a sanity check.
Agent: And like I said, also on the call, I thought it would be valuable. I think it's... singing for the first o f the C to get back to Californi a right now [DATE-3] .
Agent: [DATE-4], th e words remain silent an d fearful . second class presiden t I got confirmation that it will be.
Agent: So based on that, you requested that we have a kickoff meeting just to walk through what is a resource monitoring tool, how can you use it, and also will you be able to use it in your plans with the migration.
Agent: Similarly, with the Content Migration tool, we'll do exactly the same. So that's what the purpose of this call is to go through resource monitoring tool and Content Migration tool.
Speaker 5: Ok. Yep. Thanks, [PERSON-3] pretty much colors here.
Agent: [PERSON-4] I think there are [PERSON-5]. So please do keep the session as interactive as possible.
Agent: This is being recorded, so please come up with any questions that you might have, so we can address those so that your extended team will also.
Agent: Any burning questions that you might have, they might have as well and it'll be valuable for everybody I think. Bye. Over to you.
Speaker 5: Sure. Thank you.
Agent: Let me know where you can see my screen.
Agent: I'll be having lunch in the meantime. So I might remove my video rather than having showing all of the employees. I can see the standard chart.
Agent: Awesome. Okay.
Speaker 5: Yeah. We can see you.
Agent: Awesome. Let's get started. And so obviously, I have a lot of questions and I think there will be [PERSON-6] and I who mainly answer these questions. We'll kind of drive through them.
Agent: I put some slides just quickly together just as a way to pin those questions to different areas and to give us an overview, right?
Agent: Just that's all this is. So we may not need to go through all of them, but it will be probably good just to kind of set the groundwork again about what's involved in advanced management. As [ORG-2] said.
Agent: So just to set the preface to make sure everyone's on the same page, we'll quickly take [TIME-1] just to go through that and make sure we're aware. But if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
Agent: So... Obviously, you've got [ORG-3]. You know it very much well because of the external file store that you use [DATE-1]. That's one part of it.
Agent: But really, it's a collection of different applications that allow you to manage and secure your mission critical analytics at scale, right?
Agent: It really is just different parts of, you know, for the admin, essentially, to be able to go and have that scalability and that [ORG-4] and ease in mind.
Agent: And so what it includes, to be particular is not only the external file store, which is outside, which is part of that external integration, the [ORG-5] column, but it does include the resource monitoring tool, the [ORG-1] migration tool, as well as in external integrations, things like the repository being external, as well as things like turning and tuning background is and leveraging it actually a fully independent gateway, which we can get into as well if that's of interest.
Agent: But the two ones that we'll focus on, and this is usually the things that most people want to talk about when leveraging your advanced management the most, is this resource monitoring tool and the [ORG-1] migration tool.
Agent: So we'll focus on those two primarily, but if any of the others are of interest, we can, we can spend some time there.
Agent: Does that sound good?
Speaker 5: Yeah. Great.
Agent: All right. So I'll skip this one because this is just more of an overview, but you can, you know, I can share this with [ORG-6] when needed.
Agent: I've got both resource monitoring tool and [ORG-1] migration tool open on my desktop to kind of show you a live experience of it.
Agent: But just to give you a synopsis, the resource monitoring tool is all about combining different areas of the [GPE-1] utilizes to understand the performance and help of your entire [GPE-1] server.
Agent: So that includes hardware information, so how is the performance of your CPU, your memory, your disk queue, and disk space, as well as network.
Agent: But also then combine that with data that you can find in logs and repository on [GPE-1] server.
Agent: So for example, on the screen, you can see things like the concurrent users, right?
Agent: And slow view load requests, which isn't hardware specific, but it's all brought into one single pane of glass so you can see it all in the same area. And that's what the resource monitoring tool is.
Agent: It's an area for you to have a whole holistic view of your tablet server and know the health from hardware through to what the user is experiencing. So of course, performance is one thing.
Agent: You can conduct root calls analysis. I can show you a little bit about that later on, about delving into things like long-running queries. It's a good example of it. Then also, let's mention here, generate a charge back report.
Agent: Obviously, it does have an option for charge back reports, but we use that information about who's been using what to drive into that. That's resource monitoring tool at a very high level view.
Agent: We can go into more details and obviously your specific questions around it too. And then there will be [ORG-7], which we'll show later.
Agent: So what I'll do is, once they've gone for these two, I'll show you a Resource Marketing Tool very quickly, just so you're familiar again with what it looks like. And that's where you can ask questions.
Agent: And then we'll go into [ORG-8] after that. But from a high-level view, [ORG-8] is all about promotion and management of the [ORG-1] within [GPE-1] server. So again, it's an application.
Agent: It sits outside of [ORG-9], just like Resource Monitoring Tool. And it allows you, in this case, to either promote [ORG-1] within the same [GPE-1] Server, or even transform or move [ORG-1] from one [GPE-1] Server to another.
Agent: And so this is really useful if you think about, you know, defining and setting up rules for when something goes from non-production, like a [ORG-10] into production.
Agent: [NORP-2] data source credentials, for example, is a big one because typically, as we know, for within [ORG-9], a non-production is going to connect to a different data source compared to a production version of the same workbook.
Agent: So what Content Migration Tool does is it allows you to manually or dynamically and, sorry, programmatically map that transformation and that migration from one server to another. And it can then be deployed and run on a script.
Agent: As well. So that's the best part about this is that once you've built it, you can run as part of any script that you may run within the operating system level.
Agent: So I pause here and just see if there's any questions at a high level, and then we'll get into resource monitoring tool.
Agent: So any high-level questions?
Speaker 5: At the moment, I don't have anything from you.
Speaker 6: No, [PERSON-7], I will wait for details. So I will have some question on content-point question.
Agent: Absolutely, we'll get to that in a second. I'll very much skip through this because you guys know this already, but Essentially there are external integrations.
Agent: One of them is the external file store, but two others that you may or may not be aware of is the externalization of the repository, so the [ORG-11] SQL, and as well as that key management.
Agent: So you can actually manage your data and encryption keys from inside your [ORG-13] with the advanced management.
Speaker 5: So you can go ahead with the last part. The
Agent: Key manager. Yeah, so [GPE-1] has a bunch of secret keys that it uses to trust among each of the processes.
Speaker 5: And
Agent: By default, they're just [GPE-1] has its own keys, right, that it creates. and it runs it in some [ORG-13] inside of the application.
Agent: What the advanced management enables you to do is be able to manage and centralize those keys within your own [ORG-13].
Speaker 5: So you can roll Yeah, and the keys, the control over the keys is entirely with this, right?
Agent: It out. Yeah.
Speaker 5: I mean, this is something that is very useful for us. We are currently evaluating an external and encryption solution, you know, warmaker, hypertrust.
Speaker 5: But if this works, then we could probably just do away with it and use tabulars and general encryption, right?
Agent: Um, and kind of come in here and help, uh, you know, help me out where I might get this wrong, but I'm not sure if it's to do so much with encryption.
Agent: I think it's the secrets are more to do with the processes.
Agent: So if you look on the right hand side, think of like this [ORG-13] communicating with, say, the cash server or search and browse, those processes and trusting between them than it is to do with the encryption.
Speaker 5: It's more to
Speaker 5: Um, yeah.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Speaker 5: Can I clarify if I've
Agent: Got a solution?
Agent: Yeah, For it.
Agent: That's right. Yeah.
Agent: All right. And then this one, additional admin controls, really what this is to do with is more about things that you might do [DATE-1], like, for example, scaling up and out background is right.
Agent: There's a few more controls that you have in here.
Agent: One other thing that you can do as well with those resource limit controls is that, sorry, with the release of the limit controls, it just basically helps you to scale and bring it up and down as needed.
Agent: So there's a few extra, you know, a few small little configurations that you can do that are different compared to not having events management.
Agent: But then the other part that you can do as well is pull out the gateway, for example. So you know, you all know that [GPE-1] has gateways on each of its nodes. You can actually make those gateways independent.
Agent: And so therefore they come outside of [GPE-1] server and can be used as basically a front-end load balancer. I don't know how useful this would be for you guys. I think it's.
Agent: Better that you keep going with [PRODUCT-1] and keep having that external load balancer there.
Agent: But just so you know, you can take that gateway process from [GPE-1] and pull it outside of [GPE-1] server so it can basically run as a front-end load balancer for you if needed.
Speaker 5: Okay, we could evaluate this when we plan to move the load.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, it's possible, but again, you might want a more robust like [PRODUCT-1] load balancer because the load balancer for [GPE-1] is still just an [PRODUCT-2]. It'll get weird.
Agent: And so essentially, there may be something that you want more from a different load balancer, but if you, for whatever reason, want to have the [GPE-1] gateway be the load balancer, you can definitely do that here.
Speaker 5: Okay. Cool. Can
Agent: You have anything to add anywhere around the admin controls?
Agent: I mean, this is a very small area.
Agent: Yeah, it is very straightforward. I think it's just the minor feature within the resource monitoring tool. and it just adds the users within an op-amptions within the [ORG-14]. Yep.
Agent: Very basic. Absolutely. Thanks for that, [PERSON-6]. So let's jump into it then. And this is where you can definitely ask questions as I go for it. Just to surface these questions, I'll have [GPE-1] RMT up.
Agent: So this is the Resource Monitoring Tool. So again, background as we dive in and I'm sure you have your questions here. I'm logged in via browser onto the resource monitoring tools. You can see that up here.
Agent: Now, in this case, it's basically a graphical user interface. It's separate from [ORG-9].
Agent: That's the first thing we've got to remember here, right?
Agent: This isn't your login to [ORG-14] or even into [ORG-9] itself. This is a completely separate application that's installed as an agent on a separate machine. That's the first thing. I believe there was even a question, [NORP-3].
Agent: I think [ORG-2] was mentioning that, you know, can this run on, for example, [GPE-3]?
Agent: So yes, RMT can run on both [PRODUCT-3] and Linux, but it does need its own small machine.
Agent: It's not as big as a [GPE-1] server, but it needs a small machine to run the master application of resource monitoring tool.
Speaker 5: Okay.
Agent: Now, what you're seeing here is the environment.
Agent: So you're probably wondering, okay, so if this is tracking a [GPE-1] server, how does it work?
Agent: From a high level architecture point of view, there's this one master that's sitting on his own small little server, whether it's [PRODUCT-3] or Linux. Then it's obviously having to ping out to the [GPE-1] server somehow.
Agent: The way that resource monitoring tool works from a architecture point of view is that there are agents that are installed on each of the nodes of [GPE-1] server.
Agent: So each of those agents on the [GPE-1] server is what's picking up and collecting all this information and returning it back to this primary [WORK_OF_ART-1] application, right and where it stores that information for you to be able to monitor So when you install [GPE-1], so when you install a resource monitoring tool, you'll need to install it one on a separate You'll need to store the master on a separate machine that's separate from [GPE-1] server And then you'll need to install the agents on each of your nodes so it can collect the data and return it to the master So obviously that means that they need to be able to communicate with them.
Agent: And so we'd have to be within the same network as your [GPE-1] server.
Agent: Does that make sense so far?
Agent: Any questions here?
Speaker 5: No, it makes sense. No questions from me.
Agent: Ok, so let's jump in then to what you can see, right?
Agent: So I should be able to jump into here. There won't be much data here because this isn't a commonly used [GPE-1] server anymore, but it will give you at least an idea of what's collected.
Agent: So when I clicked in, I've now clicked on this tablet community performance. Think of this as just your tablet server. So in this case, this would be your ET tablet server and all the nodes included in it.
Agent: Now, what the agents are picking up is obviously information around performance and on the actual hardware itself. So you can see performance at just a general processor memory and disk queue and network level.
Agent: This is essentially like collecting information from a perf modern, right?
Agent: So we're essentially collecting information from the underlying hardware, whether it's [GPE-3] or [PRODUCT-3], to get this information so you can have it in one pane of glass.
Agent: Now, what is good, though, is that because we recognize the different processes of [ORG-9], we can actually break up some of those processes by, we can break up the hardware by those processes.
Agent: So you can see here that there would be multiple lines that show different processes based on the color legend. and see how much CPU each of those processes are using.
Agent: Same for background jobs, right?
Agent: So again, in this case, we're looking at, this is just total background jobs, I think, actually. So it's not hardware. But actually, I'll come back to this then, because this is actually not hardware related.
Agent: This is more just how many background jobs there are.
Agent: But the first two here are definitely related to the CPU and how much, you know, each of the processes are using that CPU or RAM if I were to select them that as well and see the RAM.
Agent: Any questions here?
Speaker 5: I'm good. Just one thing. I mean, I don't know how difficult or easy it is to tie activity from specific sites.
Speaker 5: If it's possible with it already, like if I really want to get a better view right now, you know, like we have a, you know, capacity based charging model, but it's not very accurate because we just looking at the concurrency.
Speaker 5: It doesn't really show how much CPU or remedy actually, you know, those concurrent users or executions are actually consuming.
Speaker 5: Is there any way to tie these?
Speaker 5: Starts to activities at a site level .
Agent: At a site level, I'll take a look and see, there should be, because I think you can see, you can definitely see Content by sites, but activity and CPU by sites I have to double check.
Agent: But to answer your question, even if we were to go further down from the site level, you can see activities.
Agent: So, I don't think the performance in the hardware goes down to that level, but you can see the activities that are tied to that performance spike.
Agent: So say, for example, I mean, there's not much here, but if I was to click on say, [TIME-2] two or one where [PERCENT-1] of it was used, right?
Agent: I can go in and find out who were the concurrent users there. So you can see it highlights on the right hand side. There's not many here.
Agent: So obviously, because no one's used it, but if there was concurrent users, I could drill in on them and see what they were doing.
Agent: So to just kind of give you an example, [ORG-13], if I go in and say... I think if I just go and say, instead of this, let me go custom and go back from here.
Agent: Let's go to a dozen. I'm just going to go back a little bit and see if we can find something better here.
Agent: It should give me a, actually I think I've gone too far back and put in a bit too much. Hold on, give me a second. That's [DATE-5] at C if that works. There we go.
Agent: Okay, now we get a little bit of stuff. Here we go. Class of days. Perfect. So if I highlight over here and I see there's a spike, it should highlight on here where the concurrent users are.
Agent: And then importantly, I can see these slow requests, right?
Agent: And this is what I was most interested in. So if I was to go into, give me a second here, I think it's in insights. I know it's not here.
Agent: Can you remember just quickly off the top of your head to get to slow low requests for individual requests, right?
Agent: That's in VisqL sessions, I think it is
Agent: Slow views being queries, that's what I was looking for.
Agent: I should be queries right?
Agent: Yeah I'll view it.
Agent: So we Yeah, so sorry could be a long way to get to your answer there But what I was trying to look at is that?
Agent: We can tie those reloads and timings to the actual dashboards and where they come in as well. So for example, all these are actually pretty normal, which has been annoying.
Agent: Usually it's nice to see something that's a bit off. It may go [DATE-6]. They're all very normal.
Agent: Ok, I'm going to choose one that's normal, but I think you get the idea that if it was sub not normal and it was above your thresholds, then it would also show. Just tick one more. No, okay.
Agent: I'll just select one of them then. So if I go and say. This one. I can see the load time. So when someone chose it and what how long it took them when they actually had it happen right.
Agent: So I can get into the details of, you know, who loaded this dashboard in this view when.
Agent: As well as, you know, what times and how long it took for each of the specific, you know, periods of time in [DATE-7]. But I can go a bit further as well.
Agent: I can see things like the VisQL sessions themselves. So you'll see there's a session idea here. And this is coming from the log.
Agent: So I can actually drill in even further to find out for a particular session, what the duration was, how long it took for the query as well as and even then also the query itself can be found.
Agent: So you can see that I can basically drill down from a high level incident. to potentially seeing the specifics even of the query itself for a load.
Agent: So I think you got it, but long story short, site I have to double check, but at least from a monitoring point of view, you can definitely get down to the granular level.
Speaker 5: Yeah,
Agent: Yeah, I think I can add on to that. I think you can configure also the incidents, for example, your slow query.
Agent: And with the slow query, I think incident type, if you move to the third type on, see, incidents you can actually configure, there's no incidents at the moment.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: So in your configuration of, I think it's under admin.
Agent: Under the admin Okay, good.
Agent: [PERSON-8]. Yeah, then I think it's global configuration.
Agent: You should be able to say incidents, how you would want to set up your queries or what level of, you can see on the second one, or the top one on the right, you can say your queries as [TIME-3].
Agent: If it passes a threshold, you'll get an incident and you'll look at the report and you'll see the details of the query and what query it is. And it's customizable how long you want that query to be.
Agent: So for example, you want to [TIME-4]. You can set [TIME-4] as critical, [TIME-3] as a warning. Then you'll flag out whichever you want. And you'll see in the incident tab. Thanks, [PERSON-6].
Speaker 5: Ok. That's good. OK. Any Not from the unknown, [PERSON-9].
Agent: Questions here from the rest of the team?
Speaker 6: No, [PERSON-10]. No, Great.
Speaker 7: Gabriel.
Agent: That's it. Yeah.
Speaker 5: No problem.
Agent: So we'll keep going. I'll jump back again.
Agent: So you can see how you can go from a high level to a very low level, right?
Agent: Now, there are some things in here that you would obviously get from any, I'm just going here, go select the environment again. Just going to here.
Agent: So a lot of this information, like you know this from [ORG-14] and you have it all in here as well.
Agent: But the value is that it's just pulling it into one place, right?
Agent: So all that information that sometimes you know when we look through log files with you or look through the repository, it's essentially just brought in here to give us so you can take action on it.
Agent: And so as kind of said, especially for incidences, you would have seen that when I clicked on global configuration, it asked me for an SMTP. Sorry. I forgot I had that up still. Let me close my WebEx.
Agent: I had it up just in case we needed it.
Agent: So coming back to this, so you would have seen that the instance is going to be set up for an email alert to be sent out to you so that when it hits and that activity happens, so say if someone at [TIME-5] takes [TIME-4] to load a dashboard and you wanted to be flagged when that happens, you get that email sent so you can come into [ORG-14] and start to explore what that query was, who the user was, and then you can reach out to them, right, to find out what exactly they were trying to achieve and what was stopping them from getting there.
Agent: So from there, you can obviously, if I just go through the activity now, you can take a look at different processes in particular. So if I go back and say, I think, past [DATE-5] it had some.
Agent: So you'll see the VisQL sessions are here. So you can actually go and see the unique VisQL sessions and come back to the session IDs like we talked about before.
Agent: But on top of that, you can even see background jobs.
Agent: So while yes, you can get a lot of this information on the admin views, again, it's all in just in one place so you can see the run times and happening here in case, you know.
Agent: There are any issues with failures of background jobs.
Agent: But what I find is really useful is data queries, right?
Agent: So this is specifically in relation to queries made of particular view. These will, when I come to here, this is just showing me all the different queries that were made recently.
Agent: But if I was to just go back to [DATE-5] to give you a few more, I'll just select this top one. If I click into it, Again, I can drill down.
Agent: So this one's a hyperfile, just so you're aware, because when you see the SQL proxy, it's actually a public, sorry, it's a published data source, I shouldn't say, not a hyperfile.
Agent: When you see a SQL proxy like this, it's a published data source, and it might be reaching out.
Agent: But you can get into it and see if you are looking at someone who's connected to a workbook and has run a query, you can see the query in here as well.
Agent: So I think, can you correct me if I'm wrong, actually, this might be a hyperfile. Let me just... confirm that if we've seen SQL proxy. Because I can see the data here.
Agent: I think this might be a, yeah, I think it might be a hyper file. That's why it comes up to SQL proxy. Yeah.
Agent: Yeah, so when it's just to give you an idea why we're seeing this, this is when a hyper file is called.
Agent: So you'll see it more as a SQL proxy because we just consolidate and run the query within the SQL proxy.
Agent: But if you were to connect to say, any other data source or database, you would see the actual underlying query, like you would in the dashboard performance monitoring when you do the recorder.
Agent: So this is really useful though, because again, if there was a slow running query, you could potentially just capture that query here.
Agent: So rather than having the end user to go back and run a performance Recording review, you just go find out when they accessed it, what time, click on it, drill down to the query and find that query right here so you can start to analyze it straight away.
Speaker 5: Okay. Yeah.
Agent: I'll jump Backup here. So we obviously looked at data queries. We've seen the view loads and the slowest views, but then also, as I mentioned, the hyper queries as well here.
Agent: Content, again, this is stuff that you might already have in the admin views, but again, it's brought into just a single pane of glass, right?
Agent: So here, what I've done is I've gone Content sites, and I'm now looking at projects in the default.
Agent: So again, To your point, [NORP-1], it doesn't have the performance of the hardware tied to it, but you can get the same information from the admin views that you can see things like what Content is in a particular project file, the number of views, number of SQL sessions in particular is useful.
Agent: But at least you can get some of that information about what's used and what's not, and understand what Content is relevant [DATE-1] and what Content may not be used and what you can clean up as well.
Agent: So similar to what you do [DATE-1], but in just one view here already set up.
Speaker 5: Yeah, perhaps we'll also take a look into these chargeback reports. I think [ORG-2] just shared a link on chat. Maybe we can take a look into this as well later.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Let's just jump into the two last ones. I'll go into chargebacks here, but instances is the last really big one.
Agent: I think this is where you'll see a lot of value for yourselves as well, is because a lot of times we look at things historically once it's happened, and it's too far behind the time of when it happened.
Agent: But in resource monitoring tool, because we have those agents, for example, so when a tablet servers down, you can actually set up incidences for things like the agent itself down, which is essentially a node down.
Agent: Changes to environment configuration or an environment down, but then importantly smaller things like an extract failure, right?
Agent: So when a background job fails and importantly those slow queries and slow views. That's what we talked about before when [PERSON-6] was saying setting up, you know, email alerts essentially for criticality of [TIME-6].
Agent: That's where you can start to see these queries and views coming in populating up, which I think is the most useful one because, you know, you know, you can see This is giving you real-time insights to what people are actually experiencing and then you can take action on it much sooner than you would having someone reach out to you to say that [ORG-13] slur.
Agent: You can be a bit more proactive.
Agent: Any questions here on incidents?
Speaker 5: Oh no, for me. Something I want to look
Speaker 7: For. No excuse.
Speaker 5: Okay, let's continue.
Agent: And then the final thing here in Resource Monitoring Tool is the chargeback report. So it's still a little bit basic, but it may help get you some information.
Agent: So if I was to, I'll just do [DATE-8] and download it. There won't be much in here, but we'll just download it anyway. It gives you a basic [GPE-1] workbook with a chargeback model on it.
Agent: And so it essentially gives you a bit of information around who's used what. And you can utilize this for your own purposes in regards to looking at the usage per site, for example.
Agent: So let me just open this up.
Agent: Can if anything you want to add while I'm just loading this up on even the charge break or anything else?
Agent: Nothing Yeah, so hopefully you got some data in here.
Agent: Specific on that.
Agent: If not, I'll just kind of explain it. There we go. That's good. So it's a very simple [GPE-1] workbook that's just tied to the data that we get inside the resource monitoring tool.
Agent: But you'll see that I've got a breakdown by environment site location or environment in site, which is, I think, what you were kind of asking towards. There's only two in here, default in [GPE-1] community.
Agent: But you can see the weightage based on things like this space usage, which probably isn't the biggest one. Refresh might be interesting as well as load time.
Agent: And we've kind of built... weightings in here, right?
Agent: So essentially, if you want to put more weighting to the charges here, you can and your cost of charge back. But again, this is just a default, an example of what you can use.
Agent: You can obviously tailor this workbook to as you need to meet your requirements. But importantly, it also has the data that you need.
Agent: So if I, I'll come back to the charge back detail in a second, but if I go in here, you'll see that all that information is in here that you can start to analyze it.
Agent: So if I want to see something like... [PERSON-9], not [PERSON-9], let's just do total view request duration in [TIME-7], for example. Break this down by location type. I know there's personal space. There's that one. Let's use
Agent: Site like we were saying, right?
Agent: You can start to see that, obviously, in this case, There's only really one site that's used here, but you would be able to see across all your different business units, you know, the total view request time.
Agent: And obviously you can get things like averages and the like in here too. But then you can also just go ahead and use the default ones as well.
Agent: So if we look at chargeback detail, or done, why is that?
Agent: And okay, give me a second. It might be that I need to click on it. So I need to click on a particular site to see it.
Agent: And then this is just a simple default usage for the chargeback for tablet community site. And we can see all those details just as a simple cross-tap here.
Agent: But again, I think what's more important is the data that comes into here that you can start to use for your own chargeback mechanisms.
Speaker 5: Okay, I mean, I just see one gap here.
Speaker 5: So if there's like peak usage period and there's resource contention issues going on, some of these views or extracts could be running longer than they usually do because some else, in that case, would probably reflect that they have longer extract refresh time or view load time, but that wouldn't really depict the actual picture of how much they would usually consume if it was a more leaner period with not so much activity.
Agent: A
Agent: The metrics
Speaker 5: I don't think there's any way That's a good to answer that question.
Agent: Question. So you're saying peak period. Background is being congested and it takes longer to run because it's because there's a lot more background jobs being run or more V request conflicting with it.
Speaker 5: Yeah, so some wrong query comes in and it's actually hogging capacity. Others are also being impacted. So it looks like their extracts are also running slower.
Speaker 5: Although usually they wouldn't run that slow, right?
Speaker 5: But because there's a congestion that would reflect poorly on that metric, load time or expect a fresh time. But they don't give it exact, you know, realistic.
Speaker 5: Picture of how much that extract how long that extract should actually be running It's actually showing that it's taking a long [PERSON-11] e because we have condition In that case, the chargeback would not be fair, right It would certainly show that, okay these guys need this extract is runnin g for [TIME-8] or so Although in usual scenarios it would run for a much lesser duration of time, right ?
Agent: I hear what you're saying. If there's conditions here as well, so I think overall you're right and you're on the right track. But that also depends on vis-ql processes being on the same node as a background or process.
Agent: So that a vis-ql, let's say a random query, comes through and takes CPU resources that may have been used for a background or process, right?
Agent: Ideally, we'd want to separate the background processes from the VisQL processes on nodes just to make sure that each node is running the jobs specifically to that type.
Agent: But you are right that if they're mixed, it might be quite difficult. But overall, you can see there's a total extra query duration.
Agent: Most of the time when there's a peak period, you find that it's actually the delay on starting the extra query.
Agent: That's the bigger issue, right?
Agent: So because there's no processes and resources available for it to run, it's waiting for that time to start running. So usually I find that when I've in the last experiences, it's the waiting time.
Agent: But maybe you've seen and maybe we've seen it, actually we have the logs in standard child that it sometimes does impact the extra query duration self.
Agent: Yeah, the extract delay is I think the main biggest culprit because of a long running one and you allow it to run longer than it's expected right before the timeout.
Agent: As long as maybe configure the longer timeout but yeah extract delay is the bigger cause of extracts that's been you know not getting out on time to the users.
Speaker 5: Pretty sure. But I know about the actual execution duration, not the wait back.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: I'm pretty sure there's a way you can see wait times in here for double check.
Agent: Extracts. Let me just
Agent: Background jobs.
Agent: I'll double check and I'll get back to you on that, because I want to spend some time with [ORG-7], but there should be a way to see some delays in here as well.
Agent: I'll double check that for you.
Speaker 5: Okay.
Agent: Overall, if there's any questions on resource monitoring for you to raise them here, but the value of resource monitoring tool is, firstly, it is a very lightweight application, so you don't need a big machine to run this again.
Agent: It's very, very small. We just don't recommend running it on the same machine as [ORG-9] for conflicts and stuff. But...
Agent: Pretty easy to set up with that and the agents, as long as they have connectivity to the top of the server.
Agent: And it really is just the alerting and the incidence is probably the biggest value here that we probably would see for you, which is you're going to be alerted more frequently to instances that you're tracking, rather than having to wait for someone to come to you.
Agent: So you can be a bit more proactive, and that's a real big value and would help you leverage a better experience for the business units.
Agent: Okay, any questions here before we get to Content Migration Tool?
Speaker 5: I'm good. I think that's continuing.
Agent: Great. All right. So, Content migration tools a little bit easier, and so I'm happy to spend a little bit. That's why I haven't given as much time to it.
Agent: But what I've got up now is a fit client, right?
Agent: It's installed on my machine.
Agent: So, Content migration tool, as I said before, just to recap is a means to transfer and migrate basically [ORG-1] from one tablet server to another, or within the same tablet server, maybe from one site to another.
Agent: But in between that transfer, there's obviously things that you might want to do. Say, for example, I mentioned before, I might want to transform a data source or change the credentials of a data source, for example.
Agent: So what the [FAC-1] tool allows me to do is to, firstly, manually kind of set up these migration plans to run when I want to move something Content from one place to another.
Agent: But also then once created, save it and be able to run as part of other scripts and processes and workflows. So what essentially happens here is you would typically open up and you'll create a plan.
Agent: I've already actually started creating a plan and logged in so you don't have to worry about that. In this case, let's say I'm moving, we could use your example, right, of moving on-premise to [FAC-2].
Agent: And so what this does is, let's take this one here, let's have that as a [GPE-1] server on-premise. And then the destination would be your [GPE-1] as your deployment. I would choose which sites in particular.
Agent: I'm looking to migrate [ORG-1] from. Of course, I can do it across multiple sites with different migration plans. So obviously, the idea is source.
Agent: Where does the Content that I want to migrate come from?
Agent: And then destination, where is that [ORG-1] going to?
Agent: And then what Content can I work with?
Agent: So first thing I have to do is select projects. So when I click on the next step, I'll fetch all the information from the source [PERSON-13].
Agent: And I get to choose if I want to migrate all projects, or look through all projects for different content, or if there's any specific projects I want to do.
Agent: So in this case, maybe I just want to use the, I have a finance one here. Let's just do industry. So everything underneath the industry project is what's of concern to me.
Agent: So I'm just going to select the industry project. Just choose banking and finance and all these ones here.
Agent: Now, once I've selected, I do have options, it's not really, it's probably vital that you figure out how you do this, but it's quite straightforward. So I will either create destination projects.
Agent: So in the destination, in this case, you're Azure, do I create new projects that don't exist, or do I copy and do I copy project permissions?
Agent: And do I also copy project credits. So it's all referenced everywhere. So the help little icons here are here. If I click on it, it should have. That's a bit weird. I have to double check on that one.
Agent: I was sure that clicked on it. There we go. There. So as if you can get a little bit of help there. So if I want to create a new destination project that I can, but I can also.
Agent: Choose options like do I want to just migrate it to an existing project as well, which we'll see in a second. So I'll do select that for now.
Agent: But let's get to the real meeting where I'm sure you have a lot of questions. So I'll start with workbooks. So the first [ORG-1] that we can move across is workbooks. The second one is published data sources.
Agent: These are the two big ones that you will probably want to move across. So when I click on selection for workbooks, I see all my different dashboards in that project that I've selected.
Agent: And I can select which ones I want to either migrate across, or I can even do it by rule based.
Agent: So if there's a particular rule process that I want to follow, right?
Agent: So in a project in particular, and then, you know, tied with something or published by someone.
Agent: I can use that little bit of information, but more often than not, people are going to select either all of them in a project or specific workbooks in a project.
Agent: Any questions here?
Agent: I apologize. I talked a little bit longer than I wanted to there.
Agent: So any questions coming up right now?
Speaker 6: Yeah, also because I have few questions in [ORG-1] migration.
Speaker 6: So you are migrating this workbook, right?
Agent: Let's assume
Agent: And
Speaker 6: Data source, then how you will manage the credential?
Speaker 6: Will you be, will it also migrate the credential as well?
Agent: Okay, I'm
Speaker 6: Asking you from why I'm asking this question. Let me tell you. Let's assume I have two environment. One is dev and prod. Okay.
Agent: And
Speaker 6: In dev, I also my data sources different dev and prod. Okay.
Agent: And
Speaker 6: In dev, I have that let's assume user underscore dev in prod users underscore prod. Okay.
Agent: How
Speaker 6: Will I move this one?
Speaker 6: So if you answer the first question, I think a second question will automatically get answered.
Agent: Yeah. So absolutely. So you can set connection info.
Speaker 6: So you'll see it let me talk that and come back.
Agent: On a click on [ORG-14]. Actually, So remember how I said that there's two passes, there's workbooks and published data sources.
Agent: So let's say you've, you know, as you're all pretty aware, You can either have the data source embedded into the workbook, or it can be separated as a published data source.
Speaker 6: In a different way, when I click on data
Agent: It's exactly the same process. So source transformations, it's for within a workbook. When I click on published data source transformations, it's in a published data source, but it's the same thing.
Agent: So I'll come back and make sure I'm here. But when I click on this, I have a few options. So the ones that are important to you are going to be things like set connection info.
Agent: So when I click on here.
Speaker 6: You might even want to
Agent: Match the criteria or you want to provide new connection. So you the criteria first.
Speaker 6: Want to match
Agent: So the data source name is a connection to a required, so it's required.
Agent: So let's say I wanted to be I'm migrating a, just a matter of [ORG-24], right?
Agent: For example, I can put in a file path and then obviously I can put, actually, and [PRODUCT-4] is not a great choice because there's no credentials there, right?
Agent: Let me get a MySQL, for example. There we go. So server port service databases and then obviously any new connection value. So essentially you match the criteria for the old connection values and then in the the new information.
Speaker 6: New connection values you put in
Agent: So that's the first one.
Agent: And then the second one you said is about safe credentials, right?
Agent: So you can apply safe credentials. So again, very similar if I was to go and choose, say, MySQL again, again, for anything, match up the details.
Speaker 6: Old
Agent: And then the safe credentials, you would give the table username and the safe credential username. And so we can put that there. So that's that one that you're seeing from dev to the prod one.
Agent: This is what you would do with.
Speaker 6: Can I have one more follow-up question on this one?
Speaker 6: Does it also have REST API or some CLI version?
Agent: Yeah, so I was going to come to that last, but I'll Absolutely.
Speaker 6: Answer it now. That's fine. You carry your flow. I was just asking out of curiosity. So flow.
Agent: Let's go to the I just... Yeah, so absolutely.
Speaker 6: It would be easy.
Agent: So we do recommend just going through the UI version once, but just to give you an idea, when you hit run migration, you can run it as part of a script.
Agent: So essentially it becomes a save file and it just runs the migration plan that you've created, right?
Agent: And you can run as part of a script.
Speaker 6: And one more, sorry.
Speaker 6: Can we do this migration from can we can we use this tool to migrate it from one OS to different OS?
Speaker 6: What I mean that if right now we are on [PRODUCT-5], right?
Speaker 6: And we're going to set up it on Unix.
Speaker 6: So can we use this tool to move from [PRODUCT-3] to Unix?
Agent: Yes.
Speaker 6: Okay, pretty straightforward.
Agent: [GPE-1], once you, no matter what you installed on [PRODUCT-3] or Linux, right, it's the inside, right?
Speaker 6: Same experience [ORG-1] is the same and all The that.
Agent: So yes, you can [PERCENT-2] migrate it from a [GPE-1] server operating on [PRODUCT-3] to a [GPE-1] server migrated on [GPE-3]. Similar like you can do a [ORG-21] and restore across them as well.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: And same goes with the data source, right?
Speaker 6: Even though the drivers would be a bit different. Right. Driver over the phone on the windows and on the unix.
Agent: The drivers will really affect the connection as long as [GPE-1] can make a connection. Because that's at this stage, what we don't care. We don't care about the drivers.
Agent: We care about the connection, right?
Agent: So as long as it can connect through that driver on instance, it should work. But yes, you obviously have to install the drivers on the [GPE-3] environment.
Speaker 6: Ok, thanks.
Agent: Now, problem. Question.
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-13], just curious as soon. Let's say if I want to rerun the same plan for some reasons, I want to rerun the same plan. Maybe I realize I accidentally admitted a source or something.
Agent: Would that work?
Agent: Yeah, you can run the same plan and even.
Agent: Even then, I believe with the plan and quickly from [PERSON-14], [PERSON-6], but if the [ORG-1] already exists on where you're in your destination from your source, then it will skip those and it will just do what's new as well.
Agent: You can even select that option.
Agent: All right. Some, I think this is not going to matter too much because I find that for you guys, it may not.
Agent: Matter too much around workbook transformations, but you know things like you can also change things within the [ORG-1] of the workbook itself.
Agent: So if people are using action URLs and the action URL has to change from dev to production, they can do that here too. So this might be useful to talk to the business units.
Agent: I doubt that dev and production will have any issues with like action URLs and parameter values, but if the business units have things in their dashboards that they need to. to make sure test and work properly.
Agent: These things might happen.
Agent: So parameter values, images that they might use, text or anything, right?
Agent: Just this is more for when you're working with the business unit.
Agent: You just want to make sure that whatever they built into the dashboard will work when they transition it over from a user action point of view, right?
Agent: So you can do a lot of this sort of configuration and transformation here too.
Agent: So what you're seeing here is exactly what I mentioned before, which was Not only are you just moving content, but especially if something were to break, right, when you move across from one two the other, such as a URL action, then you can go and make those transformations here too.
Agent: And then mapping as well. So if you just want to rename workbooks or anything, you can change those as well.
Agent: And then you also have publishing options, right?
Agent: So again, to assess question, overwrite new workbooks, copy workbook commissions, and reset dashboard selections as well. So you have those options. Now, for published data source, they're very similar again.
Agent: So again, if I was to select the published data source and then select mapping, you'll see that I can do things like rename the data source and figure out the transformations similar to what we just saw in the workbook, right?
Agent: Apply safe credentials, set connection infrow is here for these as well, and even set custom SQL. And then permissions and ownership mapping.
Agent: So again, you can get domain mapping, so Or use the mappings in there and then bring them in.
Agent: I personally find that it's just easier to manage this outside of Content migration tool because there might be more There might be more that you want to do than just move them over. Right.
Agent: Especially with, you know, as you move into a new fresh installation, you may want to kind of change those permissions and ownership.
Agent: So the recommendation is probably going to be, I would typically, for you guys, recommend that you won't want to just migrate as is to Azure using Content Migration tool.
Agent: You probably want to set up your projects and permissions as proper in [GPE-2], and then just migrate the workbook and data source content, right, to the correct projects and have them apply to the new permissioning.
Agent: But if there is a reason why you want to, move it across and take some of those permissions and ownership, you can definitely do so here.
Agent: Can I put you, would you add anything there?
Agent: I think personally that setting up permissions again on a new table server is just a little bit easier than bringing it across as is. Yep.
Agent: Definitely working on the table server makes it more straight for that might be duplicate names or something that might fail and then ending up troubleshooting and causing more delays.
Agent: Those you're mapping
Agent: Good point. Thanks, [PERSON-14]. OK, and then best part about this, as I said, you can run these scripts in a command line. But better yet, you can also run pre-migration scripts.
Agent: If there's anything you want to run before these migration and you impose the migration, you can actually have them run as part of the plan for [ORG-1] migration tool. So these are not tableau-specific [ORG-19] plans.
Agent: This could be like if I use the [PRODUCT-3] equivalent, It could be a [ORG-28] script, for example, right?
Agent: Or a command line executable. So just think of that way. If there's anything you want to do pre or post the migration, you can actually put them into the plans here.
Agent: Few options. But then again, I think I'm just going to go down to here. So again, you have now the plan. It tells me a little bit of an overview of what it does.
Agent: And it allows me to save the plan as well. So exactly what I mentioned before, if I want to save it. I can go ahead and save that now. And it saves as a TCMX.
Agent: And so what this means is I can just run this [PERSON-13] as part of a script and run that Workflow plan. So that's the best part about it.
Agent: And then if I really want to run it from inside of here, I can. But I think what will happen probably at [ORG-21] is you guys will probably want to save it and run it.
Agent: Probably a much larger process in workflow. So it's probably not going to be run by itself inside of Content Migration tool. But you can do that if needed. And that's it.
Agent: I'm happy to take any more questions that we didn't get to. But hopefully, this has given you, again, a good view of Content migration tool, the value of it.
Agent: You may not use it for all your migration needs, but at least you know it's here if needed if you want to just migrate a lot of different [ORG-1] on [GPE-4]
Agent: Again, it's an install, it's an application of fixed clients, so you install it on your laptop, and then can be used to do a lot of that heavy bulk migration and lifting and shifting from your on-premise to [GPE-2].
Speaker 6: And of course, this is again, Outlook.
Speaker 6: So, this is how the licensing and everything happens for this [ORG-1] migration tool, is it there?
Agent: It's the best part, you already have it. So as part of [ORG-13], you already do have it.
Agent: Can I find out?
Agent: I've never seen a license option come up here in Table of Content Migration Tool. But it's been a while since I looked at it.
Agent: Do you know if it should pick up the, Oh, I know why I got to answer my own question. So the reason why it doesn't need it is because when you log in, connecting to a server.
Agent: You're connecting to the server. You're
Agent: Yeah. So as long as you've got advanced migration, so advanced management licenses apply to your servers, then it's fine. You will know and will validate it.
Speaker 6: Ok.
Agent: Thanks. No problem.
Speaker 5: So [PERSON-13], would this be a better approach to move to the cloud?
Speaker 5: I mean, setting up instance on the cloud and then doing it through the [ORG-1] migration tool, or do you think like just backing everything up and deploying it on the cloud?
Agent: Yeah. So that's a good question. And I think, you know, there's values to both.
Agent: I think overall the the full [ORG-21] and restore is probably going to be a lot easier because there's a lot of other [ORG-1] information that you can get in there, right?
Agent: But if there's, say, if you're testing or you see something is a little bit off, this might be a quick way just to move certain migration and certain workbooks over, for example, or certain data sources.
Agent: So think of it almost like an ad hoc tool that you could potentially use as part of that migration process if anything's missing or if there's an issue and you want to confirm and post me across.
Agent: I heard a hand raise.
Agent: Jw here, just kind on that same question and just a nuance on that one is, you know, the quantum migration tool, you know, it looks point, yes, you can just do, you know, set it up in the cloud, and then make your work and then just transfer it right and do it Backup there.
Agent: But you might also not want to migrate everything, right?
Agent: Because when you migrate everything, you do it like when you move house, you know, you end up throwing a lot of stuff away and <inaudible> that you actually built up over [DATE-9] that you've been doing.
Agent: What am I still doing moving that to, right?
Agent: No, it was not of value here.
Agent: Why am I moving that over there?
Agent: Whereas [LAW-1], you can enable you to select things to set up correctly in one go. And B, you probably will want to do a migration slowly.
Agent: Sometimes you might want to just set up a few processes first, that's how that goes and then migrate it slowly over to the other thing.
Agent: How do you see that?
Agent: And either way, even if you do migrate it that way, the quantum migration tool also has other value beyond just purely the migration to the cloud, right?
Agent: There's also other things that you can do with it.
Agent: Well, I was just going to add quickly. even if you don't use it for the initial migration, you could set it up as a means to migrate Content programmatically from a [GPE-2] non-production environment to the production environment.
Agent: So this could be the way that you [ORG-21] processes of workflows for publishing.
Agent: So say, for example, a good use case that I've seen before is if you have a project on your non-production that has approved workbooks for production. You could put them there throughout [DATE-10].
Agent: And then [DATE-9], essentially, a [ORG-1] migration tool script runs and pushes those workbooks that are in that project for approval, sorry, that are approved, up into your production environment.
Agent: So it can actually be used in a lot of the day-to-day processes of promotion and of content. So that's just one way. It really helps beyond and after the actual initial migration Yeah, okay, makes sense.
Speaker 5: Very relevant for us now right now because I don't know if we are operating in a very, very self-service kind of mode. There's not much [ORG-30] going on.
Speaker 5: So there's no like approved workbooks or anything in non-prote that we promote.
Speaker 5: They just build stuff directly in production nowadays, right?
Speaker 5: Yeah.
Agent: Right.
Agent: But the thing is, this is where you could start to put some of that governance into place, right?
Speaker 5: So if you want to know, Yeah, yeah.
Agent: Absolutely.
Agent: So I think especially when you're moving to [GPE-2], my recommendation would be start thinking about these things because it's a great point in time where you can start to apply these and say, look, we're going to do things a little bit differently.
Agent: And this is how we're going to do it.
Agent: So if you start thinking about outside of the technical of TELO, but what does a Workflow process look like for promotion or content?
Agent: This is when start thinking about it and you can then use things like Content migration tool as part of a much larger Workflow there. Yeah.
Speaker 5: I think let's look into this. So I think my primary concern is we are making two hops. When we move to the cloud, we're actually moving from [PRODUCT-3] to Linux and then moving from on-prem to the cloud.
Speaker 5: Right?
Speaker 5: I think it would make sense for us to try this out while moving from [PRODUCT-3] to Linux on-prem.
Speaker 5: Of course, it will not be the same sized cluster, but it'll give us an idea of how well it works, right?
Speaker 5: Moving from the Linux. And then if it works well, then we just take the big hop from on-prem to cloud.
Speaker 6: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: That's it. So very simple. to download it, just like we're telling this up, you download it as a tool. So you might need to get it approved internally to see or anything.
Agent: But let me, what's the download location?
Agent: That was the install. It should be on [GPE-1] downloads. So it should be with all the other downloads. So you know where we have Support releases. I'll just go to this one for desktop.
Agent: But we should have here advanced management. And then you'll see underneath events, mentioned if I go, for example, here. It's going to ask me to log in.
Agent: But underneath the download products, it should be here and located here as well. So that's where you can download the [ORG-1] migration tool and start working with it [DATE-1].
Speaker 5: Okay, Look at the startup.
Agent: Cool.
Speaker 5: We have onboarding for this tool.
Agent: And most importantly, what's important to realize is that you can use both these tool [DATE-1] and in your end state, regardless of whether it's on the windows or [GPE-3], regardless of whether it's on physical prem or in [GPE-2] cloud.
Speaker 5: Okay. Great.
Agent: That's all I have here. JW, I'm going to pass it all back to you.
Agent: Well, thanks very much, [PERSON-13] for that. Really appreciate it. And thanks for the questions to the [ORG-9] team as well.
Agent: Any, I mean, I think maybe what I'll do from here is I'll share the Recording that we've done [DATE-1] via the Ignite link that we had.
Agent: And then I'll send it over to [PERSON-13] so that here, at least you're able to download it and distribute it internally as you see fit.
Agent: And I also will then touch base of the program at the latest stage to see, you know, if and when and how you'd like to consider leveraging this the remote monitoring tool is something that we've discussed.
Agent: For a while and it's, you know, when we were in [GPE-5], he said, yes, it is going to become priority in [DATE-11].
Agent: Really because we want to move a little bit more to a little bit more proactive view of what's happening in your environment.
Agent: And [PERSON-13], I'm also more than happy to kind of set up a workshop if you see value in that with our blueprint team to talk to the best practices around chargebacks and wishing other customers doing and just providing insights into what you'd like to see.
Agent: And we can talk about that. And yeah, that's it for [DATE-1].
Agent: Any feedback, [NORP-1] that you'd like to share here in that, or would you like to digest it?
Speaker 5: Yeah, I mean, this was a great thanks, [PERSON-13], for that walkthrough.
Speaker 5: Yeah, there's a couple of things that we want to work on, right, [ORG-2]?
Speaker 5: I mean, it's not just the chargebacks.
Speaker 5: I think our look is leading the effort on this [GPE-3] migration right, I think priority for the entire organization right now is this cloud migration, right?
Speaker 5: So what we'll probably want is to have another session, maybe on this migrating to Linux. I think that will also something we discussed at [ORG-2].
Speaker 5: At the moment, at least, we are in a very nascent phase, so we don't have too many questions. But I am assuming that some issues will pop up time to time.
Agent: And this is critical for
Speaker 5: Us to fix before. Because on the Cloud, it's going to be Linux that's pretty much a short, and we also have received all the answers.
Speaker 5: Approval so work on this migration is going to start I think by [DATE-13] . but apart from that, yes, definitely RMD is a priority .
Speaker 5: Would say a lower priority than moving to the cloud because that's where we have a ver y stringent timeline to meet. So we'll evaluate this and once again, thanks [PERSON-14] for that walkthrough .
Speaker 5: Also share this with a couple of other folks who work on [PRODUCT-6] with our tea m so that I think it will be helpful for them as helpful election [ORG-28] d. W reacting a bit handy tod ay to make sure that he 's answered some of t he resources hearanized in
Agent: Yeah, so just on that, [PERSON-13], I think obviously the reason why I suggested remote monitoring pool is actually migrate to the cloud.
Agent: You'll want to have a bit of an understanding of benchmarking of current performance and the current environment.
Agent: And then when you migrate over, you want to do another one of those benchmarks to see how things improve to the gotten worse and so forth. So you can then help big down into what worked and what didn't.
Agent: Hence why I think that they are tied to get it to some degree. . As it relates to the [GPE-3] workshop, we are more than happy to have a meeting with you guys.
Agent: And what I think might be useful to start off with if possible, and I'm not trying to give you guys homework.
Agent: But it would be to, if we can have [TIME-9] where you present to us what your plans and ambitions and full processes for [DATE-13], then we have a bit of an understanding of this is the priority.
Agent: This is where you want to end by the end of this candy year. And these are the activities.
Agent: And then based on that, we can then see what actions do we need to consider and what ca n we come to you with to help you address those priorities Specifically as it relates to a [GPE-3] workshop, I mean, you know, more than happy to get o n a call, but I think it's what's more important to start with is understand what kind of question s you have so that when we show up, we show up .
Agent: Prepared and really trying to address any questions you might have.
Speaker 5: Okay, yep, that makes sense. So I think we have a book of works. See, cloud is going to take up at least two quarters. Okay.
Speaker 5: It's not going to be easy because it's the entire data lake, which is my reading, right?
Speaker 5: We have to wait for all of these, you know, T3 consumers as well to move their stuff to the cloud. Okay.
Speaker 5: It's going to be a very long and painful exercise, but yes, we do have a couple of other things as well that we want to do [DATE-14].
Speaker 5: Let me come up with a list of all of these priority items and maybe we can take it up, you know, you and not.
Agent: Yeah, it's always good to have a bit of an alignment on this is where we're heading in [DATE-14] that will let you know we're working on and that way we can start to look at [PERSON-24] say hey these are kind of working on this.
Speaker 5: And these are the major things
Agent: What kind of things can we bring to the table to help them proactively. And then up to you obviously to see where you think you might or might not need help from proactively.
Speaker 5: Okay, yep, makes sense.
Agent: How can I have a
Speaker 5: Look on this and we'll come up with a list?
Agent: That's right. Thank you all for your time. Really appreciate it. Again, thanks [PERSON-13] for your presentation and I look forward to hearing you
Speaker 6: Soon. Thank you.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you. Bye.

2. The sales rep asked if the Content Migration Tool had a REST API or command line interface version. The customer seemed more engaged as they asked about the possibility of using the tool to migrate data from one operating system to another.
3. The sales rep asked if the customer had considered using the remote monitoring tool to benchmark their current performance and then compare it to their performance after migrating to the cloud. The customer seemed more engaged as they discussed the importance of understanding the performance of their current environment before migrating to the cloud.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were:

1. Migrating from their current operating system ([PRODUCT-3]) to Linux and then moving from on-premise to the cloud. They wanted to try out the migration tool while moving from [PRODUCT-3] to Linux on-premise to get an idea of how well it works before taking the big hop from on-premise to the cloud.

2. Chargebacks and cost management in the new environment. They discussed the need to understand benchmarking of current performance and the current environment, and then when they migrate over, they want to do another benchmark to see how things improve or get worse.

3. The customer also had concerns about the timeline for moving to the cloud, mentioning that it's a high priority for the entire organization and is set to start by [DATE-13]. They also mentioned that the cloud migration would not be easy, as it involves migrating the entire data lake and waiting for all T3 consumers to move their stuff to the cloud.

4. The customer expressed interest in a workshop to discuss best practices around chargebacks and learn from other customers' experiences. They also wanted to understand how the seller's product can help them address their priorities specifically.

5. The customer mentioned that they are currently operating in a very self-service mode, with little governance in place. They expressed interest in setting up some governance, such as using the migration tool for promoting content from non-production to production environments.

6. The customer had some questions about the [ORG-1] migration tool, such as how it handles credentials when migrating data sources and whether it has a REST API or CLI version. They also asked if the tool can be used to migrate from one operating system to another, like moving from [PRODUCT-3] to Unix."
video_19748_167_6qr3y000000sZs4AAE,"Agent: Perfect. So for [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2], you know, thanks, thanks for the time. We've spoken to some members of the extended team and [PERSON-3] as well. We've spoken to some members of the extended team.
Agent: The new face on this call [DATE-1] is [PERSON-4]. So I want to introduce them. [PERSON-5], do you want to kind of give your title a little bit of background before we kick us off.
Agent: Sure, I'm relatively new to [ORG-1]. Been here [DATE-2] now. I'm the, I had a technical architecture for the [ORG-2] team.
Agent: I joined [ORG-1] from imply a real-time [ORG-3] source on top of [LOC-1] database provider, where I was the chief customer officer and worked at ITRAN prior to that.
Agent: So I've got [DATE-3] in the data space and really happy to be here and talk with y'all today and very nice to meet you.
Agent: So [PERSON-1], we spent some time, thanks [PERSON-5], we spent some time [DATE-4] going through previous meetings and some of the some of the things that we felt did not land very well.
Agent: And I think that [DATE-1] we've got a very good.
Agent: Overview of the one, the Einstein one platform, as well as [ORG-2] and the consumption piece, because that was one of the things that was top of mind for [PERSON-2] was to understand some of the consumption piece.
EndUser: I'll pause there to see if you've got any questions or
Agent: Additionally that you want to cover.
Agent: Looks like he's got a fire drill.
EndUser: Now it was [PERSON-6] on this invite.
Agent: Let me check. Let me forward it to him. If not,
EndUser: I thought he was. Yeah, he just texted me about it, but I don't see him in here.
Agent: Here, I'll forward it to him right now.
EndUser: Okay, thanks. Okay.
EndUser: That's all right. We keep going. Sorry. No, no, you're good.
EndUser: So, I mean, with that agenda of the one on time platform, the overview of [ORG-2] and the consumption model is for anything else that you wanted to make sure that we touch on [DATE-1].
EndUser: I guess I the [PERSON-2], where do we stand on the zero copy?
EndUser: So [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-8] and I talked a bit about that [DATE-4]. Got a little bit more clarity on how the credits draw down.
EndUser: So [PERSON-8], I think that just talking about next steps with what we need to do on the [ORG-1] side, I think we have a good idea what to do on the Snowflake side, but what we need to do on the [ORG-1] side to get all of those components enabled.
EndUser: And communicating so that we can go ahead and build streams. That's maybe more technical than we want in this, you know, in this, uh, in this forum.
EndUser: Um, but if we could just nail down what the next steps are, who, who we need from our side is that like [PERSON-9] and [PERSON-10] is that, you know, is there, is there another contractual piece?
EndUser: I think we got the PO like just for that kind of basic, uh, credits. Um, but, but then [PERSON-1] from, from there. We'll be able to build an estimate of credit usage, and then that's probably going to
EndUser: Lead to some conversations about what our strategy is moving forward. So here's my issue on this one, [PERSON-2]. So we're working with consulting group called [ORG-4], and they're helping us stand up the whole Snowflake ecosystem. Thank you.
EndUser: We're kind of at the point where we're ready to really start tackling our first use Cases in the new environment, right?
EndUser: And what's not clear to me if we're relying on a five-tran model to keep the sales force data in Snowflake or if we're relying on zero copy.
EndUser: And I guess someone could tell me, I don't need to worry about that and maybe I won't worry about it. But I guess I've been feeling like we needed to get that locked in before.
EndUser: Because I expect, I mean, [PERSON-2], the [DATE-5] is kind of the, it's go time on the first use case, which is heavily leveraging
EndUser: A lot of the [ORG-1] data. Yeah, so I would say worrying about it is probably not an unreasonable thing to do.
EndUser: But I wouldn't worry too, too much about it because the ability for us to pivot should, at a theoretical level, shouldn't be too much of a lift.
EndUser: And an aim point is very much in favor of the zero-copy model as well. But that's where we're kind of, we're still a little bit like, okay, what very tackle.
EndUser: Sorry, what very tactically do we need to do in sales force to get [WORK_OF_ART-1] stood up connected so that we can go ahead and start building streams. That's the part where we're a little bit unclear.
EndUser: This is the pieces that...
EndUser: So the zero copy solution is dependent on [ORG-2] or not?
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: The five-trans solution is dependent on [ORG-2] or not?
EndUser: It is not.
EndUser: So that's where like, I start to start wondering on, so does it become a question of, let's obviously there's functionality and like how well, you know, time, latencies, all these things, but then there's cost like, because we're talking about Data Cloud credits.
EndUser: And then we're also talking about what it costs to move data in five trend, right?
EndUser: Correct.
Agent: So like, I guess the worst case is I don't want to end up paying for something twice. No, you don't want to do that.
Agent: And again, I started up the customer success group at five grand [DATE-6]. So very familiar with their product, what it does, how it works.
Agent: And do you all use five grand for anything else [DATE-1]?
EndUser: We will be. We're not using it right now, but [NORP-1] is also going to be kind of central to our strategy to get things from our SQL transactional data. Absolutely. I can talk about their pricing model as well.
EndUser: I was actually on the team to put it together for [DATE-7]. So [PERSON-1], I think right now [NORP-1] is a very well-known quantity.
EndUser: What's kind of an unknown quantity right now is on the zero copy side of it. And so it's not so much that it's going to be we're going to pay for it twice.
Agent: It's like if we, whatever we use zero copy, clone for and use that credit drawdown, then we would turn off that component of five trans.
Agent: So it's not like we're going to be double paying and we would save on the consumption. And I can, uh, I can address also what it takes to get that set up.
Agent: Um, I'm actually working and I can share their name because we have a partnership, but I'm actually working with Snowflake right now on that where there were like, swing their, uh, five training.
Agent: Many, five for in for many other things. Yeah.
EndUser: So [PERSON-8], you asked for other things, and this kind of started this conversation.
EndUser: Is that what you were thinking of asking about or not really?
EndUser: No. So [PERSON-1], let me chime in here.
EndUser: So I think we've spent a lot of time on that piece, and we've kept, we've got [PERSON-5] and the team who can speak to the tactical pieces for getting that set up. Really our intent [DATE-1] was,
Agent: We've spent a lot of time with [PERSON-2] and his team, a lot of good time really on those first steps of like kind of the solution architecture, if you will. Zero copy.
Agent: Streams, ETL type processes And we haven't really.. .
Agent: I think taking it far enough or if we have, we haven't really gotten a whole lot of good feedback, I think, on the use Cases to really see the solution through. So we're fine with the zero copy model.
Agent: So we really want to take that a little bit further and get yours and [PERSON-2]'s and [PERSON-6]'s feedback on how this kind of comes to life, both with [LOC-2] and the Einstein 1 platform.
Agent: And maybe it may as well with your... So this I...
EndUser: The solutions that we're looking at are not delivered through [PRODUCT-1] right now.
EndUser: I guess that's... We are looking at the solutions that we're working with [ORG-5] on are to deliver to get everything into Snowflake and then to deliver through the Snowflake paradigm.
EndUser: So at this point, the use Cases we're working on are not, we're not looking to deliver them in data cloud. I don't know, I don't know what I just said, make sense or not answers your question.
EndUser: I'll be honest, the use Cases that we're really chasing with, whether it's zero copy or five tram plus Snowflake is.
Agent: I don't know.
Agent: Do you guys want to run this meeting or do you just want to?
Agent: I don't I don't want to take this down paths that you didn't want to go down. But I personally love to hear about the use case. That's really a big thing that we want to talk about.
Agent: The fundamental problem at its root and I don't not look into pick
EndUser: Too many scabs is that lightning in [ORG-1] ends up being significantly less valuable for us than we imagined.
EndUser: The reason being, I'm just going to say the number of objects involved in what we typically report on is more than lightning can accommodate.
EndUser: So as we're going through the implementation, what we thought, let's say we thought it was going to be an 92-16 mix, lightning at [PERCENT-1], and then [PERCENT-2] kind of [ORG-6].
EndUser: Really almost probably flip-flopped, especially when we got into the service arena.
EndUser: And so there's just a whole lot that is not deliverable through lightning or it creates a very untenable user experience because you have to use multiple reports what we wanted to deliver through one.
EndUser: And it mostly comes out to limited. And then I would say as we got into [ORG-6], we have struggled mightily with the recipe process. Not as much with [ORG-6] as a presentation tool. As a presentation tool, it's fine.
EndUser: But I mean, I'm not saying anything, [PERSON-2], and I haven't talked about a bunch of times, and you shouldn't be a surprise to the folks who've heard us talk. We have, the recipes get out of hand.
EndUser: Like, and you end up, we end up almost not one two one, but we have hundreds and hundreds of recipes at this point, I believe, I believe it's well over 96 [PERSON-2]. Yeah, it's a bunch.
EndUser: And the intention was that we were supposed to be reconciling those recipes into what we called foundational data sets, where a lot of [ORG-6] visualization could be delivered off the same data set.
EndUser: And I'm not prepared and maybe [PERSON-2] could if you guys really wanted to hear it. But the [ORG-7] recipe process, I would just say we're pretty I'm pretty much out on. I'm kind of done with that.
EndUser: And the answer where we're going is snowflake. So between four trans [ORG-8] to handle all the load transformation stuff. that in effect the recipes have been doing for us.
EndUser: Now, if anybody, somebody from the [ORG-1] side wants to try to correct my fundamental understanding of the building blocks, I bet the recipe tooling has become very untenable for us. Our people struggle with it. It's not scaling.
EndUser: Our business users are very frustrated. We're not very productive with it. We've repeatedly had to go get Professional services to come in and even they're not very productive with it. So that's the use case.
EndUser: To the point where some of our people got loose on [PERSON-13] and we're going around the recipe processes and it built a bunch of business critical, what I'll call ETL style things in [PERSON-13], just to get around the recipe process.
EndUser: That's undesirable too. And so the use case that we're tackling is to deliver what are some mission critical sales executive reports, very busy reports. We got to unwind them from data [PERSON-13].
EndUser: We got to unwind them from the recipes. and we need to bring in data from other sources. So that's the first primary use case, and to me, that's the summary of how we got here.
EndUser: I think that's the kicker, [PERSON-1], is the other data sources.
EndUser: I think that we're in some Cases without the use of data cloud, trying to do too much with some of the the native [ORG-1] stuff and that's where we're getting a lot of the friction.
EndUser: And that's again why I think that the strategy moving forward of doing that in a data platform that is meant to aggregate data from in number of sources is going to be a good path forward.
EndUser: But yeah, I would agree totally with that assessment.
Agent: Yeah, and that is a big part of the strategy with [PRODUCT-2] copy or just open access into other data ecosystems like Snowflake or big query or AWS data bricks as well.
Agent: Right, whether people already have a lot of assets there or what you just described, you're going to be building this, but that open access to enable all of the different potential consumers to be able to make use of the data that exists in multiple places across a federated data stack really opens up a lot of capabilities for you.
Agent: Or, as I say, using a principle modern data architecture, it's people.
Agent: Things or preferring to work in different areas where they can be most productive and a good open federated data system is designed to Support that.
EndUser: And kind of on on the at the risk of taking this conversation maybe even further away from what the intention was but you tell me if it's too far away but I'm starting to hear there even some new From the [ORG-1] side, there's some new capabilities with [GPE-1] and this Tableau Embedded Architecture and things like that could end up helping us to solve some of these problems on top of the snowflake.
EndUser: And so, you know, I don't know, again, it sounded like maybe the original intent for this meeting wasn't necessarily to go deep into, you know,
Agent: [PERSON-13] into this use case, but kind of like [PERSON-1]. No, it actually was. So, we had an analytics use case prepared. And so maybe [PERSON-5], maybe you can start with some of the presentation.
EndUser: Because [PERSON-1], we had kind of a, we're calling it kind of an analytics use case. And that's one, that's a common one we see with [ORG-2] in our solution stack.
EndUser: So maybe we can get into that because we had a couple others, one kind of like related to customer health, one related to marketing, kind of like a prospect experience and tie Workflow to that.
EndUser: So maybe we start with the analytics and just the solution architecture, what we prepare there and I'm sure you'll have some more questions. Okay. I mean, that's fine.
EndUser: And this has kind of been the ugly truth between me and [PERSON-2]. There's a lot of future use Cases that people want to talk about.
EndUser: We have not paid off the fundamental value prop from [DATE-8] on why we moved to [ORG-1]. And a lot of it is tied to the lack of the analytics.
EndUser: Had to do it over again what I know now. probably would have come out that I would not have relied on [ORG-6] at all or what at the time was called.
EndUser: I don't even know if it was [PERSON-13] plus [ORG-6] plus CRMA Einstein you know I think it's changed several times but that was definitely the weakness in our purchase three [DATE-8] and I wish we had gone basically [PERSON-16] out the gate for all the operational reporting.
EndUser: And that's, that's, and I don't know if it's going to be [GPE-1] sitting on top of snowflake.
EndUser: I mean, I guess we're going to, the intention is that all of our [ORG-6] presentation, because we have built hundreds and hundreds of presentations through [ORG-6].
EndUser: I think the intention is we now have developed a fairly rigorous [ORG-6] presentation capability, but we still struggle mightily with the recipe side and the data sets.
EndUser: So I think the intention is that we'll be able to point all these [ORG-6] presentations hopefully t o the Snowflake data source.
Agent: Yeah. That's actually what we prepared [DATE-1]. Okay. [PERSON-1]. So you could swap the visual layer for [ORG-6] with [GPE-1]. It's two different layers with some different capabilities.
Agent: So let us walk through that and then we can answer some, get some more feedback from you if that's all right.
Agent: Yeah. One thing I'd say before, before we jump into a demo is as we said we've
Agent: But all I'll say is that what we were trying to show across all of those, but we'll focus on looking at the analytics, is that's what's top of mind for you, is that [ORG-2] working along through zero copy, and also what we call bring your own model.
Agent: If you have any [PRODUCT-3] initiatives using [ORG-9], [ORG-10], or others, we Support through Data Cloud multiple different data workloads. And again, I say through data cloud, it does.
Agent: It means that the data has to exist in data cloud, but it can be accessed through Data Cloud to other systems. And those are analytic predictive generative . application enriching and automation data workloads.
EndUser: Can you describe at a very strategic level, high level, what is the intended sales force relationship with Snowflake?
EndUser: Like between Data Cloud and Snowflake, is it?
EndUser: Are they competitive platforms or are they symbiotic platforms?
EndUser: No, we absolutely see them as symbiotic platforms.
Agent: Symbiotic platforms. And like I said earlier, Snowflake is implementing data cloud, sales forces implementing Snowflake, and both of those will have both [ORG-13]. So before we show demos, like, so
EndUser: I've kind of pontificated a little bit on our experience. This is what I'm saying surprise you guys when you look at the ecosystem of where we've landed. Or are you like, okay, I get it.
EndUser: I get it why we're here.
Agent: I mean, I would venture to say, to some my knowledge that I would question kind of the foundational build of the object model that led you to [ORG-6] going astray and like what was actually fundamentally built.
Agent: Because that may have caused some of it, but it may be too late or like we've already built that, we made the decisions that you did. And that's probably gotten you to the step you are.
Agent: But we have like a lot of customers where their environments are complex. And so between our variety of solutions, usually have to accommodate our flax to that. So it's not uncommon that we have complex environments with customers.
Agent: I would venture to say just your [ORG-6] pain is probably from just like the foundational build with the object model.
Agent: And we're not going to, we're not here to solve all that, but like, we were really dig in and re-look at all that.
Agent: I'm venture to say we probably could find some areas for improvement with it that might address the [ORG-6] pain, but I'll hold out for that for now.
Agent: From my perspective and data, I can say it's without knowing [ORG-6] deeply yet. being relatively new here, thinking about [ORG-6] and those foundational models.
Agent: To me it seems a little bit like working with [WORK_OF_ART-2] to kind of democratize out the ability two form datasets that you can build hopefully really valuable analytics on top of.
Agent: And you know folks who have used [WORK_OF_ART-2] a lot in the past, I've heard many similar stories. from that.
Agent: So from just an architectural perspective, that approach, I've heard of similar stories where you really get sort of spaghettiing out of a lot of different foundational things, which is funny because when we say foundation, it should mean foundation and a house doesn't have any different foundations.
Agent: It has a foundation. So anyway, I'll bring it up there.
Agent: So, [PERSON-5], did we want to go ahead and get into some of the use Cases that you were going to, or the use case, we were going to around analytics that you were going to show Yeah.
Agent: [PERSON-7], you want to get in there and show that. And then I can move on to the little presentation bits I have. And I can focus on zero copy and [ORG-2] together.
Agent: And it's not really a comparing and trust necessarily. And it's five-trans-no-flight. They're really, [PERSON-2], as you mentioned earlier. You don't have to use both. It's kind of one or the other.
Agent: And you get a lot of similarities there between the two. And there's some advantages with [ORG-2] that I'll go into.
EndUser: Seconds. Here we go. Let's take a just sharing.
EndUser: So the quick use case, and this is kind of to build off of what [PERSON-5] was saying, was when we look at [LOC-2] from a foundational perspective, those data workloads that we talked about are really intrinsic to everything that [ORG-1] is trying to do as we move forward.
EndUser: So one of the ones that we were talking about in this really quick example is more so both the marketability ingestion.
EndUser: So whether your data is sitting inside of say [PERSON-13], you can share it over with connectors to [LOC-2]. to make that data accessible to multiple modeling tools .
EndUser: [PERSON-5] said, you can use some of the model s at [ORG-1] leverages .
EndUser: Can use models if you want to build your ow n and [ORG-9] using your own intrinsic knowledg e and your specific secret sauce, if you will .
EndUser: What we were talking about is [PERSON-17] e of the analytic use case is for this engagement [ORG-13] e that you're seeing here, our [ORG-13] level is basically saying , we can go through an action against this person .
EndUser: Data. So we can say this [ORG-13] score has increase d. Now it's not just a visibility. It's not just hey, it's in a dashboard. It now can actually have automations actioned against it.
EndUser: So how the automation can affect the app is for this simple use case We can talk about it automatically creates a task for our agent to send an email now high level You could automate this whole thing.
EndUser: So once the [ORG-13] score went above 77 You can have an email sent out you could leverage Marketing tool. You could leverage sales forces email as [PERSON-13] said kind of that [DATE-9] doesn't really matter.
EndUser: You can expose this data into the tools that make the most sense for you . when we have it sending a letter to [PERSON-18] here, if I go in, I can show you [PERSON-18]'s record .
EndUser: We have our engagement history. We can see specific calculated insights again can b e powered by the Data Cloud back end.
EndUser: But the main goal here is being able to make sure that we ar e actioning as well as using prescriptive technologies.
EndUser: So that prescriptive aspect is that sentiment score or that [ORG-13] score that you want to build off [NORP-2] So yes, it takes into consideration [ORG-1] dat a, but the outside data sources as well are releva nt and something that we were not able to do with just core [ORG-1] kind of utilization in the pas t. So when we look at that automated ability to go through, create the task or to automatically send the email out to [PERSON-18], we then are now enabling, as we talked about really briefly in the beginning, the Einstein one platform is we're taking the data aspect and using it across all of the [ORG-1] applications, but more so into our artificial intelligence sphere.
EndUser: So that's where inside of our, Hey, we should send an email regarding [ORG-13]'s new score. It's a great time to do engagement.
EndUser: The agent now has that ability to come in and say, I'm going to go through and actually generate an email. And that's where we can through prompt builder.
EndUser: Or as I'm going to show you here, this is a co-pilot that's getting released [DATE-10]. You can actually empower your internal reps to be able to create those email contents.
EndUser: So a good way of looking at this from a value use case is if you're onboarding new reps, as new people are starting to use the tool, those who don't have the tenure to look back on to be able to see.
EndUser: Say, hey, I know exactly the type of emai l that I should be writing We can actually go through and actually have them prompt hey, draft an email And this is the generative technolog y that can underlie and use some of those component s that [LOC-2] has provided, such as that sentiment score to kick off and start doing the generative activities .
EndUser: So when we look at Einstein one platform, there's a lot of, I like to say that the value prop that [ORG-1] is bringing is that we are not trying to pigeonhole you into a specific technology.
EndUser: Our goal is to be as open as possible. You want to use five trend. You want to use other models. You want to bring your own model. All that capability is there.
EndUser: And when we talk about the underlying data cloud, how it can power some areas, there's areas in which it enriches really, really well. But the goal being that as we move forward and we'll see [DATE-13].
EndUser: During [PERSON-16] . we're going to be leveraging a lot of this kind of [PRODUCT-4] data plus [PRODUCT-3] moving forward.
EndUser: So we wanted to show you that Data Cloud can definitely do the zero copy use case, can tie into what we've talked about in the past, but also give you a glimpse as to where [ORG-1] is looking to get to and how we're going to be leveraging it across everything.
EndUser: So it's not a one-off application is going to get the benefit. It's really more foundational and tied to that metadata layer that we talked about for ad nauseam. That makes sense.
EndUser: So just add a, add a,
EndUser: I'm trying to decide how best to, to phrase this question. So like this draft email over here in the panel on the, on the right, that, that's a feature that's enabled by data cloud.
EndUser: Is that right?
EndUser: So this one right here, this is just a using a large language models. This is a generative example for co-pilot. We are prompt builder, which is the.
EndUser: If I wanted to not just do generative, if I wanted to enable my reps to have multiple prompts of like introduction, warm, warm email, et cetera, et cetera, that [ORG-16] is influenced by data cloud.
EndUser: So they're little, they're little, this one, the [PERSON-13] co pilot for [ORG-2] is roadmap for additional enrichment prompt builder. how you would directly have your agents kind of utilize that capability does have a [ORG-2] component.
EndUser: I can let [PERSON-5] actually see. Yeah, it's the Prompt Builder to give it like, you know, at its very simplest form,
Agent: You know, old capability mail merge, right?
Agent: Right. But it's mail merge with [ORG-13]. Right.
Agent: And the ability within that LLM to use data from both within [ORG-1], you know, like as you all said earlier, so from the [ORG-1] data model and data cloud, and that includes [ORG-2] piping through zero [ORG-17] over to Snowflake in your case.
Agent: Both co-pilot and the prompt builder, and this is a future we actually just released to then the pilot that we've added a vector database into. Data Cloud as well.
Agent: And so that enables that retrieval log minute generation and it all lives wit h them what we call the trust layer. So your data is never believing what's within your control an d sales force.
Agent: So the data doesn't leak outside, it's not used for training by any external [ORG-13] and the trigger linking into .
Agent: So it's very set of capabilities and if you're familiar with that new brag, a prototype or tree belonging to generation, it's really about Grounding the LLM into the context of your data.
Agent: So in this case, we'd say the context of your customer or your executive or your prospect.
EndUser: Okay, so I'm thinking on my feet a little bit.
EndUser: I'm just trying to, I think in terms of analogy, But maybe, can you go back one screen for me?
EndUser: And, or back to, back to that drafted email, there we go. So let's just say, we've got all this information, [ORG-18] contact, everything is in the service cloud.
EndUser: Then we have our payroll system over here that is, you know, more or less disconnect transactional system.
EndUser: Let's say something like in the future, I wanted to say something about maybe something went wrong with [PERSON-18] at [ORG-16] company. Something went wrong with their payroll.
EndUser: We could we could bring in some of that payroll that transactional data into something like a sales force. We could bring in all that Service Cloud information.
EndUser: Maybe they've been contacted in the past about some payroll issues and we could we could have this copilot say, Hey, draft me an email apologizing for the payroll that went wrong last time.
EndUser: And it's going to have the context of all of that data enabled by [ORG-2], right?
Agent: Yes. Yeah.
Agent: And you think about something like addressing the issue that you've had, the resolution steps that were taken, and maybe you want to also include a paragraph or some bullet points on the awesome things that you have done together.
Agent: Sure. OK, so [PERSON-2], here's where I'm missing on that. So.
EndUser: How did the payroll data, why is that in data cloud?
EndUser: It's accessible through data cloud. It's that shared data model between Snowflake and Salesforce. Okay, so let's say we,
EndUser: Like I'm not necessarily agreeing that zero copy should cover everything between [ORG-2] and snowflake.
Agent: Correct. That's normally not what would happen. Like you may have 19 different kind of main models within Snowflake that interests separate disconnected areas or they have light connectivity between them. It would not be a normal pattern.
EndUser: To make all of that available, not even available in the data cloud. And my example is, you know, again, thinking on my feet, an imperfect example.
EndUser: I just, I'm wondering like, what data is in bounds for this LLM?
EndUser: Like, what data is in bounds for this LLM to access, not necessarily for training purposes, but for contextual purposes?
EndUser: Like, You know, maybe in Service Cloud, you have, hey, we've contacted [PERSON-19] three times in [DATE-13] with payroll issues. And, you know, you have all that information here.
EndUser: And then over on the other side, you have some more of the transactional information that could be leveraged in some sort of a context.
Agent: I'm just I'm trying to draw I'm trying to draw like almost like the [ORG-18] in my head like how all these things go I mean you think about that your [ORG-18]. This is you know, it's a
Agent: Model, it's one. You can make it one. Right.
Agent: So in a traditional virtualizer federated data model, you know, say if you were using something like, you know, [PERSON-19] or [ORG-19] query against it, you can have the concept of a broader model.
Agent: The data could sit in 10 different places. Right. We generally make the choices about where the data sits based on a couple of principles. You know, data gravity.
Agent: So where is it mostly used performance is a key one is well, the availability or latency of data availability how quickly you can get it Like that's a difference between five training Data Cloud for the core, [ORG-1] objects .
Agent: Um But it's you have your data model that's a bunch of great bubbles linked together.
Agent: But then if you want to put a second layer in color Code where they sit and you've got some purple for the sales or blue for the [ORG-1] data. And so data is colored.
EndUser: So is this in the zero copy versus say the five-tran model?
EndUser: So I typically thought about it. getting data from [ORG-1] into Snowflake. Yes.
EndUser: But in this case, you're making the case that if we are using zero copy, then anything in my Snowflake footprint is effectively available to my [ORG-1] footprint. Good, [PERSON-29], that's up to you.
EndUser: Now, obviously [PERSON-13] understands the metadata in its own [ORG-2] data structures.
EndUser: How does [PERSON-13] come to understand the metadata around all the data?
EndUser: Okay, well, we'll be specific since we're out in the public now, right?
EndUser: So you guys know we did a deal with [DATE-13], right?
EndUser: So now we're going to have multiple payroll platforms in the <inaudible>.
EndUser: And I'm going to pull all of that data from, for a client, whether it comes from our aims from your environment or it comes from [DATE-13], it's going to be in snowflake. But how, so how does.
EndUser: I mean, your [PERSON-13] doesn't inherently know anything about, you know, workday metadata or aims for mere metadata, how that data structure or payroll data in general, how does [PERSON-13] become educated on
Agent: The non-sales force things that are in snowflake?
Agent: Yeah, so you're effectively creating that right Snowflake doesn't know anything about that data either until you specify what that data is bring it in perhaps transform it to put it into a common transactional table for payroll transactions.
Agent: And then when you share that in the data cloud, the mechanics of it are, let's just keep it super simple. You have a table in Snowflake, and you want to make that available in the data cloud.
Agent: You go into [ORG-2] and you connect over to that Snowflake table. And when you connect over that Snowflake table, you're getting all the columns and everything else.
Agent: In Data Cloud, if you want to, you can rename those columns to a more business-friendly name that the types of users that are in [ORG-1] may better understand than if you have like a highly technical, sort of common technical field names within [GPE-2]Agent: And then that, now we'll call it an object instead of a table.
EndUser: I don't want to interrupt you. Is there a, I know we have the architecture slides and the consumption slides.
EndUser: Is there a slide that would help you kind of lay it out with a visualization?
EndUser: I just didn't want to, don't want to chime in too much, but I know we have some of those architectures that may. Yeah, let me, let me share my screen real quick.
Agent: [TIME-1] here to move it into presentation mode. And let me know if you can see a super busy, Yeah, thank you. This was not meant to just jump into the blue, but to feed up into it.
Agent: But what I'll show here is, whoops, sorry, I clicked forward.
Agent: Here we're talking about data federation with [ORG-19]. Inside of this Data Cloud box, there's a lot of capabilities that [ORG-2] has and their option was just capabilities just like the Snowflake.
Agent: You could use a [ORG-29] or you can use real, their real-time streaming connector. You can build applications with their app framework. You can use their new transactional multimodal database.
Agent: Within [ORG-2], there's lots of capabilities as well, which you can use or not use depending on the use case and what works best for you.
Agent: But what we're talking about primarily is we get information and bottom left from [ORG-1] or into [ORG-2] and that is directly in the Data Cloud.
EndUser: And more than likely you can use a batch model, but more likely you're going to use a [ORG-35] type model. So the data is very quickly coming into data cloud.
EndUser: If you have zero copy from [ORG-2] into snowflake, then obviously- Is that zero copy- Is the zero copy concept not the same between [ORG-1] and Service Cloud and Data Cloud as it is between Snowflake and data cloud?
Agent: No, because the [ORG-1] data inside of [ORG-1] is sitting on top of a transactional database. So for the same reason you'd move sub no, that's not zero copy from [ORG-1] core, which is the transactional data.
Agent: So what we're setting up is that [ORG-35] to make the data persisted within data cloud, which is the top of an analytic database.
Agent: What has changed data capture?
EndUser: I'm sorry change data capture is what [ORG-35] stands. Oh, yes, I apologize. Yes. Yeah, so just streaming that just call it streaming the data.
EndUser: Okay, so what is it is what is the latency between sales force and data cloud?
EndUser: Like, is it expected?
EndUser: Is it near real time?
EndUser: Or is there something?
Agent: It is near real time, like with most streaming things. You have a common expectation, and then you also have an expectation for delays occasionally. That's just part of streaming. No, it delays [TIME-2], days.
Agent: Like what?
Agent: It can go up [TIME-3], but the expectation is like [TIME-4].
Agent: Okay, so, you know, like it's not true real-time that requires a specialized database like I like I'm used to with [PRODUCT-5], but those things are super complex.
EndUser: So the latency occurs between [ORG-1] and [LOC-2].
Agent: There is no latency between [ORG-35]. correct, it's query time or access excuse me, it's not necessarily a query, it's access time.
Agent: So when Snowflake access is data cloud, whatever's in [ORG-2] at that millisecond is what gets returned. So that also, by the way, happens to be a significant advantage versus using five-tran for the [ORG-1] data.
Agent: If you really need near real-time data, I know with five-tran you can go down and even ask them to do a [TIME-5] sync.
Agent: It doesn't matter if I have to enter reading from the Salesforce API, and five-tran can schedule a sync every [TIME-6]. It doesn't mean it's getting all of that new data [TIME-7].
Agent: It just means it's attempting to every one minute.
EndUser: So just so in the five-tram model, which we said is a known quantity, we're not leveraging the streaming services between [ORG-1] and Data Cloud. I'm sorry. So yeah, [PERSON-1], we're different mechanism.
EndUser: It's not the streaming services that you're using between sales. Sales cloud and data cloud, it's even a different mechanism to get the data into Snowflake with 5.
EndUser: We're basically that streaming from all those orgs down in the bottom left. We're basically taking advantage of the same mechanism that they would be taking advantage of to put into data cloud. We're just doing it directly into snowflake.
EndUser: So we're using the change data capture through [NORP-1] connector to [ORG-1].
Agent: But that's not change data capture. that it is a completely different technical implementation. Okay.
Agent: That is hitting the five tran, excuse me, the Salesforce API, the common platform API, the same way everything in the past is connected to get data out of [ORG-1] into some external data warehouse or excuse me, data persistence layer.
Agent: So again, this is cool. So the net on that is.
EndUser: When if we're going the five-tran route, we are not involving [ORG-2] in the service. Correct. Yeah, you're just using platform API.
EndUser: So from that context, we rule out any use Cases from Data Cloud to leverage Snowflake in the five-tran model. Because in that context, data cloud, we're not really leveraging data cloud.
Agent: Correct. If you just have five trans snowflake, there's no requirement for data cloud.
Agent: Now, on the other side, do you think about the reverse [ORG-17] side making data available back into sales force?
Agent: Not saying [GPE-1] or [ORG-6], but just in general, making that data available through the sales force metadata later, meaning it can be used anywhere, any normal object can be used within sales force. the way people normally work.
Agent: In fact, I got that right here. Sorry, that's probably way too small to see.
Agent: But we think about the normal composable data stack, right?
Agent: Or the modern data stack that five trained and dbt have talked about, which [GPE-3] over at dbt, you know, said [DATE-4], like the modern data stack, we need to put using that terminology.
Agent: He's really the one that coined it. But on the flip side, you have reverse ETL down here and under the ingestion and transport. And that's a common part of these stacks.
Agent: So obviously, if you have snowflake, your query consumers can just use [GPE-4] into snowflake, right?
Agent: Most common, you know, However old it is now, it's been around ever since I've been here. So [DATE-13] or so using [GPE-4] to access anything in the database.
Agent: Reverse ETL is used to then push things, say you've transformed that data with [ORG-20] and snowflake, and then you want to get that data back into workday, back into [ORG-1], back into other applications or reverse [ORG-17] is what you would use.
Agent: When you have [ORG-2] with zero copy, you're no longer having to push that back into an ETL. You're no longer having to create the custom code.
Agent: Or pay for a tool like these reverse ETL tools to get that transformed data back into [ORG-1]. Instead, you just have access to it, like it's a native object.
Agent: And the way we're doing that, by the way, with Snowflake, is it's not just running JDBC queries. We actually have We share the data using iceberg open source format set up as what's called a snowflake.
Agent: I think they just changed the name, but [DATE-16] they called it a Snowflake external table. And it's actually doing direct file access. It's Snowflake isn't running a query against us.
Agent: It has access to our file metadata and we do the same thing with snowflake. We're not just running. you know, JDBC query, we're actually running a native Snowflake query that has direct access to Thunderlying S3 objects.
EndUser: So you've, I guess, confirmed at a much deeper level of the things.
EndUser: So why, why don't we have, so you've confirmed for me as kind of a person looking to create value, and I can't imagine all the ways that I might create value.
EndUser: The [ORG-29] solution built on zero copy is a huge risk mitigation approach for me. in terms of what the business might dream up. If I go that route, I don't have to say no.
EndUser: I don't have to do any reverse [ORG-28]. I don't have to tackle all those things. I kind of get, the world is my oyster and I can be confident that the underlying modern data solution is there.
EndUser: Yet we're not there with zero copy. Like why, that's where I come back to.
EndUser: Why do we not have zero copy turned on between Data Cloud and snowflake?
Agent: Yeah, so I don't know why you don't. The mechanics for us helping get [ORG-2] set up, assuming that it sounds like y'all already have [ORG-2] itself turned on.
EndUser: And that's what I guess that's what I don't have an explicit answer on. We sign the PO. We've been talking a lot about different use cases. I think we've landed on exactly what you're talking through, [PERSON-5].
EndUser: That's what we want.
EndUser: And now I need to know like, [PERSON-8], is that something on your side that needs to happen?
EndUser: Is that something I need to go talk to [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-9] to get turned on?
EndUser: Like our end point, our end point, uh, consultant guy is like, he's asking the same question.
EndUser: Why don't we have [ORG-2] turned on?
EndUser: Why can't we use reverse ETL?
EndUser: Why can't we do zero copy yet?
EndUser: And that's if we can answer that question [DATE-1], then I'm going to have a lot of them have. really happy people in the room next door.
EndUser: I would venture with [PERSON-1] because we didn't know the end in mind for you guys yet. So it's like, yeah, we could set all that up. But I think [PERSON-1], you better articulate it.
EndUser: And maybe there was just lost in translation, but I don't think we fully appreciated the end use case.
Agent: For you guys and we can certainly help with the resourcing and documentation, all that to get the plumbing set up and answer questions and all that good stuff.
Agent: I don't think we had a good appreciation of, okay, it's an analytics use case or it's like one of these workflows you saw or whatever it is.
Agent: The first most critical piece and this for the first critical use case is
EndUser: Zero copy doesn't have to be the answer. But based on all the reasons we've heard, I want it to be the answer.
EndUser: But the first use Cases is really about getting out of the recipe business for [ORG-6], point blank, and building better foundational data sets to Support the use Cases we haven't delivered for [DATE-13] in sales, the growth sales summary report.
EndUser: We've still not effectively delivered that to sales management.
EndUser: So that's the first use case, and I get it, we could get there, but there are absolutely use cases, where it appears to me, and the other piece that I was actually writing up in chat to the team here is like, we need the [ORG-19] architects and the [ORG-1] platform architects to have crossover on knowledge domain between Snowflake and data cloud.
EndUser: I don't see a way around it.
EndUser: Like, fortunately or unfortunately, we've typically looked at these as different spaces, but I am seeing use Cases where if we're using zero copy, There's power in [PERSON-13] on top of [ORG-2] on top of snowflake, right?
EndUser: Like, like I can even use the Einstein one. tooling on top through [ORG-2] through snowflake. And I don't want to say I get it for free, but I kind of do.
EndUser: If we go zero copy between [ORG-2] and snowflake, I more or less have ubiquitous use of the underlying data from both tool sets, both both tool.
EndUser: Like, so one would be growing, it would be specifically trying to create predictive or actions or best Cases generative in [ORG-1]. I would probably. enable that through . Einstein on top of [ORG-2] on top of snow.
EndUser: Like the data would move this way up through to where [PERSON-13] is delivering in service clock.
EndUser: The flip side is there may be a use case for [ORG-35], which is more animal, you know, flight risk of an individual account, which is doing analysis in snowflake, but it's pulling data from data.
EndUser: So in that way, it's moving up to the this. I feel like I get the benefit of both platforms sitting on top of complete datasets.
EndUser: If we go this route yet, I've kind of been getting from [PERSON-2] that we, we just, we haven't.
Agent: I don't know. Mechanically, here's the couple of things that need to happen or could need to happen. So obviously, [ORG-1], where your [ORG-1] instance is hosted, where your Snowflake instance is hosted, it's feasible that they're on different regions.
Agent: Right now, our cross region capability requires us just to get our product managers to put on that feature flag for you because it's in pilot.
Agent: If it happens to be on the same region, then it should just be there.
Agent: That's on the what we call the data out or, you know, the zero copy from [ORG-1] into Snowflake, meaning Snowflake can access the [ORG-1] data.
Agent: The flip side of it requires a feature flag to be flipped, and that's the [ORG-40] capabilities or [ORG-1] being able to access snowflakes. So the mechanics are Need to find out the the regions that both are on.
Agent: And we should know what sales force region you're on, obviously, and you can let us know where your Snowflake is hosted.
Agent: And then we should be able to get back really quick to say these are the exact steps that you do. in Data Cloud if it's already in the same region.
Agent: This is what you're going to do in Data Cloud to create back connectivity. And then we work with RPMs to cut on the feature flag if it's necessary based on where you sit. So.
EndUser: Is there a risk of, is there a risk of a cross cloud compatibility?
EndUser: I don't know what [ORG-1] is sitting on, but I do know that Snowflake is on [LOC-3].
EndUser: So I don't know if [ORG-1] is on AWS and we're on Azure and Snowflake, is that going to cause some cross-clap?
Agent: That would take that feature flag that I'm talking about. Not just cross region, but also cross cloud. So that would require that feature flag. Okay. Yeah. So I do know that we're on [LOC-4].
Agent: My goodness, I cannot talk [TIME-8], guys. I'm sorry, [LOC-3] for our Snowflake instance. Okay.
Agent: Then what just to set an expectation, what I've seen, and I know our [ORG-2] product managers are doing a big presentation [DATE-10] internally, enabling on the lots of new things that are in our current release.
Agent: They're doing the release training internally. over [DATE-17].
Agent: It, in my experience, has taken two [DATE-13] just to get a feature flag turned around and to get people officially nominated and accepted into the pilot. That's our internal process. And then they just go click that.
Agent: So that's something that we should definitely be able to get started.
Agent: And then [PERSON-1], if you're wanting to run this, obviously we normally, would recommend in something like this not to try to go through and do a full setup. You're just sort of taking a look at it.
Agent: So let's pick some of your primary objects that will Support this first use case that you could actually carry through to do.
Agent: I'm sorry, did you say gross sales reporting?
Agent: Right. And let's get those enabled and mapped so that so that you can start querying them from Snowflake and blend it with the other data that you have there.
EndUser: Yeah. Well, We'll just have to, um, at this point, we kind of have two horses running. I guess we got the five trans horse running and now we're going to talk about. I'll call it the zero copy horse.
EndUser: Like I need to make sure the zero copy horse doesn't eliminate all the other, uh, five trans horses
EndUser: But I'm thinking and updating the same data. Well, so [PERSON-1], in the other way, they're going to be different table names.
EndUser: Yeah, we'll deselect all the objects in 5TRAN that we want 0 copy to do and we'll build the streams in 0 copy.
EndUser: So there will be a mixed use where some of our maybe our less need for real-time things. And honestly, it's also going to come down to credit consumption.
EndUser: If 0 copy is cheaper than more at 5TRAN, then we'll put a lot of our eggs in the 0 copy basket. You know, but 5Tran is still absolutely going to be
Agent: Essential for getting data from, let's say, slice to snowflake.
Agent: So [PERSON-1], well, what will be the BI or visualization layer for kind of this new, say like the gross sales report, once you kind of do the new data model, like, are you?
Agent: I think it's going to be [ORG-6] out the gate.
Agent: I mean, [PERSON-2], you want to talk about that or no?
EndUser: [PERSON-8], that's probably another conversation we need to have. We're up on our [DATE-18] invoice for [GPE-1], but I'm also hearing there's a new, this new [GPE-1] embedded architecture model.
EndUser: And I need to understand what the difference between that and [PRODUCT-4] analytics is. So [PERSON-13], [PRODUCT-4] analytics is the answer right now, but it could be [GPE-1].
Agent: Yeah, and I think so what I would venture to offer up is like two other next steps to go continue to work with [PERSON-5] and on and team on the kind of mechanics or just talking about [PERSON-2].
Agent: I think a follow up on we were going to suggest this is a follow up on the consumption. behaviors.
Agent: So like, hey, when I do zero copy, what service is being invoked and what are the <inaudible> credits and consumption patterns being consumed.
Agent: So [PERSON-5]'s got kind of an overview of like how things get charged and what activities entail what and that alone is kind of like a, you know, beefy [TIME-9] discussion.
Agent: So I think you guys will find that in helpful.
Agent: And then I think probably a follow up on kind of like the BI strategy if it's like [WORK_OF_ART-3] because there's some inherent benefits there versus [ORG-6] depending on your BI route that we could explore and talk through .
EndUser: Yeah, I think from my perspective, purely academic perspective, [GPE-1] seems to, it seems to just make more kind of academic sense.
EndUser: However, like [PERSON-1] said, there's already been a pretty big investment in [PRODUCT-4] analytics and a lot of visualizations that have already been written.
EndUser: And so how much of that is hot swappable with [ORG-2] versus the [ORG-6] data, data store asset or whatever that's called. Right. So those are some of the things that I want to talk to you.
EndUser: I mean, the value there is we've already got end users accustomed to consuming the visualizations. Yeah.
EndUser: However, if it's like a lot of heavy lifting to you, if you're basically having to redo all the visualizations, if, if it's not built on a [ORG-6] recipe, I guess we'll have to evaluate. I agree. I agree, [PERSON-1].
Agent: Okay, got some good next steps. I'm sorry, go ahead, [PERSON-5]. I was just going to say the same thing. So we asked him concrete next steps.
Agent: [PERSON-7], I guess you and I will coordinate directly with [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] and our internal team to make sure that we can get everything set up.
Agent: And, and then be able to provide some assistance to you actually getting it set up and sort of, you know, help him work with you on that limited scope.
Agent: And the last thing I'll say to [PERSON-2] is you know, when I said that you're not going to be updating the same data in snow flight between five tran and and data cloud, I meant that because they're gonna have different table names.
Agent: Right. So, you know, in the future, if you're gonna use data cloud, all your, you know, it just makes sense to have all your sales force objects accessed through data cloud.
Agent: You know, you need half of them going five-trained, half of them this way. I think that would just cause confusion if you ever had an issue.
Agent: People would have to take extra step to even understand, well, my using sales force for this table or I've trained for this sales force table.
Agent: But, you know, for forgetting this going, we'll just select those tables that you need Just makes, you know, quicker .
Agent: Pile of Implementation for you a quicker way than to get you started so that you can see how it works.
EndUser: And I know. Another Data Cloud use case, I mean, I know I'm trying to slam this in after time. So we have [ORG-1] chat that's supposed to Go Live here in [DATE-16].
EndUser: And it's my understanding, so that we'll be able to get the Einstein GPT stuff running on top of chat, but that's done through data cloud, right?
EndUser: That was not my understanding. So that would be okay. So that's it.
EndUser: In order to get case summarization or chat case summarization running through [PERSON-13], [PERSON-35], we don't. So all the [PERSON-13] stuff doesn't have to run through data cloud.
EndUser: Yeah, not all of it. So I can speak to it now. Yeah, so the Call Summarization component is basically leveraging the call transcript. So the transcript technology or the chat transcript.
EndUser: Then basically what it's doing is it's going it out to an LLM within our Trust Layer to say, hey, this is our lengthy chat transcript, summarize it.
EndUser: So you don't need the Data Cloud piece doesn't underlie that, but there are some when we talk to that larger scope from like a sentiment analysis modeling that it can.
Agent: So we can do a good kind of session.
Agent: Of like where is the Data Cloud layer for the specific [ORG-35] or [FAC-1] features And there's a lot of those you think about them as you know you've got an application capabilit y like service summarization.
Agent: That's an app . But that same data, the transcripts, that's why we have the vector database so that it can come in, provide a different level of global search capability outside of that service summarization application within [ORG-1].
Agent: That same data can be made available through the vector database and [ORG-2] in the future, and then it's available much more broadly. It will Support some other application capabilities, but you'll also be able to just.
Agent: Query that data through a search. There's a future decision on whether or not we want
EndUser: The full chat summary to be available in [LOC-2].
EndUser: Yeah, and I think that we can be real choosy, [PERSON-1], about what we do put into [LOC-2].
EndUser: And again, just, you know, what are we doing from And I'm going to use air quotes and [ORG-17] perspective and a reverse [ORG-17] perspective.
EndUser: We can be choosy about what streams We actually build into data cloud, which I think one of the other things too is [PERSON-5] You said you had some slide where on the credit consumption model And that's separate than the Service Cloud kind of [PERSON-35] model, right?
EndUser: So that's something that [PERSON-7] and I talked about [DATE-18] is Data cloud credits are separate than Service Cloud credits.
EndUser: So we need to get a good understanding on what those different cost models are and what's using credits and what am I using credits versus what is [PERSON-6] using credits for and what contracts are they on, all that good stuff.
EndUser: That's its own session, [PERSON-2]. And I'll get that. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, and just to the three on my team, or I guess more specifically, [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-2],
EndUser: I feel like we need to pull our architects into these discussions because, Let's be honest. I mean, the, the level of detail that appears to be mattering is pretty low. Like, I don't want to say it.
EndUser: Maybe it's not beyond all of you guys, but like, like, I feel like, I guess I'll say like the polls and the day bows are they're going to have to collaborate on on how, from multiple levels, like literally how we even tackle these things versus what is the cost and like we could potentially engineer something that's very cost inefficient.
Agent: Right. And I can help with that both explaining the model.
Agent: Like you can do the same thing in Snowflake, right?
Agent: I've been working at
EndUser: Working where I've worked. I've seen those costs explode too. You have to understand how it works. Your architects do absolutely so that something does not get built.
EndUser: So is there a training path?
EndUser: Is there a known training path that we could push our platform like all four of them?
EndUser: Or go together or some set go together and get a common understanding of
Agent: Kind of Snowflake Data Cloud like I don't I don't know what I'm asking for but we don't have the excuse me they may have done a really light one [DATE-19] but like super light not good for architects.
Agent: There is training available out on the [ORG-1] training side, out on [FAC-2].
EndUser: There's trail maps built there. I think there's some Data Cloud sort paths, there are trainings too. We can get you more on that, [PERSON-1]. There's the free stuff and then I think there's some more advanced stuff. Yeah.
EndUser: One more thing, [PERSON-8]. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's go ahead. Just because I'm on that training, [PERSON-9]'s already going down that route.
EndUser: So one of our architects, let me talk with him and see kind of what path he's taking because I'd love to get you guys is buying on the on, you know, that he's doing the right thing.
EndUser: And one more thing just before I, I've been talking with him on the side quite a bit, [PERSON-1], actually.
EndUser: And as you guys are looking into, just make sure our architecture can talk between Snowflake and we still haven't upgraded to [PRODUCT-6] yet. So I don't know if that makes a difference.
EndUser: I assume it will make some sort of a difference in maybe how you guys might be able to enable it or not, but just a little disclaimer there that won't be happening in a production environment until I believe it's [DATE-19].
EndUser: It's [DATE-29].
EndUser: Yeah, so [PERSON-6] kind of along that same vein, [PERSON-8], maybe a good deliverable to from me just to help me wrap my brain around this is maybe like a list of all these different components.
EndUser: What's GA, what's private preview, what's public preview. You know, even [PERSON-5], like you were talking about the cross cloud, you know, thing is kind of in this kind of preview, like.
EndUser: Just so that we all have a good understanding of like, what are we using that's like tried and true and tested and generally released to the public versus what are we using that might change and shift a little bit more over [DATE-35] as we're building things?
EndUser: That would just really help me from like a going down, like what is our... what is our path forward, you know, not to say that we won't and shouldn't use all these, but like, and then like [PERSON-6] said, where are dependencies on [PRODUCT-6] and those kinds of things, just so that we don't start architecting something and then run into something and be like, well, you know, that's a private preview and we weren't in private preview and that, you know, that sort of thing.
EndUser: Yeah, so we're, we're right there with
Agent: Snowflake, the march is for that data and [DATE-35] is the GDA. Okay. So like we're just
Agent: Yeah, I think it's like [DATE-20] to anyway, somewhere in there, our [ORG-2] does releases [DATE-29] internally a little bit different than the overall [ORG-1] platform because we have so much more that we're trying to make available here as we accelerate our open vision.
Agent: But stuff like it's the furthest along.
EndUser: Yeah, well, it's like [PERSON-7] and I were talking [DATE-4] too, like even the credit consumption model has kind of iterated over [DATE-28] as you know we're getting closer to to a [GPE-5] and so just understanding like, what could we expect to change what could we expect to change significantly maybe minor changes and what is like this is good to go out the gate.
EndUser: You can, you know, you can bank on this until the next release cycle.
Agent: Absolutely. That makes sense. So yeah, I'm a, [PERSON-7] and I have a, have a task to go get those mechanical bits understood and going. I'm available as an architect [PERSON-1] to talk with you and.
Agent: [PERSON-6] and it sounded like [PERSON-9] was the other gentleman's thing. More than happy to jump on calls with you. I can do that [DATE-19] if you want.
Agent: I am going out of country for a little bit, but I'd be available and else [TIME-10]. I'll be over in [GPE-6]. for [DATE-35] working, but really happy to sit down and go through that.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm just, this is really high level. I am trying to walk a line. Like we still have foundational things. that need to be addressed in our implementations. This is mostly between [PERSON-3] and our service and sales organization.
EndUser: Utilization, I mean, we still the finance runs still aren't clean because users, the assets to invoicing doesn't get done. So they're still like blocking and tackling, but I would like.
EndUser: This is why this use case around the GSSR is so big, because it's a pretty sophisticated use case. And we could use some of that, I'll call it a head of your technology to try.
EndUser: But that's where I want our teams to try to push some of these more progressive type solutions that are more on your cutting edge. Now we have to evaluate them to make sure they're not based on problematic foundations.
EndUser: Around process, etc. So another one that I, you know, so that's why the chat one is so interesting to me.
EndUser: But also when we do push onto Service Cloud voice, when we're running the entirety of the contact center on the sales cloud. feature, you know, and we're getting service summaries.
EndUser: Then I think, you know, getting into the, the predictive use cases, the generative use Cases around emails, chat responses, all those things. And maybe at that point, I'm talking more to you.
EndUser: Is it [PERSON-20]?
EndUser: [PERSON-7], Then that's not all data cloud, right?
EndUser: That's not necessarily data cloud, but this, I have to tell you, mind the line between [PERSON-13] and Data Cloud has gotten. a little bit murkier for me on this call. [PRODUCT-7] part of Einstein one platform.
EndUser: Then there's half the ability that may or may not require that data [PRODUCT-8].
Agent: And just like [LOC-2] itself is actually a couple of underlying data things. Like I've talked about the vector database. There's the primary analytic objects or a hot store.
Agent: Like we make that multi modal and polyglot so that you have that one interface and that underlying layer is, you know, the need some abstraction for you. Yeah. I need our people to understand the nature between.
EndUser: [PERSON-13] and [LOC-2], you know, is it like this?
EndUser: Is it like this?
EndUser: Is it like this?
EndUser: Is it, you know, a little bit better?
EndUser: And then layer Snowflake and all the other things that we got going on So just it's a good conversation to keep going but Yeah, so [PERSON-2], whatever we need to this this.
EndUser: And honestly, I mean, we had it, we didn't say this, but the second highest priority case for the Snowflake stack is tracking end to end case movement.
EndUser: We've struggled to produce that as a [ORG-6] recipe, which is literally, you know, I don't know [PERSON-2], maybe you can voice it but literally.
Agent: How a case gets initiated to how it moves its way through the organization, through a series of all the time intervals and reassignments and time intervals. Yeah, that's a really complex data transformation to get to that.
Agent: It really is. Yeah, so [ORG-5] is still working on making sure that they really deeply understand what the ask there is.
EndUser: You know, because I told [PERSON-29] [DATE-40], I felt like that was kind of the easier slam dunk use case and the more we get into it, the more it's not.
EndUser: And so that's, they're really trying to wrap their heads around the requirements there. And then there could be also some external data that fits into that one as well.
EndUser: Yeah, I think that goes back to what [PERSON-28] was saying earlier. We might, that might be a result of some of our data decisions on how we implemented some of this case stuff too.
EndUser: So we just have to get a better understanding of the full business model of how we implemented it as well. Yeah.
EndUser: All right. Thanks. Bye guys.
Agent: Thank you. We'll get back to you. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Bye.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer to this question is unclear.

What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are the open-ended questions asked by the sales rep:
- ""So maybe we can get into that because we had a couple others, one kind of like related to customer health, one related to marketing, kind of like a prospect experience and tie Workflow to that.""
- ""So maybe we start with the analytics and just the solution architecture, what we prepare there and I'm sure you'll have some more questions.""
- ""And I don't know, again, it sounded like maybe the original intent for this meeting wasn't necessarily to go deep into, you know, [ORG-13] into this use case, but kind of like [PERSON-1]. No, it actually was.""
- ""So, [PERSON-5], did we want to go ahead and get into some of the use Cases that you were going to, or the use case, we were going to around analytics that you were going to show?""
- ""And it's not really a comparing and trust necessarily. And it's five-trans-no-flight. They're really, [PERSON-2], as you mentioned earlier. You don't have to use both. It's kind of one or the other.""
- ""So let us walk through that and then we can answer some, get some more feedback from you if that's all right.""

10. The sales rep could have done a better job explaining the relationship between Salesforce, Data Cloud, and [ORG-35] features, including which data is available through which platform and the global search capability of the vector database.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""Can you describe at a very strategic level, high level, what is the intended Salesforce relationship with Snowflake? Like between Data Cloud and Snowflake, is it? Are they competitive platforms or are they symbiotic platforms?""

The customer's response indicates increased engagement as they provide a detailed answer and express their understanding of the symbiotic relationship between Salesforce and Snowflake.

2. ""So is this in the zero copy versus say the five-tran model? So I typically thought about it. Getting data from Salesforce into Snowflake. Yes. But in this case, you're making the case that if we are using zero copy, then anything in my Snowflake footprint is effectively available to my Salesforce footprint. Good, [PERSON-29], that's up to you.""

The customer's engagement is evident as they ask for clarification about the difference between the zero copy and five-tran models and show interest in understanding how data becomes available in the Snowflake footprint.

3. ""So why, why don't we have, so you've, I guess, confirmed at a much deeper level of the things. So why, why do we not have zero copy turned on between Data Cloud and snowflake?""

The customer's engagement is clear as they express their desire to understand why zero copy is not yet enabled between Data Cloud and Snowflake, indicating their interest in moving forward with this solution.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer expressed concern about the complexity of the object model in their current implementation, which they believe may have contributed to their issues with Salesforce's Lightning component.
2. They also mentioned struggling with the recipe process in Salesforce's Lightning, which they found to be untenable and not scaling well. They have had to repeatedly rely on professional services to address these issues.
3. The customer is considering using a five-trans model to keep their Salesforce data in Snowflake or using the zero-copy model, but they are unclear about the specific steps they need to take on the Salesforce side to enable these components and communicate effectively to build streams.
4. The customer is working with a consulting group, [ORG-4], to help them stand up the Snowflake ecosystem, and they are at the point where they are ready to start tackling their first use cases in the new environment. However, they are unsure whether to rely on the five-trans model or the zero-copy model for their Salesforce data in Snowflake.
5. The customer is also concerned about the cost implications of using the zero-copy model, as it may involve Data Cloud credits and the cost of moving data in the five-trans model.
6. The customer is interested in understanding the Snowflake relationship with Salesforce Data Cloud, as they are unsure whether they are competitive platforms or symbiotic platforms.
7. The customer is also interested in exploring new capabilities with Snowflake and Tableau Embedded Architecture for solving some of their problems.

If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: It is unclear if the right decision maker was on the call to move the deal forward. The sales call involved multiple participants from both the seller and customer sides, but it is not explicitly stated who the final decision maker is.

However, there were agreed-upon next steps for the technical setup and understanding the credit consumption model. [PERSON-7] and the seller's team will work on understanding the mechanical bits and getting the plumbing set up. They will also coordinate with [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] to make sure everything is set up correctly.

Additionally, [PERSON-5] will provide a briefing on consumption behaviors, and there will be a follow-up discussion on the BI strategy. [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] will also discuss the next steps regarding the BI strategy.

Furthermore, [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-2] are encouraged to involve their architects in the discussions to ensure proper understanding of the technology and its implementation. There is a plan to schedule a call with the seller's architect to help with this.

As for the decision-making process, it is not explicitly stated in the transcript, so it is unclear if the right decision maker was present.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They were interested in using the seller's product, specifically for its data cloud capabilities, and were looking to understand how to best implement it for their use cases. They also mentioned the potential of using the seller's product in conjunction with Snowflake, and were keen to understand the costs and benefits of this approach. However, they were also concerned about the complexity of the implementation and the potential for high costs. Overall, they seemed engaged and interested in moving forward with the deal, but wanted to ensure they had a clear understanding of the implementation process and costs."

EndUser: Hi.
EndUser: How are you doing?
EndUser: We had a hang on for my volume up a little.
EndUser: All right, I got a dog barking in the background. That's all right. I can't hear it actually. Zoom does a great job of buffering it out.
EndUser: Oh, good.
EndUser: Awesome.
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-1]. Good [TIME-1].
EndUser: How are you?
Agent: Good, how are you?
Agent: Good. The lunch has been flying by. I'm managing to stay warm. So that's a good thing. All is going OK. All things considered.
Agent: How are you hanging in there with this weather?
EndUser: It has been an interesting [DATE-1] myself. We had a [DATE-2] strategy session in [GPE-1] [DATE-3]. And I was supposed to be there through [DATE-4] [TIME-2]. And with the storm that blew through.
EndUser: Was not staying there. So I hop in a car and drove to [GPE-2], got here at [TIME-3] on [DATE-4]. Oh, you beat the storm. I beat the storm, but I good.
Agent: Oh, shoot. I lost you for a second there, [PERSON-1].
Agent: Or is that on my end?
EndUser: No, I think
Agent: [PERSON-1], we lost you for a second when you were saying you beat the storm.
EndUser: Now I'm back yet, so it says unstable for some reason. Yeah, so I said I just don't want too many more of [DATE-5]. These were odd ones, so.
Agent: Right, yeah, and a little rough. Hopefully warmer weather ahead for all of us. So I know we have a lot to cover [DATE-6]. I think we can go ahead and jump in here.
Agent: We do have [PERSON-2] from our [PRODUCT-1] team who will be joining shortly. There he is, perfect timing. [PERSON-1], we do have one new team.
Agent: Remember, I know you two were on at the start, so I don't know if you had a chance to do intros, [PERSON-3].
EndUser: We were just saying hi. I didn't know. OK, great.
Agent: So [PERSON-1], I'm really excited to bring [PERSON-3] into the conversation. Over the past couple of meetings, we were working with [GPE-3]. Unfortunately, [GPE-3] had to take some time away from work due to some, some personal matters.
Agent: But the good news is [PERSON-3] is fully brought up to speed. We've had great meetings with her [DATE-6].
Agent: We're not going to be asking you to repeat yourself, how did he think?
Agent: I know every time there's someone do it's like, boy, here we go. That's not the case here. I made sure that the full team. is aligned with all the meetings that we've already had with [GPE-3] .
Agent: [PERSON-3] has great experience with [ORG-1] and in the [ORG-1] ecosystem . really glad that she's here to help lead [DATE-6]'s discussion .
EndUser: And [PERSON-3], sorry, did not introduce myself earlier because I did a double take and went, have I been on a call with you or not?
EndUser: I can't recall. So I didn't, I should have. So, but sorry to not intro and say hi.
EndUser: No, no, that's totally fine. I myself as well. Um, yeah. And I mean, huge kudos to, to our team here for, um, you know, maintaining the continuity here.
EndUser: And as [PERSON-4] mentioned, I'm one of [GPE-3]'s peers on his team reporting up to the same manager there. So goal is to provide a continuity of service for you.
EndUser: When I have been in the [ORG-1] ecosystem for [DATE-7], helping customers get on to [ORG-1], expand their footprint, expand their [ORG-1] team and knowledge, and been in the Professional services industry in legal and finance and accounting for [DATE-8] that.
EndUser: I'll just jump right in here, our whole team here. As we said, one [ORG-1] team. I think you know everyone else on the call. It was just myself
EndUser: So I wanted to share our agenda with you before we jump right in. And we had planned to recap what we had heard from the previous conversations with you.
EndUser: Share our approach for the project as well as the scope. Talk about the timeline and investment. talk about what differentiates [ORG-2] from the other partners in the ecosystem, and then wrap up with next steps.
EndUser: And just before we do that, does this align with your expectations for the call?
EndUser: Is there anything else that you see that we should add to the agenda here?
EndUser: Guys, I'm gonna ask, look in one little piece of information that is new from the last poll and just check from a timing perspective of an ERP.
EndUser: Can we table that because we didn't know?
EndUser: [DATE-9] we had our strategic planning meeting with our exec team and [DATE-10], Q3 and Q4, they are going to begin working on internal scoping and scoping with a [ORG-3] partner to implement the [ORG-3] platform.
EndUser: That means our work to integrate will most likely start in Q4 from a scoping perspective and then the work to actually implement would be [DATE-11]. So that's [DATE-10].
EndUser: So when I say Q3, Q4, that's our [DATE-11]. So we're currently in [DATE-21]. So [DATE-15], more working with them. Following [DATE-19], Q4 for us would be really out as [ORG-1].
EndUser: And that's we need to integrate what transactions, what objects, etc. And then the work to integrate would be more [DATE-10], [DATE-21] timeframe and [DATE-15]. So just give you a heads up on that. Excellent.
Agent: That's great. Appreciate that, [PERSON-5].
EndUser: Awesome. All right, so just recapping what we heard based on the previous conversations. Our understanding is that ultimately [ORG-4] is looking to optimize the business processes, specifically looking at the contracting Workflow and introducing automation with generative [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: We are looking to bring in [ORG-5] services to provide best practices and recommendations. And so as you mentioned about the strategic priorities, this slide should be familiar as it's the information that you've shared with our team.
EndUser: So we just wanted to anchor on that. And for the purpose of this proposal, we'll be focusing on impacting those first two priorities on the screen.
EndUser: So number one, we understand that Fusion is looking to increase the conversion rate for new students, as well as improve the parent, which are your customers, experience through the contracting process.
EndUser: So through the conversations we uncovered that there's some challenges in the number of steps it takes for parents to resign contracts and renew.
EndUser: And we want to reduce those steps and ultimately create more efficient processes, evaluate some tools and ultimately optimize the experience for your new and existing parents slash customers.
EndUser: And then on the second priority is about the teacher's time with students. So of course, we know that the teacher's time is best spent directly one on one with the students.
EndUser: And so the goal is to maximize that time by reducing our your teachers. and min work and what you might call busy work of what they need to do between their time of educating and spending with the students.
EndUser: So we discussed looking into introducing generative [PRODUCT-1], using the trusted and secure tool Einstein [ORG-6].
EndUser: We wanna leverage out of the box functionality to start that crawl approach, to start to introduce automation and reduce some of the manual effort.
EndUser: And one question just for the team to make sure this isn't a big deal, but just trying to get very specific. The reduce admin time is not going to impact time with students.
EndUser: Time with students will not change the understanding. I just want to make sure everybody understands what we're trying to do is reduce the manual administrative process of summarizing sessions. and try to cut that down.
EndUser: So student teacher time will stay the same. It's just that follow up, work summary, close out type of processes that are very administrative is what we're trying to automate as much of that we can.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-6]. Yeah, we're on the same page with you.
Agent: Yeah, so the goal there at our understanding is all of your teachers are [TIME-4] employees, right?
Agent: So when we're reducing teacher admin time, they're not necessarily taking on another class.
Agent: I mean, maybe there's some scenarios where they are, but more likely than not, they're just you're paying them for [TIME-5], right?
Agent: So you're able to reduce your operational expenses while still serving the same number of students.
Agent: Did I encapsulate that correctly in terms of like the business impact that you're looking for?
Agent: Okay, great.
EndUser: Thanks for that clarification.
EndUser: That's a that's a great point Anything else here, have we have we recapped accordingly?
EndUser: The only other thing to mention is Number two is the project priority.
EndUser: We want to go after first just to make sure the team's aligned and in doing number two, we're looking to try to scope out number one while we execute number two.
EndUser: And that's really more for how we book financials. We're looking for a capital project to do some learning on number one.
EndUser: Yeah. Perfect. So then with that, that's great transition. We'll get into the overall approach for the project and the scope.
EndUser: So firstly, on this slide, I'm just going to give an overview of how we are planning to approach the project, make sure that aligns with what you were expecting [PERSON-1].
EndUser: And then I'm going to hand it over to [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-2] to go into a little bit more detail in terms of the two project work streams. So.
EndUser: The way based on what we heard, the way that we envisioned this, is that there'll be two concurrent work streams aligning to those two priorities that we just discussed. So one work stream is the contract Workflow optimization.
EndUser: And as you mentioned, this would be a define and design work stream where we'll bring in a team of experts and they'll spend [DATE-14] to review and assess the contracts and e-commerce workflow. and ultimately provide recommendations.
EndUser: Again, we'll get into more details on the next slide, but at the highest level, you know, they're going to be going through success metrics. They're going to be reviewing the current state architecture and processes.
EndUser: They're going to provide future state capabilities and process flows and ultimately recommendations on how you would roll this out as an Implementation project.
EndUser: Questions.
EndUser: Ok. And then part two of this happening at the same time to gain some efficiencies here would be to implement that Zoom summary automation with Einstein conversation insights and using generative [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: And we'll be leveraging that out of the box functionality for that crawl approach so that the user where we're getting started with automation and we have lots of room to scale and build it out further as you, you know, expand your use cases across the organization.
EndUser: And so this would look like, again, we'll get into some more detail on the subsequent slide, but ultimately it'll be a [DATE-18] engagement with our [PRODUCT-1] resources running through a typical project phase where they'll plan and discover they'll configure the [PERSON-8] generative [PRODUCT-1] component, and then of course testing and deploying and knowledge transfer over to the fusion team.
EndUser: So at the highest level, does that align with what you were just saying on that previous slide in terms of wanting to build out the [PRODUCT-1] while reviewing and assessing for the contract piece?
EndUser: As long as we're saying this is one project, one statement of work, and therefore invoicing will be for one project, two different deliverables.
EndUser: Yes, we can do that.
EndUser: This is the...
EndUser: I don't want anybody to take this question as an integrity question, because I want to make sure we maintain proper financial integrity, but one of the things, again, I was trying to make sure we're doing is we are... we are able to capitalize as much of the work as we can.
EndUser: And the challenge I have run into is define and design terminology in statements of work, our [ORG-7] based type of activities, not capital.
EndUser: And so how can we do this so that it's not two projects that are just being invoiced on the verse?
EndUser: Because if that's what it turns into, then we're going to have to look at them differently and say the first one's P&L impact and that's the concern I have.
EndUser: I'm trying to figure out how can we get the team that would do [ORG-8] be able to get the results of number one in their build process. is looking at it.
EndUser: And if you guys jot me tracking it kind of where I'm trying to go with this to figure out how do we do this so that we're not.
EndUser: I can't I can't go to our controller and say.
EndUser: We really have two projects capitalized everything because, again, it's going to hit P and [PERSON-9] And then that's going to be a different answer whether we can do number one.
EndUser: And what you didn't hear [PERSON-10] the rest of the team did back in [DATE-15], we did a massive layoff. We've ripped a number of employees because financially we are our challenge.
EndUser: So any additional P and L immediately gets Not even it's non optional for us as an organization.
EndUser: So the challenge is scoping And design and define is all P and L based activity That's why we're trying to figure out can we have a team that is doing the [PRODUCT-1] build also do some discovery while they're doing the build to get.
EndUser: Two answers with one capitalizable project.
EndUser: So I make that.
EndUser: I want to make sure I understand, but I think the way that we have it structured, we are assuming that we don't have dependencies in these two streams and they can run concurrently.
EndUser: And we have some efficiencies with resources, but When we get into the resource, I will show you this. There'll be the key resources that will be focused on the contract Workflow optimization.
EndUser: And then we have two resources that are focused on the [PRODUCT-1] implementation.
EndUser: Yeah, that's my struggle.
EndUser: And I don't mean to, the challenge is if we schedule the team that we have dedicated resources doing option one and different resources doing option two, then [PERCENT-1] of the financials that are in option one is going to have to be P and L for me.
EndUser: It's just a general, it's an expense. It's not capitalizable. It's not delivering an asset that I can give to my
EndUser: Controller and say this is what I had sales force build for us. This is now a decreachable asset.
EndUser: Therefore it qualifies for capital The second one is the second one is we've implemented a solution that you can now depreciate The work that they did the first one has no build work And if it's if they're not one project where we're learning number one while we're building number two I mean it's going to be expensive
EndUser: Hey, [PERSON-1], this is [PERSON-7]. Let me just throw an idea out there and you tell me if this is along the same line. Generally, the terms of a sow allow us to swap resources.
EndUser: So I'm wondering if in the sow we could specify. Well, and you'll see later on in the present in the deck that we have a technical architect and a solution architect, et cetera.
EndUser: What if we just had those specific roles with a total amount of [TIME-6] and then once the [PRODUCT-1] piece is done, swap in a different person with a different expertise to do the design and discovery?
EndUser: But on the saw, what would look like one technical architect with one solution architect?
EndUser: Let's just see where we get. I just want to make sure we can't. I'm not sure. I just wanted to escalate that as
EndUser: On paper what we're looking at. Yes, this is what we're trying to do the The struggle is if we truly separate it even in a statement of work saying it's too concurrent work streams.
EndUser: Again, what I'm telling you is our finance team is going to read this and it's going to come from. And I'm going to tell you already, they're going to say, these are two projects. Your first one is expense.
EndUser: Your second one is capital. And immediately that first one is out the door is not even an option. Yeah. And we were literally micromanaging expenses because of how under Revenue and over expense we are.
EndUser: Our Marketing department spent [MONEY-1] more than they were budgeted. And we've had about a million shortfall on Revenue that we expected. You merge those two two and you end up with [DATE-17].
EndUser: That's where we're at. So we have zero on the spend side capital. I could spend. Because it doesn't impact my EBITDA. It's depreciable. It has no direct impact on margin or my EBITDA expense.
EndUser: Every dollar impacts EBITDA and we are at a total freeze of. of any additional expense. We literally have a salary of hiring freeze right now. We have all that.
EndUser: But capital, we still have major investments we're making in business. And this is one I'm trying to do.
EndUser: So that's the, which is part of why the second one is going to be a move because it's capitalizable and the end outcome should be reducing our employee expense.
EndUser: So it's a win-win, right?
Agent: So, [PERSON-1], thank you again for clarifying this.
Agent: I know we talked about this in some past meetings, but I think what was it [PERCENT-2] clear until now was, from your perspective, essentially, there can't be any resources that are not blended.
Agent: Like it needs to be the same team on both projects because that way when the [ORG-9] is analyzed, it's interpreted. Yeah. Okay.
Agent: And there are... As you're looking to, there is like a project management resource that we have blended across these two, but then there are some distinct resources because of the subject matter of each project.
Agent: But I think that's something for our services team to see what more we can do to see what flexibility we have here. That's helpful to understand. So thank you. Yeah.
Agent: And that's why I go back to that starting with the [ORG-10] piece of
EndUser: If we can't have the same resource, do some side work to learn this as they build, and we have to have different resources because they're the right ones on your team, then we got to kind of do a pause and say, okay, what do we do?
EndUser: How do we move forward with the second?
EndUser: We can't do this because again, I don't ethically want to go back and say, well, here's what we're doing and do something different. That's the [ORG-10] point. I'm not willing to shift, but that's where we go back to.
EndUser: If it truly is different that you guys are saying, I need to hold different team over here. then we need to kind of do a hold on number one.
EndUser: Still move on too, because that's still gonna have huge benefits for us. And then figure out what the cost is two one and see. If there's any way I can get my team to even invite the bullet.
EndUser: Maybe the answer is we don't do number one right now as two separate projects.
EndUser: We say, are we going to work with you to truly do the work?
EndUser: And therefore I have design and build all in one. And that is much easier to capitalize when you do everything in one shot.
EndUser: Like there's still design elements in the Zoom summary automation, but the fact that you're doing the build and I have a product to depreciate, I have the ability to depreciate more of that project than if I say, I'm just doing the architecting now, but not not delivering anything but an architect plan, if that makes sense.
EndUser: So let's kind of see where we get to maybe, and again, maybe we have to do a pause on one and rethink that. I just don't want to hold too up.
EndUser: Again, I think that's huge value, especially when I finally ran the metrics. I don't know if you saw the truck.
Agent: The volume that we have [TIME-7]. There's lots of time that can be saved. Yeah, exactly. So.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: All right. Let's talk a little bit more in detail about some of the scope and the deliverables for the contracting piece. [PERSON-7], I'll hand the mic over to you. Sure. So I'm sure you're familiar with this process, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: Basically, the first part of [PRODUCT-2] is essentially interviews with stakeholders and within users, a technical assessment of the current org, from a data perspective, from a configuration perspective.
EndUser: Actual agents doing the contract registration, etc., but also parents themselves, actual end-users. Again, I'm sure you're familiar with that process. Then we would take [DATE-18] to essentially assimilate, assess all that information gathered, come up with a recommendation.
EndUser: And the focus for this entire exercise would essentially be three key objectives.
EndUser: First of all, how can we optimize the workflow?
EndUser: How can we optimize the existing Workflow and process using out-of-the-box tools?
Agent: Oh, there we go. Okay. Assuming I know [PERSON-3] just so you know.
EndUser: Oh, sorry about that. I'm not using out of the box tools and capabilities.
EndUser: The second would obviously ensuring that you have an underlying data architecture, which is scalable and extensible specifically to support things like e-commerce, self-registration, future [PRODUCT-1] enhancements.
EndUser: And then third, of course, would be how can we enhance and simplify the user experience and the deliverable there would be mock-ups and storyboards of how a user experience and flow could work.
EndUser: So any questions?
EndUser: I know I kind of rushed through that, but again, I think this is something from a process perspective you're pretty familiar with. The Okay.
EndUser: Lines with me, what I'd expect.
EndUser: And [PERSON-1], so from your finance team's perspective, because we're not building something tangible in technology, though we would be delivering assets, they would not see that as something that is a. OK. Now because the asset is a blueprint and
Agent: A direction, it's not a usable product that you can depreciate as an organ.
EndUser: Okay. Yeah, right. There's no decrease of [QUANTITY-1].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, my house analogy, my house analogy is anytime spent with the architect or the builder to design what you want to build
Agent: Is expense.
EndUser: Anything that they actually build on your site with shovels and pools, nails, hammers. That's appreciable. And that's when I look at development or build. Anything you guys are configuring in [ORG-1] is now a depreciable asset.
EndUser: Any planning, team meetings, design documents, even strategies. You can't live in it.
EndUser: And so it's, can you live in it or can't you live in it with the house analogy?
EndUser: And if you can live in it, you can depreciate it.
Agent: That makes sense.
EndUser: It does. Yeah. Thank you. All right. I'm going to hand it over to [PERSON-2] to speak a little bit about the project stages for the [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: All right.
Agent: Can you hear me?
Agent: Okay. All right. Yes, [PERSON-1], by the way, I love that analogy.
Agent: Like, you know, it always, I mean, most of the times it works, right?
Agent: Anytime, you know, I used to do, when I used to manage the manufacturing, I went back and it asked like, you know, I'll always go back and look at the activities that you do in the four building universes.
Agent: But thanks for reminding me that, you know, I went back, you know. years I've been using the home building analogy and development. Yes, this is a [DATE-25] AI Implementation stream.
Agent: These are high level activities started at this point. Obviously when we put the survey we will see detailed activities and we will be doing what type of language.
Agent: So [DATE-28] it's all going to be around, we will do a little bit of discovery and planning, look at your current state summary process, all summary process.
Agent: And then, you know, we want to kind of talk about the future state in terms of use case requirements and [ORG-11] on those .
Agent: And also, I think the important thing, other thing is the align on the success criteria, like what would you see as a final success criteria with the future state?
Agent: And then there's going to be some design work and setup work that's going to happen with [PERSON-8], [ORG-6], and connecting to your voice provider. In this case, it says Zoom. I mean, it's a different one.
Agent: We can do that configuration. So [DATE-18], it's mostly about building that foundational stuff.
Agent: You know?
Agent: And then I think week three and four is all about in out of box, configuring the call summaries, you know, the edit capabilities for the summary, email capabilities, you know, setting up the right roles, you know, depending on the design.
Agent: And the key is spending good time on validation, right, because I mean, this, the testing in [PERSON-8], [ORG-6] or any [PRODUCT-1] is slightly different from typical.
Agent: I mean, hold in this testing that we have seen, you know, you really had to run through several scenarios to make sure that you are, you know, getting the right quality there.
Agent: And [DATE-26] would be mostly around making sure that we wrap up all the documentation, you know, deploying to production and transitioning to your team.
Agent: Again, this is a pretty high level [DATE-25] in a typical use case deployment we do with the most of the Einstein GPTs.
EndUser: I think there's one piece that I'd like to add in, and it's kind of another piece of plan and discover. And that would be what do we need to change on the fusion side so that these things connect.
EndUser: And here's, I was thinking about this a little bit more. When you look at the volume that we have, and again, I'm gonna throw myself in examples, I'm a very visual person.
EndUser: So let's say on this call [PERSON-4] is the teacher. [PERSON-7], [PERSON-11], [PERSON-3], and [PERSON-2], you are different students in our system. And [PERSON-4] is going to have four sessions throughout [DATE-18], one each with you in your sessions.
EndUser: How do we make sure the system knows [TIME-8] session was with [PERSON-7]. The [TIME-9] session was with [PERSON-11], the [TIME-10] session was with [PERSON-3], and the [TIME-11] session was with [PERSON-2].
EndUser: In [ORG-1], it's integrating Zoom. Because if we don't know that and the system doesn't have that, it's not going to be able to do the [PRODUCT-1] summary for the right student.
EndUser: And that's where I'm trying to understand what will we maybe need to change that you guys have assumptions or expectations of. the system and the data so that it does line up.
EndUser: If that makes sense, because right now, what most of them are doing is they use their personal room. And at [TIME-8], [PERSON-7] jumps in at [TIME-9], [PERSON-11] jumps in at [TIME-10], et cetera.
EndUser: So it's the same. And so I wanna make sure I understand what we either need to change or, make sure you guys have a solid understanding of how we do it [DATE-6].
EndUser: So the assumptions that you would make to make this a [DATE-26] project align and run into these kind of projects where people we get a lot of surprises where oh, I didn't realize this is what you were doing.
EndUser: This is now [DATE-26] longer or my gosh, we need you guys to build something for this to work.
EndUser: How do we make sure we have the right assumptions before we kick this off?
Agent: Yeah, no, it's a great point.
Agent: I mean, typically we do document assumptions, but I think I remember from [DATE-3] in [PERSON-1], you mentioned about it's [DATE-28], somebody that you would like to send it to, you know, that the parents.
Agent: The summary, right. That summary, the summary goes parent.
EndUser: Right. So, so in that example, I'm going to change it around a little bit and say, okay, now you're the student, but [PERSON-4]'s a teacher, [PERSON-7]'s a teacher, actually the teacher and [PERSON-3]'s a teacher.
EndUser: And there's four different Zoom sessions throughout [DATE-18] with four different teachers for you, creation of the student.
EndUser: How does the system be able to link those together so that when they do the summary of all four two the parent, it's pulling the right ones in. For that.
Agent: Yeah. For that. Right. That, that again, I'm trying to make sure you got enough information upfront.
EndUser: If it is a [DATE-26] project, this is awesome. My gut tells me we're going to run into a major roadblock that none of us are looking at.
EndUser: I think it's how do we link the teacher student zoom sales force session records together so that they have the right alignment.
Agent: It's a great point. I think I'll end up in a make sure that we check this with our technical experts. to make sure that it doesn't in the power phase surprise in the horizon.
Agent: But I'm sure like that probably some cap will result there that we can do right here.
Agent: So, so before I move to the next one, I think there is a one slide in, I think you probably saw that start before we just want to take [TIME-11] to show you the next slide is nothing much you know I need to explain it's mostly self-explanatory now.
EndUser: This one [PERSON-2] or do you want to go to the bottom?
Agent: Can you see it?
Agent: I'm sorry that I was having an audio issue.
Agent: There was there a question here or were we just kind of highlighting a visualization of what this looks like for [PERSON-1]?
Agent: Yeah, just a visual agent. But again, this probably wouldn't look exactly like our future state because we just talked about having multiple sessions.
Agent: How do we connect them together?
Agent: This is just some basic out-of-box, you know, call somebody feature-scarted.
Agent: So if you don't have any other questions, we can probably move on to the next slide.
EndUser: Alright, so then getting into the timeline and investment summary. So. I think [PERSON-1], this will give you a good visual of what we were anticipating for the timeline and the resources.
EndUser: And let's have a think here about, you know, how we can get creative and how we can, you know, align with your needs, as well as ensure that we have the right resources with the right expertise to to execute on these two streams.
EndUser: So initially what we what we had envisioned was was the two streams as we had mentioned [PERSON-7] walked through [DATE-38] for that define and design phase . And we would have a halftime project manager.
EndUser: They would be sitting over both project streams. So that's where we're gaining the efficiency and same with the engagement manager.
EndUser: We have an engagement manager to align with executives and oversee the project as well as provide an escalation point and they just provide [TIME-21] per week on the project. And again, they would be overseeing both streams.
EndUser: So we're gaining some efficiencies there by just having. the resources for the one stream. Then we have the solution architect, technical architect and experience designer that would be specifically focused on driving the contract process flows project.
EndUser: And they would be [PERCENT-2] dedicated to that project work stream working together. through those phases that we just walk through to deliver the assets at the end of the project.
EndUser: And then concurrently we would bring in a solution architect and a technical architect from our [PRODUCT-1] practice to execute on building the [PRODUCT-1] project.
EndUser: So any feedback here, I guess based on what you shared before, where we're having the two different specialties in these roles running across the project, you were finance team is going to see this as as two separate types of expenses, or sorry, an expense and and something we can capitalize on.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm going to need to see how we actually have it written up and how. The statement of work would actually read to see if that's going to be the case. Part, let me just give you a quick.
EndUser: I don't like jumping the solutions right away, but one of the things I was considering and trying to figure out is there something we add to the top first project that actually builds a deliverable.
EndUser: Maybe it's not huge, but maybe it's okay.
EndUser: And I know this may not sound huge to you guys, but I don't think it's going to be that huge, but maybe we implement the... fast-track sign-up option where student comes in and we have a [ORG-10] immediately signed up, don't need to talk to a parent, maybe we actually turn it into the build of that solution so that there's a deliverable so that I then can say there's two parts that I'm capitalizing.
EndUser: One is streamlining the tutoring and mentoring process and two is building an [PRODUCT-1] solution. So I actually have a deliverable or an asset on both.
EndUser: Maybe it's not the full solution on the first one, but it's something that's being delivered so that's a depreciable asset. That makes sense.
EndUser: Yeah, it definitely makes sense. I think that'll definitely have an impact on the product timeline and resources. So we'll probably look to need to add some time.
EndUser: And I think we would also want to spend some time with you to determine what, you know, work with you to determine what that deliverable should be.
EndUser: But [PERSON-7], unless you're having an objection here on the spot, I think that could be definitely a creative solution that we could spend some time working on.
EndUser: Yeah, I guess just to clarify, [PERSON-1], are you talking about some sort of self-enrollment option, like you described earlier?
EndUser: Yeah, go back to a couple of the beginning slides. We had it listed there. Can't remember where it is. But if you can go back a couple of slides.
EndUser: I think what is on here?
EndUser: Right, okay, so, yeah, so look at option one, review and assess the current state contracting journeys, the course for credit whole time and tutoring.
EndUser: If you remember on one of our discovery calls, one of the things I mentioned is we have a much more integrated and hands-on process for a full time enrollment because we need a transcript, we need to understand their academic history.
EndUser: But of course for credit or a tutoring student. If you're a foodering student, we can fast track our enrollment process or our onboarding process, but we don't. We have one process for every single student.
EndUser: It doesn't matter if you're using, you want.
EndUser: [TIME-15] of time and tutoring and mentoring, you go through the same process as somebody that wants, well, of course, is [DATE-45] and they want to be with us for [DATE-31] [DATE-33], we have the same onboarding customer process and maybe we can build something for those for that tutoring or course for credit to streamline their enrollment and reduce customer journey, so to speak, simplify the customer journey.
EndUser: And maybe that's the outcome of this. Therefore, I have a deliverable and the full-blown contracting rebuild really is for full-time students.
EndUser: And so maybe we have a short-term deliverable that we can then
EndUser: Use again, I'm just thinking out loud as something that maybe
EndUser: Maybe gets a set up. Just make sure we're following you when you say, streamline the process for course for credit and tutoring and mentoring.
Agent: So parents are literally clicking through on your website,
Agent: An advisor because they're not doing the full-time student. with my thinking to an advisor.
EndUser: But here's what I mean, because our customers call us, the majority of the time are fill out a web form. We can do something online great, but I still think we want to route them through to talk to.
EndUser: But the problem I have is you're now on the phone with me. I'm one of our call center agents, or I'm an enrollment specialist.
EndUser: And I got 21 stage enrollment process that I'm forced to go through because we built it for every single student type.
EndUser: Maybe at the beginning of this, we say, if student type is tutoring, go to this screen flow and fill out these 10 fields that are critical to get to the point where I now can contract with you on the phone.
EndUser: I can't even build, if you're a brand new customer, I can't even generate a contract with you on the phone.
EndUser: You gotta go through [DATE-28] worth of all these crazy processes that we have in our system that we forced you into. to enroll.
EndUser: And that's part of what I'm talking about is blasting apart our contracting and enrollment process because we put so many roadblocks in place, we make it hard for you to become our customer.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Right. So I'm saying skip all those for tutoring and mentoring or maybe just maybe just a [ORG-11] student and say, here's the new [ORG-10] process. That's what we build for this and our agents still execute it.
EndUser: But they now have three steps to go through to contract versus, again, I'm exaggerating 11. I don't know what it really is, but it's not fun. It's not even sure. Right. Maybe that's what's delivered.
Agent: From this and to your point. Okay. So not necessarily a new tech now, not necessarily a new technology for online e-commerce.
Agent: That's still future state, but it may be the first phase so that there's a deliverable is improving the workflows for the phone based sign up so we can get that down to a faster.
EndUser: What's the simplest way to add into this project so that phase one has a deliverable for us to be able to capitalize?
EndUser: Okay, so we still go to optimize. Right.
EndUser: Optimize would be we did the scope work. We want to do a full blown project which would really optimize the entire process. What is a simplified simple deliverable so we have something, not just an assessment.
EndUser: I'm going to think throughout a little bit more too again. What I'm doing is dangerous because I'm brainstorming as well. But I'm just talking about that. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
EndUser: Well, yeah, but I think it will help get something over the finish line to be able to do.
EndUser: Yeah, well, let us brainstorm and take it back. But I think just to recap, we'd. There's still the desire to go through [DATE-45] optimization. And in addition, we're adding a quick win.
EndUser: That's one portion of a output from this that our team could deliver. You know, we talk it on [DATE-46] at the end of the the engagement. So that you have something.
EndUser: One would argue that you need to do the full assessment of the current state to be able to make sure that you're delivering a quick win at the end. And that's why I'm going to go back and go.
EndUser: Having something like that at the end would give me the ability to justify. This is a project that would qualify for capital expense because we have to do all this work to make sure.
EndUser: This first phase single delivery is done properly. And then it also would give us the ability to say here would be phase two and three that we can then do at a future state.
EndUser: Pending financial group, right?
EndUser: So.
EndUser: You got subtract, we have to go.
EndUser: Okay. [PERSON-7], I don't want to put you on this spot before you've had a chance to think through this and digest it.
EndUser: But if you do have any questions or thoughts right now that you want to share, we can use a little bit of this time.
EndUser: Otherwise, I'll continue on with what we had based on what we knew before this conversation.
EndUser: No, I guess the only question I have, [PERSON-1], is that do you have anything that would describe?
EndUser: Or maybe even a Recording somewhere of what's what the current process is for course for credit enrollment.
EndUser: I would have to have somebody record it. We don't have anything. I can just there's nothing I can say. Hey, here's what we do. Yeah, we have it in. I'm sure we have it in our employee onboard training.
EndUser: That's not publicly accessible. So I can't extract an asset. It says online.
EndUser: So.
EndUser: Inform to some degree kind of the magnitude of effort or the complexity, right?
EndUser: You know, and give me a sense of
EndUser: In terms of getting that piece of information.
EndUser: Is that something that we could set up a follow on call with our team and yourself and and one of your business users that can provide some answers to that process for us.
EndUser: If that's what's going to be needed to start this, I'll need somebody to record that and send your Recording so you can see it so you can see the process. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: If someone's able to send a recording, that'd be great, [PERSON-1]. Or I also want to be cognizant of the amount of time that you're dedicating to us.
EndUser: We greatly appreciate it, but we know you have a lot going on. So you don't necessarily need to be on that call.
EndUser: If it makes more sense, if you can let us know who should be on it and we can let the most [PERSON-1] asked us to spend time with you, that sort of thing.
Agent: We can take that approach if you and your business stakeholders are open to it just so that we can ask live questions.
Agent: But again, we're not consuming your time and then we can circle back with you once we have more of a point of view on what the effort would be.
EndUser: And again, you know me, I'm not quite. I'll speak out loud. My only fear of that at this point.
EndUser: Is any end user I give you is going to be somebody that sits with a parent and immediately they're going to go, oh, we're doing this, we're doing this, we're doing this.
EndUser: And all of a sudden my entire organization is going to know, we don't even know what the cost or investment or anything is.
EndUser: So I just, I don't have a user base that really would be mature enough to know we're in discovery here. I just want you to share information with them.
EndUser: They're going to take it and run and I guarantee you I'm going to now be trying to And I'd prefer to get one of my team to actually just sit down and record our enrollment process so that you can see the process and get it.
EndUser: Anytime I involve the business, we got burned by that. times. We're doing discovery. We're evaluating something. Next thing, you know, everybody saying, Hey, we're changing this. We're adjusting this. This is something we're evaluating.
EndUser: I don't even know what this is going to cost.
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: And we'll get to that in the next slide here. So again, based on the information that we had before this conversation, this is our resource timeline and overall cost.
EndUser: So as I mentioned, we have some efficiencies with the EM and the project manager being one, instead of two PMs, two engagement managers, we have one over the two streams. They're accounted for in this number.
EndUser: So it It doesn't really parse out separately. We'd have to add that in if they were separate projects. But as a bundled project, this is the cost that we're looking at, $[MONEY-2] case.
EndUser: So yeah, I just wanted to gauge your reaction here.
EndUser: Yeah. So, yeah, we're like for discovery, we're psychotically off. Here's why I say that. We spent [MONEY-3] with you guys for [DATE-45] for all of our users, all of our licensing.
EndUser: We're talking [DATE-45] of that just to do a [DATE-28] discovery to figure out. Contract design and workflow. That's that's like half point development team's [DATE-31] budget.
EndUser: We're nowhere even close. I'm thinking this is [MONEY-4] for all this stuff, not 310.
Agent: I think the large investment.
EndUser: Yeah, I probably can't even do the [PRODUCT-1] stuff for 210,000 if it's new development work. If it supposedly was just feature Implementation and configuration. Yeah, we're nowhere close.
Agent: Yeah, I realized it's a large investment. We didn't prior to [DATE-6]'s meeting. We didn't really have any guidance in terms of where the budget was. So I appreciate that this is a large investment. I do think that.
Agent: That upside, I know you realize this as well [PERSON-1], but the upside to improving this process, if we can improve the conversion rate on your website for mentoring and for course for credit, and if we can improve your overall retention, even just a few percentage points, I mean, it's [MONEY-5].
Agent: So I do think it's certainly worth the investments and literally for the [PRODUCT-1], but it is substantial investments. And here's the other.
EndUser: Here's the other thing, and this is not a defensive comment, but I want you to understand we were building this and doing this work anyway. So we're still going to get that benefit and value.
EndUser: The push we had was we thought it would be wise to engage you guys to make sure that what we're building it in, features, et cetera, are the right ones to move forward.
EndUser: So, and the AI one, I still want to evaluate that because we've not done anything and we'd rather have you guys help.
EndUser: That's the only one looking at this that I would go probably has a little bit of value to still look at. But the top one, my team is going to do it anyway.
EndUser: We just wanted to engage you guys to help look at that. So, if the discovery is still just the discovery is [MONEY-6]. Again, I can't justify spending that much.
EndUser: That's that literally is half my entire development team's [DATE-31] salary. So we spent about 413,000 a year on salaries for development. You can't justify [DATE-46] the salary of hitting them just to do discovery.
EndUser: We're not that type of customer.
EndUser: I appreciate the feedback there.
EndUser: The other question I think I need to understand is what's the usage costs?
EndUser: Because this is just on the [PRODUCT-1] piece, this is the build.
EndUser: What would be the usage cost?
Agent: Right. We can move on to that. I do have an estimate here based on what you just shared [TIME-19]. So first, just kind of setting how we got to the estimates.
Agent: You shared it's about 1080 teachers who are doing the virtual sessions. And then the other piece of it is the [ORG-6] credits, which is based on basically the amount of transcripts that are analyzed by the LOM.
Agent: So based on the estimates that you had shared, it's roughly 1080 teachers and 6.5 million credits per year. Before we go to the next slide, I would say that as I was crunching these numbers, [PERSON-1], I was thinking.
Agent: Probably, although ultimately it makes sense to roll this out to all the teachers, probably it's going to make sense to take a phased approach to, you know, which of those [DATE-41] teachers are teaching the most virtual sessions.
Agent: I think the math is. you know, roughly 10 to 10 hours a month of virtual sessions.
Agent: So is that pretty uniform or do we have teachers who are doing a lot more virtual sessions than that and others who are kind of outliers who are not really doing much virtually and maybe they're not going to get as much of an impact and we don't include them in the initial rollout.
Agent: Just something to think about. I don't know if you have any reactions that before we get into the licensing structure.
EndUser: I've got your own mute.
EndUser: I'm sorry. I was looking at my spreadsheet. The spreadsheet that was in that attachment, the top 476 users are doing at least 28 sessions. Actually, 468 teachers are doing at least 28 sessions a quarter or more.
EndUser: The other 1184 or so are 26 or less sessions per quarter.
EndUser: So when you look at volume, that's a lot of session is [TIME-21], right?
EndUser: So 28 sessions a quarter. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Go ahead Scott. Oh, great. It's, it's, um, each session is [TIME-15].
Agent: Yeah. So 31 sessions a quarter that's still not.
Agent: I mean, it's more than the other teachers, right?
Agent: But 47 sessions at [DATE-34] is still let's just say it's [TIME-14] over a quarter. So that's like [TIME-18] a month or like maybe [TIME-15] a week.
Agent: So maybe we look at the top 445, maybe it's even a smaller sample size than that. I mean, we could certainly work through different scenarios depending on what you're comfortable with.
Agent: But those teachers would need to have a full [PRODUCT-3] license as opposed to a restricted license, which that's really going to be the majority of the investment [PERSON-1]. I know you know what a full license cost.
Agent: So this next slide. Um, you know. conceptually, you know your current pricing is. That's what's outlined here.
Agent: I think there's a big range in terms of how many teachers we would actually consider in scope in light of how this licensing works. So I'd watch your feedback.
Agent: I know I just got these numbers [DATE-6], so we have that how to just talk on it.
Agent: But what number of teachers would actually be appropriate for that initial phase?
Agent: And of course, based on that number, we can work on discounting from a licensing perspective.
Agent: The one other thing I'd add here, [PERSON-1], is I know there's other discussions outside of this that we're having, like the HR piece, which also has licensing implications.
Agent: So I think there's going to be multiple reasons in the future where it makes sense to have the full salesforce licenses, as opposed to the restricted one.
Agent: But I know that's kind of a bigger topic, even beyond what we're talking about [DATE-6]. So that's kind of the licensing model.
EndUser: Yeah, we have an incredibly discounted
EndUser: Model and this goes back to, we,
EndUser: If you want to run numbers to understand what it would cost us to convert to [DATE-44] versus non, but you need to, obviously, you'd need to quote throw some heavy discounting in that for us to even consider it.
EndUser: This goes back to the conversations that [PERSON-10] and I had way back before we put the teacher portal in place. around discussions around protecting what we're doing and this was exactly why.
EndUser: We didn't want to embed [ORG-1] as the foundation across the organization if it meant when we want to add something small like this or simple like this, all of a sudden we had a [MONEY-7] impact and obviously that's what this would be.
EndUser: So there's There's no scalability to us if that's what's going to happen.
EndUser: So I think I need to understand, let's just say we didn't have a restricted license so that we aren't, aren't contained from being able to roll out features.
EndUser: And again, a teacher using [ORG-1] still, even with this, is using 1 102th of what our other users are. And if we're not going to have a restricted model.
EndUser: To me, the approach should be we're going to add $[MONEY-8] to the restricted model so that you can take advantage of this feature, not that you have to go to the full license.
EndUser: If that's what we have to do, any expansion of [ORG-1] for our teachers are probably out of the scope of conversation.
Agent: So, certainly, yep, appreciate the feedback there. I'm here to be creative, [PERSON-1]. how the approach is taken in general when you have a restricted license and you need more functionality.
Agent: But I understand diffusion has a really unique scenario in terms of the number of teachers on the platform, the reality not all of them are even full-time, kind of their nature in terms of their relationship with fusion, and their limited usage.
Agent: So I think once we get feedback on how many teachers you'd want in the scope of this, and if the [LOC-1] is something that is something that could fit with [PRODUCT-4], then we can certainly, like, that's something I'll work on internally to fight that battle to say can they keep a restricted license.
Agent: But we just changed the restricted language to allow more functions. I mean, that's, it's pretty unusual, but I see a business case for that based on work, you should is at.
Agent: So if we are able to get approval for that, then, of course, then that increase per year is going to be much lower than this. But I would need to understand how many folks we'd want to include.
Agent: I think the other pieces like, is this HR process moving in?
Agent: Because of course that would be all of your teachers ultimately would be
Agent: So the more detail I can share internally in terms of the revised use case, the better I can push for getting you a special custom setup like you have had so far.
EndUser: Yeah. If the… If the onboarding discussion that you're having with [PERSON-11] again is going to create the same thing that you need to have a full User license that probably can get tabled as well again.
EndUser: We're We're we'd rather just implement a new HR solution at that point as it would cost less If we did that right so I mean We've not done an HR answer and that was going to be a your investment um, so we table that You That's where again we go to.
EndUser: We've got to be realistic of what feature benefit is. And that's where again we're going to get into.
EndUser: So I think what we need to understand is back to, you know what our license count is, oh, and this is the other thing, sorry, the [ORG-1] HR thing threw me on a tangent. Back to the teacher count.
EndUser: I can't do only certain teachers because then what we're saying is, Well, this teacher is going to get an automated summary. This teacher isn't. You guys need to figure out who it is.
EndUser: And I can't have two different processes in the system if we're trying to build an automation. That's not, that's where, again, I was like, this is either all or none. I can't say some teachers are.
EndUser: Because what if somebody decides that they're now subbing more?
EndUser: Now we got to say, oh, we got to change your license so that you can get this, but others don't. That's, it's not going to work. It either we're building a solution for organization or we aren't.
EndUser: That's, that's, that's where we can't go down this path of only a handful. Okay.
EndUser: Otherwise, we're saying that cost doesn't make sense, right?
EndUser: So.
Agent: Right, OK, so what we have to work on, I know we're short on time here, but what we have to figure out from a licensing perspective is how do we build.
Agent: The business case to retain a different type of restricted licenses, opposed to moving to a full license. So. We'll work through that from a licensing perspective.
Agent: I definitely don't think [PERSON-1] at this point that we should just write this off. It's something that we can't pursue. I think that with the right justification. I mean, there's a case here to upgrade to a different restriction.
Agent: Right, as opposed to the full license type because the business case for the initiatives that you're doing in sales force just doesn't align to a full license for this value of users. So.
Agent: What, what are your thoughts on how we proceed from here given?
Agent: I just, I mean, just the elephant in the room is, is the budget feedback that you shared [DATE-6] versus the creative ideas we were talking about like adding a deliverable into that, that optimization initiative.
EndUser: But of course, that went further increased the investments.
EndUser: So it's better to just focus on AI or what should we do?
EndUser: Right now, yeah. Because that's second. And in, in again, I understand, but. Toss or we outsource a lot to other [ORG-1] development organizations.
EndUser: And we don't just so you guys are aware, I think, for [DATE-41]. We spent with custom development with [ORG-1] development with NURO flash as a vendor.
EndUser: We've probably spent [MONEY-9] a capital for [DATE-46]. So that's why I go back to when I looked at the cost, we're burning the whole [DATE-56]'s budget for our whole organization.
EndUser: And we're getting this much development out of it. It's just, I think we're out of, I think you guys are out of our league. to be honest from Professional services for the rates just for a [DATE-28] discovery.
EndUser: We won't be able two for develop. We don't have that type of capital.
EndUser: So while we have capital budget, we're close to what this would turn into if we say build it because my gut tells me is it's probably with those rates just in the beginning, the build of the first one, you'd probably come back with a [MONEY-10] bid.
EndUser: And, and because, I mean, typically your design is a quarter of the time, [DATE-47] your, your development. So I can't even imagine we could even afford having you guys build the solution for us.
EndUser: We just don't have that money.
EndUser: Yeah, and I appreciate your candor, [PERSON-1]. Um, I mean, we want to do what makes sense.
EndUser: Another thing to think about, and I know we're out of time here, we can focus on the [PRODUCT-1] approach for now, is we often do partner with partners.
EndUser: So, if it's having [ORG-1] design and put together the best practices and architecture to ensure that we're doing it right, and then we hand that over to you and we work with a you know, we help you with finding a partner to actually do the implementation, but you're making that investment up front to ensure that, you know, you're setting a strong foundation and getting off on the right foot.
EndUser: So that's a consideration.
EndUser: But I do hear you on the budget and I appreciate your transparency so that we're all just on the same page, right?
EndUser: Yeah, we got to get to it. If it's a win-win, we move forward. If it's not, we don't. So no harm, no foul. But again, we're I'm just gone. I had sticker shock.
EndUser: And if that's close and not just the sticker shock, but if we really needed to even with the [PRODUCT-1] move into a full license. This isn't financially viable for us.
EndUser: We're not going to even get the cost benefit of doing it if that's what it's going to take.
EndUser: Because again, a lot of teachers, but you're talking [TIME-17] of time for session at the most, it takes a long time to get to that type of expense reduction.
EndUser: So again, I question whether we get the value if we have to do the full license.
Agent: Yeah, [PERSON-1], I appreciate that.
Agent: I was starting to just roughly crunch numbers from a business case perspective, like when I got your email [TIME-19] and I was thinking like, how do we make this work for fusion right because you need to get much more value out of the project, then you're paying and licensing without a doubt.
Agent: I don't want to sell you anything. You're not getting value out of.
Agent: Viable and of interest as well. If it is, then timing is similar just in terms of the process to get approval for a special custom language contract again. It would make sense to include that.
Agent: So we're not repeating this process more than necessary. But I think we have a path here. If you're saying, you know, the call summaries, then let's just for argument's sake, say, HR onboarding.
Agent: If those are the only two things you're adding into kind of the restricted use case, how do we get to a price point that is well below the additional value in terms of labor savings that you're going to experience with these two initiatives, even when we factor in implementation?
Agent: That's what's on my mind right now.
Agent: I'd like to actually, like, if you're open to it, I'd like to crunch numbers just theoretically, like a framework of how our business value team thinks of this and share it with you.
Agent: If you're open to it or we can just have a quick maybe working session chat one on one in [DATE-47] or two, just like if we're thinking about this the right way.
Agent: And I want it to be something that you believe in so that we can advocate for that in terms of the potential revised proposal.
EndUser: Open to discussions.
EndUser: Just again, we want to make sure we're looking at what are we able to do, what are we going to be locked into, and is any change going to drive us to a full user because again it blows the whole financial model up.
Agent: Yeah, I mean the goal would be to do this exercise to get through an approval process for a different restricted user license that is much closer in cost to your current one than a full license.
Agent: I mean, it's going to have to be restricted because there's just no way we'd be able to discount a full license to the level that I think that you're looking for and that's where we'll have to work through that together.
Agent: But I think that we could have [DATE-61] still.
EndUser: So the model behind and started delays, but the one thing that what the [PRODUCT-1] project gets us is an expense reduction. That is the goal behind it. Nothing other than it. We're not getting more value to our customers.
EndUser: They're already getting an summary [DATE-6]. I agree.
Agent: And
EndUser: If the cost is higher than the expense reduction, it just doesn't make sense. Even if it's the same, it doesn't make sense to do.
EndUser: It's got to be that the expense reduction is much higher than the cost to implement, which is why we go through the effort to do it.
Agent: If there's huge customer value, then you have a whole new set of value to talk about. I agree. That's not what this is, though.
Agent: And on the first project, there's a lot of customer value, right, on the contract optimization. But on the second one, it's all about labor cost reduction.
Agent: I was looking on [ORG-21] and it looks like right at school teachers typically make around 47k a year.
Agent: Is that accurate or should we do the same with the other different figure when we're?
Agent: It's pretty dang well folks because I have in a spreadsheet I was using [QUANTITY-2] an hour which is about 47. That's exactly what I want to average.
EndUser: Yeah. That's what I want to average. Okay.
Agent: Okay. Let me just put together. high level perspective on this. And then we have the HR conversation with [PERSON-11], which she rescheduled for [DATE-61]. And then we can reconnect after that.
Agent: I think what came to light [DATE-6], once we got the licensed and usage feedback from you, [PERSON-1], is that we're not going to be able to do that.
Agent: It seems like we really need to figure out the licensing piece of this before we have more conversations from a scoping perspective.
Agent: And but certainly we want to pick those up and adjust the [PRODUCT-1] proposal as appropriate if we have a case that works here. That sounds good to you, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: Yeah. I think so. I think the second thing I'd like to ask you as an alternative is if I have external data. and I build an interface to chat [ORG-6] through this, that a user would not function.
EndUser: What does that look like?
EndUser: And perfect example, do we have the ability to pull, or I should say a different way?
EndUser: Why does my [ORG-1] user has to be a full licensed user if they're not using [ORG-1] at all for the integration?
EndUser: They're still using Zoom, our teachers don't change anything. We're just getting an AI summary for each individual student.
EndUser: Why can't I build that externally that it doesn't require a user to be a full [ORG-1] user?
EndUser: Point point name. Just make sure you're pointing inside. Maybe it doesn't use your default [ORG-15] that requires you to be a full [ORG-1] user.
EndUser: Is there a different way to use [PRODUCT-1] on a per teacher?
EndUser: Because they're not using [ORG-1] [DATE-6]. They're using Zoom [DATE-6].
EndUser: Is there a way that [ORG-1] can tie into or look into Zoom differently that it's not on a per user basis to generate an [PRODUCT-1] summary, therefore not forcing us to have a full user?
Agent: The way the call summaries work is it is within the [ORG-1] interface. It does require the user to have the [ORG-1] license. So the best path will be for me to make a case to get.
Agent: Special license type approved that would work for your business case. But I appreciate the creativity. And if there's a different way to do it, that we uncover, file, and the into will explore all options for you,
Agent: [PERSON-1]. OK, I know we're over time here. Next steps are kind of pause on the services discussion
Agent: For the non-AI part, [PERSON-1], I will take your feedback back to the team just in terms of the overall contract optimization and see if we have any other recommendations on how we could approach this without using services.
Agent: I mean, I think that's where we're at, right?
Agent: And then we can find some time to talk about how we would approach the adjusted licenses and figure things out from there.
Agent: Anything I'm missing in terms of next step [PERSON-1] or anything else you'd suggest?
EndUser: The only thing I had was to have my team record the enrollment process for you guys. Yeah, that would be excellent. We'd really appreciate it if you're able to do that.
EndUser: And, you know, you're not going to be good for you guys to have. So, especially future conversations.
Agent: You get a baseline of what we're doing. Exactly. That would be great. Okay. We will talk again soon. Thank you again [PERSON-1] for your time [DATE-6] and appreciate all the candid feedback.
Agent: Really, really helpful and I'm sure we'll find a way to make this work for you. So the feedback even when it's. Very direct and clear is very appreciated.
Agent: That's the best way I prefer if you get into feedback that way so we know where we stand and we know where we need to go. But I just want you to know walk away from the speeding that.
EndUser: Yes, and don't take it as rejection. Just take it as well. We had totally different perspectives and understanding where we're going to land and we just can't afford that.
EndUser: So how do we move forward?
EndUser: We'll figure it out. Yeah, [PERCENT-2] agree. All right. Thanks, [PERSON-21]. Thanks, [PERSON-1].",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. Financial Concerns: The customer expressed significant concerns about the financial implications of the proposed solution. They mentioned that their finance team would view the two work streams as two separate projects, with one being an expense and the other being capitalizable. They also mentioned that they are currently facing financial challenges and are trying to minimize expenses.

2. Resource Allocation: The customer was concerned about the allocation of resources for the two work streams. They wanted to ensure that the same team worked on both projects to maintain continuity and avoid dependencies. However, they also mentioned that they might not have the necessary resources to dedicate to the project.

3. Licensing Costs: The customer expressed concerns about the licensing costs for the proposed solution. They mentioned that they have a heavily discounted model and would need significant discounting to consider moving to a full license. They also mentioned that they often partner with other organizations for development work.

4. Lack of Value: The customer mentioned that they needed to ensure that the expense reduction from the proposed solution was much higher than the cost to implement. They were not interested in implementing the solution if it did not provide significant value.

5. Integration Concerns: The customer was concerned about the integration of the proposed solution with their existing systems. They wanted to understand how they could link the teacher, student, and Zoom sales force session records together to ensure proper alignment.

The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's financial constraints and budget. The customer mentioned several times that they are under a salary freeze and have a tight budget, but the sales rep continued to discuss solutions and pricing without fully addressing these concerns.
2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current enrollment and contracting processes to better understand their pain points and needs. While the customer did provide some information, the sales rep could have delved deeper to uncover more specific areas where the seller's product could provide value.
3. The sales rep could have spent more time explaining the benefits and ROI of the seller's product, particularly in terms of cost savings and efficiency. The customer expressed concern about the cost of the solution, and the sales rep could have provided more concrete examples of how the product would pay for itself over time.
4. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's use of Zoom and how they currently generate summaries for sessions. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's needs and suggest potential solutions using the seller's product.
5. The sales rep could have followed up on the customer's request for a recording of the enrollment process to better understand their current workflow and identify areas where the seller's product could provide value. This would have also shown the customer that the sales rep is committed to understanding their needs and providing a customized solution.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was cautious and uncertain. They expressed concerns about the cost and financial implications of the proposed solution, particularly the need for full user licenses for their teachers. They also mentioned budget constraints and the need to justify any additional expenses. However, they were open to further discussions and exploring alternative solutions, such as building an interface to integrate with the seller's product externally. Overall, the customer seemed willing to continue the conversation but was not yet fully committed to the deal due to financial concerns.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of their company or product in the following opportunities:

1. When the customer expressed concerns about the cost of the project, the sales rep could have emphasized the potential return on investment (ROI) and long-term benefits of implementing their solution.
2. The sales rep could have provided more concrete examples or case studies of how their product has helped similar organizations optimize their business processes and increase efficiency.
3. The sales rep could have addressed the customer's concerns about the complexity of the project by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable phases and emphasizing the expertise and support that their company would provide throughout the implementation process.
4. The sales rep could have provided more clarity on the licensing and pricing structure, including any potential discounts or incentives for long-term commitments.
5. The sales rep could have done a better job of understanding the customer's unique needs and challenges, and tailoring the value proposition to address those specific pain points.
6. The sales rep could have emphasized the competitive advantage that the customer would gain by implementing their solution, such as improved customer experience, streamlined workflows, and increased productivity.

Overall, the sales rep could have done a better job of articulating the value proposition by focusing on the specific benefits that the customer would gain from implementing their solution, and addressing any concerns or objections that the customer may have had.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""How did he think?"" The sales rep asked this question after mentioning that the previous point of contact had to take some time off for personal matters. The customer engaged in the conversation by confirming that the new team member was fully brought up to speed and had great experience in the ORG-1 ecosystem.

2. ""Does this align with your expectations for the call?"" The sales rep asked this question before diving into the agenda for the call. The customer was engaged in the conversation by asking if there was anything else that should be added to the agenda.

3. ""How can we optimize the existing Workflow and process using out-of-the-box tools?"" The sales rep asked this question while discussing the approach for the project and the scope. The customer was engaged in the conversation by providing details about the current state architecture and processes, as well as success metrics.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. Financial Concerns: The customer expressed concerns about the cost of the project and the potential impact on their P&L and capital budgets. They mentioned that they had recently undergone layoffs and were carefully managing expenses due to financial challenges. They were looking for ways to capitalize as much of the work as possible.

2. Resource Allocation: The customer was concerned about the allocation of resources for the two concurrent work streams. They wanted to ensure that the same team worked on both projects to maintain continuity and avoid dependencies. However, they also wanted to avoid having different resources working on each stream to prevent financial implications.

3. Licensing and Usage Costs: The customer had concerns about the licensing structure and usage costs for the product. They were looking for a more cost-effective solution, considering their unique scenario of having a large number of teachers with limited usage. They wanted to retain a different type of restricted license instead of moving to a full license.

4. Integration with Existing Systems: The customer wanted to understand how the product would integrate with their existing systems, specifically Zoom, to ensure a seamless experience for teachers and students. They were looking for ways to build the solution externally without requiring a full [ORG-1] user license for each teacher.

5. Timeline and Implementation: The customer was concerned about the timeline for implementation and the potential impact on their organization. They wanted to ensure that the project was completed within a reasonable timeframe and that the benefits outweighed the costs."
video_19750_167_6qr3y000000sbq1AAA,"Agent: Would reflect essentially a potential new employer, right, that we might be building a connection with, working through, and ultimately progressing them through different milestones all the way down to maybe more of a structured approach and tracking things like opportunities.
Agent: And how are we actually signing these delivery services and how are we tracking that in a streamlined process as well?
Agent: So I'll go through some of that process. I'll actually.
Agent: Walk through what it might look like from a career counselor perspective as well A little bit just in terms of how we can look at job postings, how we can collaborate o n that and actually move candidates potentially through different steps as well from tha t perspective And in that process, we'll go through different types of reports and dashboards and thing s that you would have available for you as well Does that sound good in terms of a flow ?
Agent: Perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.
Agent: Let I think I'll jump me know.
Agent: Through this. You'll probably understand as well. There's just the flexibility from the UI standpoint and how this is our customer. This is our demo org, but very quickly, [PERSON-1] was able to customize this to meet your processes.
Agent: And I think an interesting division, maybe to piggyback on this with would be SHN, [ORG-1]. Because they have a lot of the very specific [ORG-2] processes, very different from what you guys do.
Agent: But really shows the extensio n and some of the collaboration that you can do so .
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. And so I will reiterate many times throughout this presentation and this demo that everything that we're seeing is configurable. So whatever you're seeing on the screen is just meant to spark some ideas.
Agent: And ultimately that's what I would like to accomplish for [DATE-1] is to spark some discussion, spark some, generate some ideas in terms of what is possible and how you could potentially frame your processes and your KPIs and your business through something like this.
Agent: And I'd love for this to be a collaborative session So please feel free to stop me if you have any question s or if you've got any feedback along the way .
Agent: Sound good?
Agent: Ok, perfect. And if I'm looking slightly up, that's just because I have another monitor, and that's where the demo is.
Agent: So all right, so what I wanted to do is get started from the perspective of a labor market coordinator. What we're looking at here is essentially our homepage. The [ORG-3] is web browser based.
Agent: It's mobile friendly, so you can actually access this through any type of device, whether you're looking at it from your desktop, your laptop, if you're on the go, on your phone, on a mobile .
Agent: I've had whatever it might be. Everything is screen sensitive, so everything will resize automatically and mobile friendly. This is what our command center would essentially look like.
Agent: And this is what I'd like to term as, you know, it's your single source where when you start your day, you are really going to start to get a feel for how you might you want to prioritize your time as a labor market coordinator.
Agent: What are some of the things that you need to focus in on?
Agent: What are some of those flags or reminders that you need to zero in on?
Agent: And so right from the get go, what we're seeing is a sample of what a dashboard can look like.
Agent: Now, I know this might look a little bit overwhelming in terms of, you know, all of the information that we're showing here, but this is, again, just an example of what we can showcase So if we think about how a labor market coordinator might structure some of their leads and their opportunities into things like a [FAC-1] or forecast, this starts to bring some of that visibility top of mind when they start their day And you'll notice things like their sound high-level KPIs that are front and [PERSON-2] So if I am a labor market coordinato r, I can see if I do have a quota or if I ha ve certain KPIs that I need to mee t, I can fly those right along the to p. I can look at any of the opportunities that I have on the go and actually structure them into a [FAC-1] or a forecas t. So I can determine what is close to closin g, what is just pretty much high level that I'm [PERSON-3] initiating with my new employer s. Are there certain things that I'm committing up to management that I need to be focused in on?
Agent: And all of these areas are filterable. So it's all dynamic. If I wanted to focus, for example, on a specific category, I can click on it. Everything will dynamically filter to that particular category.
Agent: So I'm seeing the data that is most in line with what I'm focused in on. We also have this notion of [PERSON-4], which is our [PRODUCT-1] capabilities.
Agent: This is something you may or may not choose to Go Live with on [DATE-2], but it is something that especially now with everyone talking about [PERSON-5] and chat [ORG-4] and all of those things, it is top of mind for a lot of our customers in terms of how might we start to dabble or feed in something like AI.
Agent: And so with [ORG-3].
Agent: You have the ability to use not only generative [PRODUCT-1], but also just predictive AI And what that means is you can leverage any historical data that you might hav e either based on activity trends, like how many times you've interacted with a particular employe r before something actually, you know, starts to stick or you start to get some activities with them You might look at conversion trends, how long it takes from a lead to convert to an opportunity But all of those things will essentially feed into a model that helps our Einstein capabilities help to essentially predict things like what is t he likelihood of an opportunity to actually close?
Agent: Or of all of my Pipeline or forecast, what is t he predicted outcome that [PRODUCT-1] might actually forecast from that perspective?
Agent: And it'll look at th at historical data and you'll also be able to provide some feedback in terms of how it's modeling it so that essentially it becom es a meaningful tool to help you focus in on certain thin gs.
Agent: For example, if I have a half a mill opportun ity with only an [PERCENT-1] likely hit to clo se, this might be an area that I wanna focus in on.
Agent: So it also showcases a list of accounts and opportunities right here down below of all of the things that we're reflecting at the top, which essentially just gives me a work list.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So if I wanted to drill it and click into any of these opportunities, or even use this as sort of a call list, I can do that as well.
Agent: I can showcase contact information, account names and things like that. And I can just essentially work through that list and go directly to that record. Again, this is just a flavor of a dashboard that we could potentially leverage.
Agent: If you wanted to start out with something much more simplified, for example, what types of activities your teams are working on, what KPIs from that perspective in terms of the number of meetings or calls or emails that are sent out, the events that you're attending or things that you're contributing to, we can absolutely configure these dashboards to reflect that as well.
Agent: I'll pause there.
Agent: Any thoughts or questions in terms of the dashboard view here?
EndUser: No, I really like that it's able to loop in those KPIs and have it at a quick glance. So I think that that's a really neat and interesting feature for it.
Agent: Perfect. Awesome. I will focus your attention a little bit over to the right now. And so the right is essentially a section that calls to attention. Some of our top reminders and tasks and things of that nature.
Agent: So we have what's called our launch pad here.
Agent: So if I wanted to go right into my leads or right into my opportunities, I can click into these sections and it'll take me to my list and I can go ahead and start drilling into them.
Agent: But I also have a snapshot of, you know, things that I have on.
Agent: On the go for [DATE-3] So if I'm a labor market coordinato r and I'm going through a list of to-do items I can easily get that snapshot of what's on my to-do list who am I supposed to be reaching out to Are there certain just tasks that I need to get underway And on top of that, I also have a view of any appointment s that I have And an important piece that I wanted to know here because I know it was sort of front and [PERSON-6] r when we did our discovery was all of thi s seamlessly integrated with - with your internet and your Outlook capabilitie s. So whether you're using Outlook or Gmai l, I think you folks are using [ORG-5], correc t?
Agent: Right, so if you're using [PERSON-7], all of this is seamlessly integrate d. So you're not having to [PERSON-8] where you're putting your calendar [ORG-6] or your appointment s, whether it's in [ORG-3] or an [ORG-7] All of that will connect back and fort h. So if you're using [ORG-5] as your prime sour ce for managing tha t, you're gonna see it right in [GPE-1] e. If you make your updates on [PERSON-9] For example, you had this lunch meeting with [ORG-8] en, and you want to put in some not es.
Agent: That's something you're going to have it ready and available for you within [ORG-3] to update and just edit those not es. So all of that is very seamle ss.
Agent: And I thought I would include an items to approve as well, because I know we talked about e-signatures, I know we talked about some of the contracting or services that might require approval.
Agent: From an internal perspective, if you ever do need to go through different layers of approval, if you're perhaps proposing a service that requires internal review, you also have the ability within [ORG-3] to, no worries, [PERSON-10], to streamline that process.
Agent: So you can actually set.
Agent: A Workflow that automatically sends something off to whoever you deem is appropriate to approv e and you can go through multiple levels of approval and whether you are the final approver or whethe r you're waiting for an approval to take place, you have that visibility right here on your home pag e so that again it's front and center, top of mind when you're coming back to it and starting your day .
Agent: One thing I just wanted to mention as well in terms of your tasks and your events and, you know, any types of activities within [ORG-3] is we have the ability to create automated reminders.
Agent: So things like this reminder of an event prospect follow up. We have if you're holding a webinar, if you are, you know, doing a campaign, for example, we have the ability to automatically set reminders for you.
Agent: So you're not having to manually go in and peruse your list of, you know, 23 or so task items. We can bring that front and center with you.
Agent: We can create pop-ups, you can create notifications that go either to your phone or to your email, wherever you really prefer. So you can, you know, have those those top- reminders and priorities top of mind for you .
Agent: And the last area I'll focus in on in here is again, you have the ability to right from your homepage, be able to view any of your top leads.
Agent: So really just getting that quick snapshot to start your day as well as any campaigns that might be on the go.
Agent: So if you are working, for example, with a Marketing team, if you're going through different campaigns, whether they be, you know, LinkedIn campaigns or, you know, nurture campaigns, you'll actually have the ability to view any of those details here.
Agent: You can see who's been included. within those campaigns and if you need to do any follow-up as well .
Agent: Any thoughts or questions around the homepage?
Agent: Once again, this is completely configurable and customizable where you can include one dashboard or 13, right?
Agent: You can start, I think, like from a crawl walk one perspective. You probably want to get them up and running and comfortable with the one or two that are top of mind.
Agent: And then when those are... you know, if they get acquainted to those, then you can add some more.
Agent: And you can adjust, right, based on profiles, permissions as well, based on what they need to see based on a third different teenager or level within the organization too, right?
Agent: So it's permission based. Yeah.
Agent: That's a great point to [PERSON-9] is that, you know, whether if I'm a labor market coordinator versus, let's say, a career counselor, I probably want to see different things on the.
Agent: Page so you can definitely configure this so that different user types o r different roles within the organization have the ability to just see exactl y what they're interested in versus having the same static one for every for ever y role .
Agent: And you may have answered this before.
Speaker 4: It might be coming up.
Speaker 4: Does this align with [ORG-9]?
Speaker 4: So can calls go through and track through that way?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. And that's actually a great point. What [PERSON-9] had mentioned earlier on in terms of our app exchange.
Agent: So in our app store, we have both pre and paid apps, but [ORG-9] is actually one of those vendors that's very well known on our on our app exchange.
Agent: And so we do have connectors that will bring that phone system right into salesforce as well. So that can be seamless.
Speaker 4: Great. Thank you.
Agent: No problem. All right, so I'm just going to jump into my leads.
Agent: And so from the home page, let's say, for example, our labor market coordinator now wants to take a look at some of the leads that they have on the go.
Agent: And the leads, again, would reflect any type of an account or an employer, for example, who they are just building or initiating a relationship with. and building a connection.
Agent: So from this perspective, we have the ability to view leads from different viewpoints. So I can actually create different types of lists. I can create prioritize lists based on just my own top leads.
Agent: I can view based on, let's say, for example, if they're more specific,
Agent: Event leads for instance, if I had a webinar or there was a particular event that we were hosting in person and we were capturing leads on the spot in terms of registrations, I can actually have that filter right through and create a list that's specifically zero in on those attendees and follow up that way as well.
Agent: So these lists are all configurable you have the ability to actually on a user by user basis create your own, and this just again.
Agent: Again, when you kind of look through this, it essentially is a call list, right And if you've got that Integration with RingCentral, you have the ability then t o literally call down all of these phone lines will be active and open and yo u can just call down, create your notes, and then move on to the next one .
Agent: All right. I'm going to drill into one of my leads here, more in [ORG-10]. And she's just in a new context that I'm working with.
Agent: And right from the get-go, you have a few different areas on the page that I'll go through in a bit more depth. So essentially, first and foremost, on the top, you've got your primary contact information.
Agent: But you also have just a little bit of the introduction of a workflow. And this essentially is a streamlined process.
Agent: That helps me to identify what are some of those different milestones or steps that I might be working through or stages that I might be working through to help qualify i f this new contact is someone that I'm going to continue to work with, someone I'm potentiall y just going to nurture and keep in a lead status, or if we have a really great, meaningfu l conversation, perhaps I can convert them and there is an actual opportunity with deliver y services that we can start to drill into .
Agent: And so I can move through different milestones and I can create best practices in terms of, you know, what it means to go from a working lead to a qualified lead to a converted lead.
Agent: I can actually standardize that process across all of our different users. So we're all speaking the same language. And then from a details perspective, this is [PERCENT-2] configurable.
Agent: So whatever type of information you currently want to track with your new leads, your new employers, you have the ability to create whatever field.
Agent: Whatever sections on this page that you deem relevant I have a few examples here just in terms of what segmen t or what industry does this employer actually categoriz e within what is their title or what's their role I can attract their address Cadences I'll actually get to in a little bit of detai l in a moment, but it's just a really great [PERSON-13] y to help streamline again a working process And in terms of lead scores So I thought I would showcase two different option s. You'll see a Lead Score her e. And this is where it's a little bit more [PERSON-9] If you just wanted to dabble into creating your own scori ng methodology, where perhaps you mig ht have different attributes or metrics th at have different weights, and you want to use th at in order to score what these leads actually a re and how they rate, you have the ability to do [PERSON-9] And that is absolutely something [PERSON-9] you can implement and you can create on your o wn.
Agent: Whereas we also have our, again, our AI capabilit ies where we would look at any type of historical informat ion within your database, within your lea ds, in your lead [ORG-9] on.
Agent: And we will look at attribu tes that would be top predictors in terms of, you kn ow, a likelihood for this particular emplo yer to convert into an opportuni ty. So you've got variation and [PERCENT-3].
Agent: In terms of how you might want to go about t hat. from an engagement perspective.
Agent: This, we'll talk about cadences again in a second, but ultimately, if you kind of hover over all of these, you get a quick little snapshot of how many calls or how many emails were sent.
Agent: How many replies so you can actually get down to, you know, if an email was open, if there was a link that was clicked on within it, you have visibility into actually seeing what that might look like in terms of engagement.
Agent: And again, if they are part of a particular campaign, you can view that as well.
Agent: Just brings good context into knowing if they've been reached out to in a different way, if they've attended any of your events or viewed any of your other Marketing material.
Agent: And from an activity perspective, all of the activities that we do throughout time are all centralized here as well.
Agent: So whether I'm putting in calls or emails, any type of touch points, appointments, or I've got them scheduled, that is all centralized here.
Agent: Anyone who would have access to this record would also see that centralized 280 degree view of the activities. And straight from here, I have the ability to send in.
Agent: Email, I can send it directly from here, I can send it through my outlook.
Agent: Again, it'll b e seamlessly connected, so regardless of where you're sending it, it's going to show up in both Same thing with your appointments and things of that nature .
Agent: I will pause here any thoughts, comments or questions around this.
EndUser: With the email activity, is that to viewable to everybody, including the Content of the emails or. Yeah.
Agent: So you have the ability to pretty much configure who might have access to what, right?
Agent: So if you would want anyone who has access to [PERSON-13] or this lead record to actually see the full details of those emails as well as the [PRODUCT-2] of those emails, we can configure it that way.
Agent: Or you might want to say, you know, at certain emails are private and you don't want to share them in here. So you have the flexibility of specifying.
EndUser: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Agent: Yeah. Oh worries.
Agent: And actually just jumping into the email for a second. I wanted to show you what it would look like on the flip side.
Agent: So if you were in your outlook, for example, what does it look like for incoming emails or outgoing emails and what are some of the capabilities that we offer there?
Agent: So as an example, I just have a sample Outlook account here, and I've got my email set up. I have an email from [PERSON-13] that's thanking me for her follow-up on her call.
Agent: She was looking to connect over lunch [DATE-4]. So as you can see, this is something on the right-hand side, I actually have a [ORG-3] panel.
Agent: And this is an example of how can actually look in your Outlook instance. So we're bringing [ORG-3]. information directly into your workflow. You don't have to toggle into multiple systems.
Agent: So if yo u are in Outlook, you can actually view [ORG-3] information directly from there.
Agent: So for example , by knowing that it's the same email address and I've got certain attributes that match record s within [ORG-3], I can log this email, which I have already logged it to the [PERSON-13] account .
Agent: I can also dril l into [PERSON-13]. So again, directly from Outlook, I can see all of the informati on about [PERSON-13]'s contact.
Agent: I can view any of the activities that we've related to her as [PERSON-13] It's the same view that we had within [ORG-3].
Agent: We're now just bringing it right in the conte xt of your workflo w. From here, I also have the ability to bring [ORG-3] capabilities right into my replies and my outgoing mail as well.
Agent: So for example, if I wanted to say, Hi [PERSON-13], please see below for some availability as an example. You'll notice again, I've got a [ORG-3] panel right on the right hand side.
Agent: I have the ability to either manually log. So again, this is just a configuration that you can set up.
Agent: I can manually log emails That way if you want certain emails to be private and not logged in [ORG-3], you can choose that You can have it automatically log as well.
Agent: So you have the ability to decide whether you [PERSON-22] t to log those emails. You can actually leverage any type of email template that you have . created within [ORG-3] as well.
Agent: But we have this really neat tool in terms of availability where we can actually dynamically show some available times from our calendar.
Agent: And I think this is a real-time saver because how often are we kind of going back and forth within emails, trying to figure out a time that's available?
Agent: Oh, no, sorry, that time is now booked up by the time they've replied. This actually gives us the ability to
Agent: I can go in and say, okay, I've got 229 [TIME-1] or I've got 1324 You know, I can pick a few time slots that are open I can add them to my email .
Agent: And if at any point before, you know, [PERSON-13] responds to me and she decides to click into one of these, if at any point, one of these time thoughts becomes booked up in my calendar, it no longer becomes available to them.
Agent: Right, so you're only showing in real-time what is available to that end user to that recipient. And that way you can eliminate a lot of that back and forth in your emails.
Agent: To multiple, if you have like five different folks that need to attend that meeting, right, it will be dynamic to all of those different calendars as well.
Agent: Exactly. And so, yeah, so you have the ability to track that availability, make what's available the most current.
Agent: You can, in terms of email tracking, when I kind of showcase, you know, has that email been open, do they click on any links?
Agent: That's also kind of where this is pulling from, so you have the ability to set that.
Agent: So if they do require, if they open this, you can see how many times you can leverage texture, because you can send later and schedule it out. All of these capabilities, essentially.
Agent: Are embedded right into your outlook, so you have the ability to kind of leverag e them at your disposal from Outlook as well . All right.
Agent: So that is in terms of a lead, kind of what I wanted to talk about, all the different kind of areas that you have the ability to leverage, that you have the ability to track, all of this is centralized in a single spot.
Agent: The idea with the leads is ultimately once you get to a point of working with this contact enough and you feel like there is an opportunity potentially to sign some sort of delivery services with them, you can actually go ahead and convert.
Agent: That lead.
Agent: And by converting that lead, essentially what you're doing is taking all of the informatio n that we've tracked here, all of the details, all of the activities, and we're taking that an d carrying it over into an account record and potentially an opportunity.
Agent: So all of that is don e seamlessly for you through the system. You don't have to reenter or manually enter any of tha t information again, and there's no duplicate of data .
Agent: Okay, before we get into the account, I want to come back to Cadence's because that was something that I mentioned earlier. Now Cadence's is a tool and a capability within [ORG-3] whereby you can actually set a defined process.
Agent: So as an example, I have two here. One is my top leads and from a webinar follow-up that we might have had. These are essentially, this is the configurable way.
Agent: Again, you don't need to have any sort of programming, knowledge or developer knowledge to do this.
Agent: This is essentially, you know, a business user can go in and say, what are the things from a top leads perspective that I want to structure from a process?
Agent: How do I want my team to follow through with qualifying that particular top lead?
Agent: And you can.
Agent: And set all of these different sort of milestones and step s within that process So you can say, okay, well, the first step I want to d o is send a welcome email And you can create templates right within here You can actually specify exactly what you [PERSON-22] t some of those emails to say, create a starting poin t for your team to leverage and utilize .
Agent: And ultimately,
Agent: As leads are added to a particular cadence, they will go through all of these different steps in a structured and automated way.
Agent: So, number one is I can take the first step in my cadence and I can send out that email. And if the email is clicked on, then we'll move into this branch of the process.
Agent: And it'll prompt me to make a call out to that particular lead. If...
Agent: If the call was positive and I reached the contact or the lead, it will actually promp t me again to send a follow up email And all of that will happen right in the context of my Workflow So as a labor market coordinator, all of that will happen through my screen I can get a working list of my contacts and different cadences on the left-hand side I can go through a call list and it will prompt me with those pop-ups to say, okay The next step here is to send an emai l. Okay, the next step here is to do a ca ll and enter your notes i n. So it really becomes an automated proce ss where all you're really doing is just following the promp ts and the guides on the screen that are laid out for [PERSON-22]: Just sorry, [PERSON-1], just to build on tha t, are you guys using a [ORG-13] tool toda y?
Agent: Anything like a more kettow or something there to communicate with your customers?
Agent: No. No.
Agent: Okay, so think of this maybe more as like that phase two, right?
Agent: Once you want to automate some of those communications from a digital Marketing standpoint, right?
Agent: The lead nurturing inbounding if you attend a trade show, for example, right?
Agent: And you just want to take that database and that list, right?
Agent: Coming out of the trade show and have the nurture, right?
Agent: To really minimize the touch and the activities to keep your coordinators focused where there's high value, high touch potential, right?
Agent: Where the leads are hot, and then let the system nurture these, right And then when their score builds up and when they've engaged with your brand enough .
Agent: Then it can be translated and transferred over to a coordinator, right?
Agent: So kind of that Lead Scoring where that comes into place.
Agent: But it's a really great like collaboration in between Marketing and sales really once you get there and once you guys scale and QHR within low blas does a really good job at doing this thermorphte IT brand.
Agent: They've really had that great Yeah, great synergies in terms of building up their lead funnel and getting to that point .
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: So just so we can how we're trying to be, [PERSON-13], can also grow across the time, right?
Agent: Guess right?
Agent: In terms of how this
Agent: Once again, go back to crawl walk run, right?
Agent: Start with the CRM opportunity, lead tracking, collaboration day one. But I also want to understand that you're looking to invest in something that can grow with you across the time as well.
Agent: Yeah. So just to kind of show you what is possible down the road, if you chose to use the capability like that, All right, so let's come back to our labor market coordinator. We've gone through this lead record.
Agent: We've put in our activities. We think that she's really engaged. And [PERSON-13] is now talking to us about some of the services that we offer. What we can do is actually convert that lead.
Agent: And once we do, like I mentioned, an account will be created and potentially some opportunities that reflect the services that we were discussing.
Agent: And so, Again, all of the information that we're seeing from the account record is all transferre d over and carried over from the leads So you're not having to manually enter all of this Again, you're not having to duplicate that information in multiple places That's all seamlessly happening for you behind the scenes And we also have the ability then to add a few more pieces of information So from an account perspective, there might be some other things that we want to be abl e to track So for instance, there could be multiple.. contacts at this particular account that we uncover over time.
Agent: [PERSON-13] was our primary contact from a hiring manager perspective, but perhaps different folks on the team, different folks within [PERSON-23] might be talking to the same account, but different contacts.
Agent: So we have the ability to really centralize all of those her e. I'll go through opportunities in a second, but ultimately these could reflect any of the types of services that you offer, right?
Agent: It could be from a hiring perspective, job posting, it could be grants, whatever it is from a service perspective that reflect potential revenue.
Agent: We can even centralize this is where under a given account we can specify what are some of the job postings and some of the opening headcounts and hiring prospects that we're looking at for that particular account.
Agent: And this again, I'll go into this a little bit later on, but this is where the career counselors can actually start to see as well.
Agent: What are some of the job openings or positions that are available?
Agent: We can drill into any of these and get more details there.
Agent: From a service perspective, if for whatever reason, there are some issues or feedback that we're getting from our customers, we have a centralized place where we can track that as well.
Agent: So again, this could be something that's down the road.
Agent: But from a longevity perspective, in terms of knowing your customer 280, if you're working with employers and you're kind of focusing on their long-term relationship, there are things that you might want to track over time if they've expressed.
Agent: Any type of concern or any type of feedback that you want to be able to come back to you and kind of refer back to in the future .
Agent: And then we also have the ability to pull in billing information.
Agent: Now, none of that is in here, but again, I just wanted to show some of the different things that we could potentially track, some of the different categories. This could be integrated with your back end systems.
Agent: This could be something that you choose to track just within [ORG-3] or it can be something that you choose to own all together. Again, everything that we're showing here, the tabs, all of the different sections are configurable.
Agent: You'll notice the activities on the side. So again, I've got all of that centralized information here from an account perspective as well. I have any of my AI capabilities predictive or whatnot here.
Agent: My feed is something that I thought I might just leave in here. It is something that is [ORG-3]'s collaborative tool. It's one of [ORG-3]'s collaborative tools that are natively just comes out of the box.
Agent: Ultimately what this is .
Agent: Think about it like a team, right?
Agent: If you were wanting to collaborate with other folks on your team and let's say for example, this is an interesting account and you wanted to get others eyes on it. You can at mention different folks on the team.
Agent: You can at mention your management. You can post a message in here and this just becomes a running feed of those types of side conversations that you might want to put in here as well.
Agent: And we do have other collaborative tools, very much like teams where we can create. workflows and do much more sort of powerful things in there.
Agent: But this is just one of those options i f you wanted to kind of dab your, to get your feet wet a little bit in that .
Agent: Yeah, and I think more so in terms of like be extended collaboration, right, where you don't necessarily want everybody to be collaborating within the scenario, but you want folks to be notified, right?
Agent: So just thought I mentioned type of feed where you can either get an email, you know, stream or just like the awareness around it, right, can be interesting.
Agent: Think of it a little bit like as a [ORG-9] feed, right, where you can get all your views and, you know, through just log in and everything that you've been at mentioned on or the activities.
Agent: You cannot log into the platform or you can get a notification email or whatsoever, right Yeah .
Agent: Think about this.
Agent: I think what comes to mind for me when we talked about it in our discovery is if a new job posting is created, right?
Agent: And you want the rest of the folks on your team to be aware of that or just to get eyes on it. You can at mention the rest of your team.
Agent: You can at mention specific people or groups of people as well. And those folks will get notified either via email or through their application as well. All right.
Agent: So in terms of [DATE-5] in the life, we have our labor market coordinator who's converted that lead. We now have an account. We also have a list of opportunities that we're currently working through.
Agent: If I drill into a given opportunity, now we're seeing something again that looks similar to a lead, but it has a little bit more structure and process here as well.
Agent: And this is something that we can begin to the lead records to.
Agent: I just thought for opportunities, it makes sense to actually have a bit more of that structure So from an opportunity perspective, this is essentially representative of an y potential service that would bring in Revenue with any of the contacts that we're working with .
Agent: Anytime we see potential revenue, we can create a new opportunity record, we can work through various stages. Again, these stages, we have qualification, discovery, generate an [ORG-13], a proposal quote, negotiation and close. These are all configurable.
Agent: If you have a three-step process, we can do that. If you have a 10-step process, we can do that.
Agent: In terms of some of the key information that should get filled in or the guidance for success for each of those stages, all of those are configurable based on your own process.
Agent: The key part to this and the key takeaway is that this is a way to really start to structure and streamline that process.
Agent: So from a reporting and a KPI perspective, if you do get to a point where you're wanting to track the issue. like a forecast or a pipeline.
Agent: What's important is that everybody on the team i s classifying things in a structured standardized way so that we're no t getting, you know, different definitions of what being in a proposal quote stag e looks like, right?
Agent: Or what does negotiation look like?
Agent: We want that to be fairl y standard so that from a reporting perspective we can trust the numbers .
Agent: Down below we have again capabilities to configure whatever fields are deemed appropriate. Now again the key thing to this I would say is from an end user perspective we probably want to keep this as simplified as possible.
Agent: Like we don't want to create an overload of fields or data for your labor market coordinators to feel like they have to fill in. So we can simplify this.
Agent: We can keep this down to as as few fields as we feel are appropriate.
Agent: But just as an example, again, some of this information, we can pre-populat e like the name, the account, the hiring, the contact, bringing that all in from the accoun t information.
Agent: And then we can actually just put details about what are some of the services what are some of the job postings that are going to be available, any other types of description s or next steps.
Agent: And again, we have ou r Einstein capabilities here. [ORG-13], Choose to leverage it.
Agent: You might not but you have the flexibility of actually starting to figure out What are some of those predictors or attributes that can help move this opportunity forward?
Agent: [PERSON-4] can bring some of those insights to you proactively Again, all of your activities could be centralized in one spot and we have chatter or that collaboration where you can at mention different folks for any updates as well One thing I wanted to bring to mind here, again, something that could be a phase two or phase three down the line, but we actually have quoting tools embedded directly within [ORG-3].
Agent: So, if for whatever, whatever point in time you might want to actually generate a quote directly from your opportunities, you can actually create quotes. You can specify what are your different services.
Agent: Or product line items you might want to include within quotes You can create quote templates And this essentially again is just an extensio n of that structured process So how do you want these quotes to be sent ou t to your potential prospects or customers You can create a product [PERSON-23] of all of the different services that you provid e with different rates, with different discount capabilities different approval processes, margins all of those things you have the ability to actually embed as rule s, business rules within the coding too l. What this can ultimately do is crea te a templated document that you can then just send off to the customer and get their signature approva l, and then have that all tracked directly within [GPE-1] e. Any thoughts or comments?
Agent: Are you sending out your quotes, I guess, [DATE-1] just through email?
Agent: Is that a process that you got templated [DATE-1]?
Agent: Or how does that work?
EndUser: So our services are free of charge.
Agent: Oh,
EndUser: Okay. Yeah, so we don't bill for any of them. We track what we're delivering, but it's [MONEY-1] at [DATE-6].
EndUser: But we do send them service plans that are kind of an outline of the different deliverables and services that we're offering them. So I think that there would be a way of incorporating that in terms of.
EndUser: What's being delivered but not necessarily a charge associated?
Agent: Absolutely. Yeah, you can absolutely do. Again, that document is configurable. The type of output that you would create is configurable.
Agent: So if you wanted it just to outline the services and the service plan that you're generating for them, that's doable as well. Great. All right. And let me just go back here to the opportunity.
Agent: So once the opportunity is actually closed, the thought process here is that, let's say, for example, this opportunity was to do a series of job postings for that particular client.
Agent: If that was something that was specified in the opportunity itself, so for example, we have a list of potential roles that would have been posted upon closure of the opportunity we can actually automate that process as well So you don't have to go in and automatically creat e individual records for all of those different postings The system can actually automatically create those records and all you would be doing at that point is essentially going throug h and maybe updating some of the details You could be uploading I know one of the things that we kind of.. to talk about was how do we start to collaborate on some of those best practices and some of those postings that we've done in the past and kind of go back to them.
Agent: So you can crea te those postings. I think I recall you're using currently a [ORG-13] drive where you' re kind of collaborating on and sharing those documents.
Agent: You can share them directly he re now in context to the actual posting or the opportunity or the contact itself.
Agent: And so those are all things that you wou ld would have in perpetual, you know, for as long as you want to store th em.
Agent: And you can come back to them in context to how they were actually being us ed.
Agent: I'll go back to the can-ban because this is a little bit more on the... Career counselor perspective, but you can actually work through the Workflow for finding recruits and working through the hiring process as well.
Agent: I'll pause there.
Agent: In terms of the process, does this kind of resonate with you?
Agent: Does this feel like it could be something that the team leverages or does it just any thoughts or feedback so far?
EndUser: Yeah, no, it's absolutely something that we could utilize in leverage.
EndUser: And like you've mentioned, I think there's benefits to both sides of the team in terms of what they would need to access and need But yeah, it's definitely super relevant.
Agent: To see.
Agent: Ok, perfect. Perfect. So I will just toggle really quickly now in terms of what, again, just different viewpoints. What a labor or sorry, what a career counselor can look like.
Agent: Similar to what we kind of went through, they'll have the ability to view their book of business so their contacts, potential recruits, things like that.
Agent: But they also have the ability to really hone in on their own types of dashboards, their own types of reports and things of that nature.
Agent: So this is... Again, just a flavor of something that they could potentially view, but from a [ORG-13] r counselor perspective, they could start to prioritize what are some of the job posting s that they need to focus in on, how long have some of these been open for Again, we can use predictability, [PERSON-4], AI capabilities to figure out things lik e fill rates and fillability rates for those postings And these are filters that you can create on your own as [PERSON-13] So right now, just as an example, we have things lik e, is this an exclusive [ORG-13]?
Agent: How many days has it been opene d?
Agent: And what are the engagement terms in terms o f, is it a permanent temp or what type of rol e?
Agent: But this can be as simple as, show me all of the postings within a given regio n. Let me filter down to a particular ar ea or a particular are a. industry or a particular type of [GPE-2].
Agent: You can really make this as specific and as tailored for your career counselors as you need it to be.
Agent: And again, all of the information is dynamic, so you can go and click in and don't give you a list of all of those postings.
Agent: And you can actually drill into all of these and view the records behind here as well. You also have different views. So you want more of a working list.
Agent: You can view the different names of the postings, which one of them are actually awaiting action, upcoming interviews.
Agent: So again, this just becomes a little bit more of a working list and an actionable list for that career counselor to kind of work off of, as they're thinking about all of these different things that they need to do at a given time.
Agent: And from that perspective, if I just go into a particular job posting, again, this is sort of what they can be drilling into so they can view the actual account or the actual job record itself, the details of that job, view any of the documents or the posting details, and in terms of the Can Man view, so this is what we had seen earlier, but essentially, it kind of shows how I can add different candidates to.
Agent: The hiring process and it's as simple as kind of you know if I'm talking t o [PERSON-28] and she's actually somebody that I want to submit to th e client for review I can drag them over and what you'll notice is it actuall y prompts me with an activity so again just as an example if you wanted t o streamline some of those processes as well you can say you know for every [PERSON-22] e I move a candidate over to revie w for the client, I might want to send an emai l, a personalized email just as a heads u p. And that's something that the system can actually prom pt or we can skip the emai l. You know, they can make that [PERSON-30] thing, if I want to move this into a client intervie w, I have the ability to create an actual appointment eve nt and that can be linked to my calendar as [PERSON-13] So all of these sort of activities can be automatical ly prompted and embedded within the workflo w. So we're creatin g. more of a standardized proce ss.
Agent: And in terms of best matching candidates, you can actually, so similar to what we did from a lead perspective on the labor market coordinator side, a lead for a career counselor could be potential recruits.
Agent: So we have the ability to create different types of records, and you can specify what a lead actually is defined as for those different types of roles. So for a labor counselor.
Agent: My or a career counselor, my lead could be all of these different types of candidates.
Agent: I can be working through those leads until I get to the point where I think, hey, they're actually really great fit for a particular job posting and then I can convert them And I could use, again, you have a bunch of flexibility here but you can use your own matching rules, you can create different skills Within the system to say, hey, if a candidate meets this criteria and these skills, match it up to any of my open job postings and show me a list of all of the candidat es that have those particular skills for this particular job, or you can leverage thin gs like [PRODUCT-1] capabilities to show best matching candidates as [PERSON-13] So you really have a lot of flexibility in terms of how you want to slice that, [GPE-3] ce and dice that data to view the candidates and work through that proces s.
Agent: Yeah, and these are some examples that PEMPA together, coming out of our session, to show that it's really a business process. That's where going back to what I was mentioning, you can map these automations.
Agent: You don't have to do [DATE-7].
Agent: But when you get your reports and analytics around what is the most time-consuming, where is the most of the volume, then you pinpoint in terms of these, in terms of what cannot automate from [DATE-8].
Agent: And that's where I think like the governance.
Agent: Around the SERM Implementation is as important as the tool that you'll select, right?
Agent: So make sur e that you have that committee team, right?
Agent: You have an operating model, you have an executive level and you also have feedback with champions from the ground level for them to bring back tha t information to your system and min .
Agent: For them to take these use Cases and these business processes to be able to map them back, right?
Agent: You know, a [PRODUCT-3], especially in your type of industry, that is lead opportunity management will just go so far because it can be perceived as a big brother, right?
Agent: Versus having something that will also be a win-win in terms of you want that data and that information, right, to grow your business and your revenue, they want something.
Agent: To help do their job faster and quicker and to sell more bottom line, right?
Agent: So I would thin k through like also what are those quick wins that you can start putting in place from a n Implementation standpoint and who are those champions that will help you, you know, kick this off fas t and also help you build on the platform.
Agent: A CRM for me is never like a done product, it will alway s be evergreen because your processes will grow [DATE-9] after year especially going through an [PRODUCT-4], righ t?
Agent: S o. Just keep that in mind as well.
Agent: And then one thing I would probably add onto that too is, you know, [PERSON-9] mentioned the system admin.
Agent: Before I joined [ORG-3], I was actually the system admin for a few different customers on the other side of the fence. So I was a customer of [ORG-3].
Agent: And I think it is important to know that as a system admin, like I don't have a developer background, I don't have any encoding bone in my body.
Agent: But a lot of the things that I'm showing to you on the screen are just drag and drop clicks. There are things that are user-intuitive.
Agent: So in terms of when you're seeing all of this, it could look overwhelming because there's just so much on the screen. You can start with baby steps.
Agent: You can start by making these page layouts super simple with just the fields that you want to be able to track information on, to reflect what you're currently.
Agent: Currently doing [DATE-1] But I think to most point, as you continue to gro w and as you continue to use the system like this .
Agent: You'll just inherently start to get feedback from different users saying, hey, I want to track this or hey, it'd be really great if I can actually do something like this within [ORG-3].
Agent: And all of a sudden, as a system admin, you have all of these different ideas that you might want to actually implement.
Agent: It's great to know that you will have the power to do that versus having to rely on a vendor to go back to you.
Agent: So a lot of that configuration and the ability to even just add a new field, [DATE-10] if you wanted to or create a new report [DATE-10] have a new dashboard on the page All of that is at your fingertip s versus having to wait for a vendor to go back to yo u and pile in on those requests So .
Agent: I think through really that BA type of skill set, right?
Agent: Something, somebody that has a good business acumen, right?
Agent: That's able to, that knows the business processes.
Agent: And you don't need a full time person here, right?
Agent: It's somebody that can carve out the time in their day to day to optimize these processes. Right.
Agent: All right, the last area I wanted to dive into is again, just from an executive level standpoint, I showed you a few different dashboard examples as we were going through for a labor market coordinator versus potentially what a career counselor could see.
Agent: I thought I would show you kind of a different flavor of what a dashboard looks like. This one looks maybe a bit more simplified, but again, just as powerful and just as relevant.
Agent: So if I was an executive as an example, I might want to pull.
Agent: And information across my entire business, across all of our teams, and start [PERSON-30] to you You know, some of those KPIs that we're looking at So again, these are just examples If you're doing [MONEY-2], the services are for you charge, maybe these are not a s relevant, but ultimately what you can pull in are things like your KPIs, right So how many touch points, how many new connects, how many new employers have we connected o n a month by [DATE-9] by quarter basis I can view a leaderboard across all of my, across the entire team, all of the labor mark et coordinators, how are they spending their [PERSON-22] e?
Agent: Again, not from a big brother perspective, but just from an understanding of, you [PERSON-28], do we need to beef up on certain types of activitie s?
Agent: Do we need to, you know, double down on some sort of, some accounts more than other s?
Agent: Things like year over year growth, again, activities by rep or by labor market coordinator.
Agent: There's a lot of information on here, but ultimately, again, some of the areas that I wanted to point your attention to is it doesn't just report the news, but you can also get action oriented components as well.
Agent: If I wanted to see neglected accounts, if I wanted to see opportunities that had no next steps, these are more action oriented where I can look into and say, oh, you know what, I need to speak to Pam because she hasn't spoken to this account in quite some time.
Agent: Or maybe this is something that I'm looking at as a labor market coordinator, and I'm just now realizing like, oh, I need to, you know, go back to this employer and reconnect a little bit more frequently.
Agent: Same thing with my opportunities. Do I need to go in and bridge.
Agent: Surface some of them if some of them were just being nurtured So all of these things, these components are [PERCENT-4] configurable You can put 65 on a dashboard You can put five and make them super simple and clean But ultimately, you can make sure that you have the KPI s and the metrics that are most relevant for your busines s front and center And you can make different views for different type s for roles for different profiles, users, things of that [PERSON-21]: Any thoughts or any questions?
Agent: It's very
Speaker 4: Robust system.
Agent: There is a lot, but the one piece I would definitely emphasize is [PERSON-25], you know, keep saying this crawl a lot more on approach. This is kind of how we think about an implementation.
Agent: You wouldn't do all of this at once, right?
Agent: Like these are all things just to show you kind of what the art of the possible is. You could literally have a lead, an account, and an opportunity record, and you can make them as simplified as possible.
Agent: They can be, like I mentioned, a two-step process, a three-step process, and you can have a dashboard that has three components on it, right?
Agent: These are all things like you could potentially grow into you down the road, but it's just great to know that you're going to have potentially a system that's going to Support you and continue to grow with you as you think of different ways that you might want to evolve.
Agent: The one thing I forgot to mention on this as well is that you can drill into any one of these dashboards and get to the source report.
Agent: So again, you don't have to toggle into different systems or different views.
Agent: Like if I wanted to drill into this and see, okay, what does that actual [FAC-1] look like?
Agent: I have all the details. I can drill into the actual record or the opportunity or the account and get all the details as well. So everything is meant to be with an efficiency lens in mind.
Agent: But everything is configurable so that you can scale as you choose .
EndUser: I think it's great. I think I love the scalability and the adaptability of it. It seems like it can be customized to figure out any sort of problem or situation that may come up. So I really like it.
Agent: Yeah, and I think that's what really differentiates right the [ORG-3] platform is that It's not a one-size-fits-all, right, where you have to do the leads like this, the opportunities like this.
Agent: And it's good when you have a very traditional, small business B2B process, right?
Agent: That's very, you know. standard selling 137 motion when you start looking at the Professional services lens and you know what you need to be a little bit more acquainted to each business process.
Agent: That's where like the real value of these solutions come into play, right?
Agent: And especially knowing that you guys will continue to grow if all of us purchase to your right, it's because you're on a path growth process, right, and growth trajectory.
Agent: Because it would not be invested in life mark, right?
Agent: So as you continue to grow and scale, you can really adapt those business processes and downstream, if there's more synergies, right, to be done with shoppers.
Agent: If there's more synergies with, you know, an SHN or whatever, like area within that, in the organization.
Agent: They have the platform, right?
Agent: But these business processes can be adapted to their organizational standpoint as well.
Agent: So I would say keep that in mind as well, that You know, one, I think the message is, hey, we don't want to overwhelm you [DATE-1], right?
Agent: This is a lot to consume, right?
Agent: But think of this as the end state and mine in terms of how over like 28 to 28 month period, you could start just from that very traditional collaboration, lead opportunity space and grow your business processes once again with the opportunity, right?
Agent: Going back to your priorities that is around automation and. and so on, better efficiencies.
Agent: And then, yeah, I think the downstream is also making sure that you have the appropriate governance in place, right?
Agent: Because. It's an open platform, you can do a lot with it, but you wanna make sure that you have that appropriate Support from an Implementation standpoint to just start with that business process. We did a [TIME-2] discovery.
Agent: [DATE-13] to go through some of your business processes, people process technology, but that's really how you need to continue to think through the Implementation standpoint as well.
Agent: Any other questions?
Agent: Any takeaways that you would like before we touch on a few next steps?
Agent: Or is there anything that we didn't of use Cases that you had in mind that we never really talked about?
Agent: Touch on?
Agent: Were there any sort
EndUser: No, I think that it covered a lot. I think I appreciated seeing both sides of it from the career counselor and the labor market coordinator side. I think. It's nice to see how they are integrated.
EndUser: So I appreciated you touching on that.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: No.
Agent: Sorry Sorry about that.
Speaker 4: You cut out on me.
Agent: Anything on your side that we didn't touch on or that you would have liked to see in the demo [DATE-1].
Speaker 4: No, and later on instead, just because I deal more with the vocational counselors, so it was nice to see the Integration of how they can work together.
Speaker 4: So I think that definitely it would be a step in the right direction for us to be able to see and build to, you know, see how this could potentially grow within our business for free use for all of our providers.
Agent: Thank you for that.
Agent: In terms of your next steps, [PERSON-31], what is this something that you would like to bring forward from a recommendation standpoint?
Agent: Would you like us to look through pricing?
Agent: What are your thoughts there?
Agent: Happy to align with you on your next steps through your journey as well?
EndUser: Yeah, I would love to see a proposal in terms of pricing. I think it's like [PERSON-26] said, it's a very robust system. So I'd love to see what the [PERSON-28] tag on that would be.
EndUser: And then we can bring that forward to the next decision makers. And I'll share the Recording as well with [PERSON-26] so that she can take a look at the different functions and see how everything integrates.
EndUser: And then we can go from there.
Agent: So from a pricing standpoint, are you still looking for 23 users or what is the scope from me?
Agent: I knew you were looking at 28 full [PRODUCT-3] users and then you had additional users that as if you only, what can you maybe touch a little bit more on the difference between those two user groups?
EndUser: Yeah, so with the other [PRODUCT-3] systems that we've been demoing, it seemed to be that our labor market coordinators would be the 22 and then the 83 were the career counselors that were just more looking at those relationships.
EndUser: And so Seeing your demonstration with the Integration between the career counselors and the labor market researchers, I think it would be probably that full 137 users in.
EndUser: Yeah, the 21 was more referring to just the labor market coordinators that would be on the employer side, but it seems to be more able to integrate both sides of things.
Agent: Yeah, and you could start with the 25 right to some of the labor market standpoint and when you're ready to integrate with the counselors, then you could grow into so I will share it's going to be very easy for me you have access because I can tie you into the.
Agent: Low-loss umbrella from my standpoint, right?
Agent: Even if it's very independent, I can give you access to their preferred pricing.
Agent: So how about I put something together on that side?
Agent: We do have different user, like you could start with a very limited license. We have three levels.
Agent: In low-loss preferential pricing, you'll have access to the [ORG-22] license that has everything that you've seen here around, like the automation stand.
Agent: The outlook integrations and so on already bundled into that license and I'll provide you like this Q-level details for cheaper than the middle layer, right So I'll give you all three levels Just know that we can dance, we can dance go, but you'll have access to more functionality at a cheaper Price just based on the structure that we have in place here .
EndUser: Perfect. Oh, that sounds great.
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: And then last point, have you thought through from an Implementation standpoint, how are you looking to go about Implementation here?
Agent: Do you have an SI, an Implementation partner, who do you deal with from an IT standpoint within [ORG-22]?
EndUser: We just have our own internal IT system. So I think that we would work with you guys for that Implementation side. We don't have an Implementation partner. And this is more of that sort of internal initiative with us.
EndUser: So yeah.
Agent: Okay, so how about I give you the licensing Price and then like for the 23 users and then and I'll give you for the whole 82 if you wanted to scale to that as well.
Agent: Then if that makes sense and you guys want to pursue the discussion, then we can do a more of a scoping call. If you want to pursue those steps, right to scope out the Implementation portion of the great.
EndUser: Project. Perfect. That sounds
Agent: Sounds good.
Agent: Anything else that you need from us, any follow-up, any information you would like us to share as a takeaway?
EndUser: Just a copy of the Recording would be great and looking forward to sign up pricing and yeah, that's I really appreciated the demo.
EndUser: It seems very well adapted to our processes, so I appreciate the time that you took to put that together.
Agent: Do notice?
Speaker 4: You any answer for
Agent: Oh, no problem at all.
Agent: Happy to do it. Yeah. And from me, it's just so we're aligned from a next step in your mutual plan.
Agent: Are you still looking to take kind of like a decision before [DATE-9]?
Agent: What are your next steps there?
Agent: If I was to send you the pricing to so we understand them, we're well aligned.
EndUser: Yeah, I think ideally best case scenario, it's before [DATE-13]. And so that would be, but still what I'm aiming for at this point.
Agent: And do we need to do more of an executive, like [PRODUCT-5], with some of the leadership team here?
Agent: Because typically I'll deal with them more for the governance side and that longer term view. I'm just like, I haven't seen them as involved here. So I'm just curious to see where do we poke them
EndUser: Into the process as well.
EndUser: So from my understanding what the process would be is that [PERSON-31] and myself and [PERSON-26] will put together a proposal that will send to our national director and that national director is the one that would make that decision so.
EndUser: She may wants an additional call just to review the sort of fine details of it. But we just want to make sure that we're proposing the right system prior to.
EndUser: Yeah, to bringing that to her at that point so.
Agent: No, no, it makes sense. You guys need to do the due diligence I'm happy to, if you want to bring me in at that time, to do more of a POV, write an executive POV here.
EndUser: First, but
Agent: And we can also. if needed even put together like a business case right around like the ROI and so on. So let me know if you need any Support there.
Agent: I'm typically I'll work with my teams to craft those [ORG-13] for the executive at [LOC-1]
EndUser: Perfect. Well,
Agent: It sounds great. Great. Thank you so much for your time and you'll have a follow-up. I'm actually traveling as of [TIME-3], but by [DATE-13] you'll have the Recording and stuff.
EndUser: Together. Perfect.
Agent: Thank you so much. Have a great day.
Agent: Thank you. Thanks
EndUser: For your time.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1. ""Does this align with [ORG-9]? So can calls go through and track through that way?""

11. ""I'm typically I'll work with my teams to craft those [ORG-13] for the executive at [LOC-1]""

The sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent, such as understanding the customer's current process with [ORG-9], their quote generation and sending process, gathering feedback on the proposed system, discussing next steps, and aligning on decision timelines. They also asked about involving the leadership team and creating a proposal and business case for the executive.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the scalability and adaptability of the seller's product, noting that it can be customized to fit any problem or situation that may come up. They also appreciated the integration between the career counselor and labor market coordinator sides, and the potential for the system to grow with their business.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer: The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and demonstrating the capabilities of the seller's product. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current process for tracking and managing leads and opportunities. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's pain points and how the seller's product could address them.
2. The sales rep could have asked for more specific examples of the types of reports and dashboards the customer would like to see. This would have helped the sales rep tailor the demonstration to the customer's needs and better demonstrate the value of the seller's product.
3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's budget and timeline for implementing a new system. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's priorities and constraints, and allowed the sales rep to tailor the sales pitch accordingly.
4. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with other CRM systems and what they liked or didn't like about those systems. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's preferences and address any concerns they may have about switching to a new system.
5. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's team structure and how the seller's product would be used by different roles within the organization. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs and demonstrate how the seller's product can be customized to meet the needs of different users.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Yes, based on the transcript, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They appreciated the demonstration and mentioned that it seems well adapted to their processes. They also expressed interest in seeing a proposal in terms of pricing and sharing the recording with their colleague for further review.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They appreciated the demo and found the system to be well adapted to their processes. They expressed interest in seeing a proposal in terms of pricing and sharing the recording with their team members. They aim to make a decision before a certain date and plan to propose the system to their national director. The customer also mentioned the possibility of needing an additional call to review the fine details of the proposal. Overall, the customer seemed engaged and interested in moving forward with the deal.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if the right decision maker was on the call. The customer mentions that they will need to present a proposal to their national director for a decision, but it is unclear if this national director was present or participated in the call.

The agreed-upon next steps include the seller sending a pricing proposal for both 23 and 82 users, and the customer putting together a proposal to present to their national director. If needed, the seller is willing to participate in an executive review or help create a business case for the ROI. The customer will receive a follow-up and a recording of the call by a certain date.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""Are you sending out your quotes, I guess, [DATE-1] just through email? Is that a process that you got templated [DATE-1]?"" The customer seemed more engaged after this question as they provided detailed information about their current process and how they send service plans to customers.

2. ""Does this kind of resonate with you? Does this feel like it could be something that the team leverages or does it just any thoughts or feedback so far?"" The customer's response indicated that they were engaged and found the proposed solution relevant.

3. ""Have you thought through from an Implementation standpoint, how are you looking to go about Implementation here? Do you have an SI, an Implementation partner, who do you deal with from an IT standpoint within [ORG-22]?"" This question seemed to engage the customer as they provided information about their internal IT system and expressed interest in working with the sales rep for the Implementation process."
video_19751_167_6qr3y000000sZe2AAE,"Speaker 6: Good morning.
Agent: Good [TIME-1].
Agent: Good test. All right,
Agent: So I think we got everyone from both [ORG-1] and [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: I can only see a few different boxes down here. OK, awesome. So we will keep introductions brief. So, agenda for [DATE-1]. So again, brief introductions. I think everyone on here has met before.
Agent: We have one new team member on our site, so I'll introduce [PERSON-1]. And then we'll just do a quick recap of everything so far. And it will happen to her more of a discovery.
Agent: And alluded to that, we get [PERSON-2]. admit. Okay, got him in. And then we're thinking we'll schedule the demo. We have a good idea of what we will want to do it.
Agent: So we want to hear from you guys as well and kind of figure that out. Okay, so obviously, you know, me, [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], we brought along [PERSON-1]. She is a strategy solutions engineer over at [ORG-2].
Agent: She will primarily be observing and then working with us on the back end during our process in terms of demo building and whatnot. So, [PERSON-1], if you want to say, Hey! Yeah, nice to meet you all.
Agent: Looking forward to working with you. I've been with [ORG-2] for [DATE-2] now and [DATE-3] of that working with folks in the [ORG-3] space.
Agent: So looking forward to the conversation and digging in on your use case. Perfect. You want me
Agent: To join us?
Speaker 6: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Agent: So [PERSON-5], I know we've taken a deep dive into the portion of the areas where there's an opportunity for change and we've gone pretty granular with the currency to business.
Agent: And what I've gathered so far in high level view is that improving both the internal and external processes to make for an overall better customer experience is like the main goal.
Agent: And in turn leads to growth of the business overall.
Agent: Is that accurate and on track?
Agent: Yes, that is.
Speaker 6: Okay, awesome.
Agent: So we'll continue down that deep or that road of deep discovery with [PERSON-6]. She's going to get more like she mentioned into the deal cycle processes like that back end.
Agent: She's going to member services and then accounting and collection.
Agent: So If there's anything else you want to throw in there, otherwise [PERSON-6] is welcome to take it away. Awesome. Okay.
Agent: So the first thing that I just re-watch our Recording made sure I got all the right notes and stuff.
Agent: The first thing that I wanted to make sure we had clarity on is the difference between your member servicing and then your customer servicing. Are those reps the same people or is it your member servicing
Speaker 6: Team is new business, your customer service reps are recurring members?
Speaker 6: Like what is the difference there?
Speaker 6: There's not a difference on the same people for the account side that would be helping a member with a basic transaction will also be the one opening a new members account.
Speaker 6: With lending its split department for the new members new loans that originate from
Agent: Auto dealers or that indirect segment compared to our in lobby segment so the departments are there but they both deal with new in current. Interesting okay got you that does make sense.
Agent: All right, so from here, I would love to go through, I will walk through what I heard your deal cycle was.
Agent: And I wanna make sure that I got all of that correct and I wanna make sure that I get all of the right systems that we're touching just to make sure that we know everything we need to be integrating with and what that full process looks like, which sounds like you're the perfect guy to talk to you for that.
Agent: So from what I understand from our past conversation, they would basically fill out a form from [GPE-1], and that would be the application. It would then be sent into a pool of
Speaker 6: These emails, and that would go to the member servicing slash customer service teams.
Speaker 6: Would that also go to the loan officers, and they would pick up?
Speaker 6: Depending on which it was. If it was just a new account, or if that was the primary starting point, then that would go to a team of our supervisors and more senior member service people.
Agent: And if it's a loan application directly. to us, not through that indirect portal, then it would go straight into the emails of ou r gone officers . Okay, perfect.
Agent: So then from there, that's where the member services team or the loan officer would pick it up. It sounds like if it's more on like the deposits slash account side, the member servicing team would handle it.
Speaker 6: And is this where they would be inputting that information into like the core banking system, the card management system, those technological systems. They would input it into the core banking system and then upon completion.
Speaker 6: Then that system generates card and all the other subsequent things that come from opening that account.
Agent: The initial
Speaker 6: Okay, have to necessarily with the exception of us having yet to improve our instant issue cards a little bit, or they do some manual key, but that's all started in the core.
Agent: Gotcha. So they don't
Agent: And lobby
Speaker 6: And that's where the primary data will be housed. Okay, gotcha. Through the opening process, at least. Now, through the card management process, if we're sticking with cards, after the fact,
Agent: It's about 61-61 whether it can be managed within the core or whether they have to go into the card
Speaker 6: Provider's portal to do some things. Okay.
Speaker 6: So are those two systems connected [DATE-1]?
Speaker 6: That's good. Loosely, they're working on deepening the integration.
Agent: The hope is that we will never have to go into the card management provider system again by [DATE-4]. Okay, got
Speaker 6: You.
Speaker 6: And from like a [ORG-2] CRM perspective, what of that information are you hoping to house in the [PRODUCT-2]?
Speaker 6: Um, a lot case work, which in there.
Agent: Of it would be would start and originate
Speaker 6: So the request for a new debit card, because mine's broken in half for the chip is falling out of it.
Speaker 6: A lot of that stuff would be there as far as data that's going to be housed in card management only. The only thing that would be of use is the automated fraud system, uh, information.
Speaker 6: So a lot of transactions, um, I just swipe my debit card in [GPE-2], [GPE-3], and then all of a sudden at a fast food restaurant and [GPE-4], again.
Agent: [PERSON-7]
Speaker 6: This is going to raise some red flags, generate some automated [ORG-4] with a member via SMS.
Speaker 6: So eventually it would be nice to get those records over so tha t our staff can see wait, they were just went through [ORG-5] automated fraud detection and had thi s Interaction or .
Agent: That
Speaker 6: Detection forced them to call the fraud center at our card provider and go through their customer service. So eventually that would be great to pull over, but that's a minimal amount.
Speaker 6: And that might be a middle ground where we get those notes from
Agent: There to core through that integration. And then we can extract it from the core then and not have to build another connection. Okay.
Speaker 6: And then I heard that like the automated SMS that you would want to shoot out to them. Is that already [DATE-1] or is that something that's already done all through our fraud servicing package with our card okay.
Agent: Created
Agent: Provider?
Agent: Ah,
Speaker 6: So that's only back in data to then bring over for that 350 view for our member service people. Okay. Yeah. So when somebody contacts us,
Agent: Well, I just told you [TIME-2] I didn't make that transaction. That actually wasn't can see a note here of what your conversation was.
Speaker 6: Our internal team, but I
Agent: Ok, yeah, we're just pulling this in for visibility sake. Correct. That makes sense. All right, so that's the deposits and account side.
Agent: Going into more of the lending and the mortgage side, this is where the loan officer would handle it.
Speaker 6: They would then take that application and input it, key it into either sounds like the core of the [ORG-6], correct?
Speaker 6: The core for consumer loans, the [ORG-6] for indirect is completely self-contained. So it gets to the core at the very end, once it's been approved contract, once we know we're getting that one.
Agent: And we have the fiscal
Speaker 6: Now, mortgages has a separate mortgage origination system, and that is where they live on. Everything through the application process, much similar to
Agent: The indirect side, and then it's once again a click button push over to core.
Speaker 6: To put the loan on the system piece. OK, got you. And do you have one system where all
Agent: Of this data is living or do you have to go to that?
Agent: That is the core.
Speaker 6: That is their core business. Everything goes there at the end. But the other LOSs are doing some of that. And they're doing the lead control.
Speaker 6: The did we get this loan?
Speaker 6: And management to say, are we getting the type of balanced applications we want from this car dealer?
Agent: Then even our report
Speaker 6: All of that lives in the [ORG-6] and is mined from data there.
Agent: But
Speaker 6: Eventually it all flows back with minor things like the fraud, like some of the dealer report card things. Those live in the [ORG-6] permanently, but that's not data that's focused to member interactions.
Agent: Okay,
Agent: Got you. [PERSON-5], what is the name of that mortgage loan origination Oh, good.
Speaker 6: System?
Speaker 6: That is an encompass.
Agent: Excellent.
Speaker 6: Yeah, I figured an encompass is pretty universally integrated, but it's also very time consuming to get them on board with doing a new integration.
Agent: The brilliant thing is [ORG-7] actually has a standard [ORG-2] connector. We actually just stood that up for another one of our banking customers.
Agent: So the Integration points are going to be really key in creating this 350 degree view of the customer. other member.
Speaker 6: Okay. And then for clarification sake, [ORG-8] is our card provider. If we did end up wanting to do that, but like I said, that's very minimal data.
Speaker 6: So it might be better to just pass that through to the core when that Integration And then it's the old [ORG-9] platform that [PERSON-8] link bought.
Agent: Is done.
Speaker 6: So I think they have it classified as decision lender four. under their current portfolio, that is the [ORG-6] for indirect.
Speaker 6: And then we've had some testing with [ORG-10], lobby stuff, but we're not actively using it at this time.
Agent: Okay. Okay. Perfect, sounds good. All right, so once it goes into the [ORG-6], that does the underwriting, sounds like it'll shoot over into the core at the end of that.
Agent: If they get approved, that's where you give them their account number. Oh, sorry. I thought [PERSON-5], you had left. I was like, wait [TIME-3]. Okay, sorry. So that's what look at the account number.
Agent: They'll look for any cross-sell opportunities, pass it to whomever it needs to go to. Then it sounds like that's where they're put into those new member campaigns.
Speaker 6: Correct. And the journey by start point is very different.
Speaker 6: So that indirect journey is very much targeted letting them know who we are, that we're not just someplace they need to send a check or log in and make a payment.
Agent: At
Speaker 6: But they are a member now, whereas for the lobby they might just be in a, sure you don't want to set up an automatic payment type
Agent: When they get a new loan,
Agent: Journey. You've had automatic payments on every other loan you've ever had. I think this might have been missed when we did the loan closing. Yeah, we want to create different campaigns, different onboarding okay, yeah.
Speaker 6: So journeys depending on the product that they prefer to write. Okay, makes sense. Okay.
Speaker 6: And what current products they have, that would be the biggest thing is pulling kind of a cross sectional yes, no from the core data to say, well, you already have a checking, already have this,
Agent: You you're [DATE-5]. I do not want to send you [ORG-10] marketing.
Agent: For all my people doing this, right?
Agent: Okay. Got you. That actually was going to be one of my questions.
Agent: When it comes to segmentation and marketing, what are like the main areas you would want to slice and dice your data and it sounds like policy or policy goodness, the products that they have.
Agent: And then maybe some basic like consumer customer data, such as age. Is there anything else where
Speaker 6: You have an idea of like, Hey, I might want to slice and nice my data this way so that it can market to this segment of members.
Speaker 6: That would be a question that we definitely want to bring [PERSON-9] back into on [DATE-6]. But right now it's how they're starting their journey as new members.
Speaker 6: That is a lot of our journeys are focused on new members and how they started because that gives us the spot.
Speaker 6: We are breaking our members into more segmentation groups from the financial side right now to say these are high transaction or These people really just want to leave their money here and park their savings here and not have volume members
Agent: To worry about it. Every time you talk to them about a pecking account, they'll reopen their old checking account and never
Speaker 6: Use it and it will get close again. Okay. So, you can do the variations between the types of members they are.
Agent: Yes. And
Speaker 6: That would be a lot of simple logic that we can't do in our core right now to create variables that are easily accessible.
Speaker 6: So, from my side and a data side, I would love to not only see that they have the home banking product selected, in the core, but also see their last login, and then can break them down into active
Agent: Occasional never use.
Speaker 6: I'm so sorry, logging into what?
Speaker 6: The home and mobile banking applications. The setup and control of that is in the core, though it's a separate server, and there is tracking data in there, but there's no simple logic creation for
Agent: Me to make a variable that says, of these three categories do you fall in by
Agent: Which the last log in date?
Agent: Okay, so that's some four data we want to be bringing in. Sorry, [PERSON-10]. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
Agent: I was just going to say is a more so to see like, OK, so someone who's active, they're going to go down this journey. We're going to send them more stuff because they're obviously on their banking app
Speaker 6: Or whatever, maybe or the members app.
Speaker 6: It's basically to help distinguish say, right?
Agent: That, like, kind of
Speaker 6: So if we wanted to do a campaign to encourage remote deposit capture for our members in [DATE-7], so they're not trying to come to a branch when we might have a snow day, just using that as a broad stroke at the end poll, we don't want to target the people that never actually log in.
Speaker 6: In any ways that they just have i t so they don't get a paper statement fee . don't want to target those people with that as much .
Speaker 6: Would be a separate , here's what mobile banking can d o to make your life easier . but the Broadstroke targeted one would be groups that have it and actively they don't use this part of the service.
Agent: Use it, but Okay.
Speaker 6: Interesting. And this would be the kind of granular thing that we would do afterwards, after we started using the platform for a while.
Speaker 6: We would go in and say, okay, we want to create a sub variable of this with this basic logic string. And both our CEO and myself are good at manipulating data.
Speaker 6: We just don't have it anywhere connected enough to do that. And then generate that flag person to say, hey, this is a member that often uses remote deposit capture.
Agent: For a member service
Speaker 6: So if they come in with a check that's strange, maybe we need to inquire. And that's when we get into the fraud prevention side of it.
Agent: This is an activity out of the norm. We need to drop a little red flag. Mm hmm. Interesting. OK. All right, so onboarding starts.
Agent: Right?
Agent: They go through their campaign. When are I'm assuming that [ORG-9] has had some play in the steel cycle somewhere
Speaker 6: Where the sign is the the completion of the cycle where we'll send the documents to be signed, they'll be completed.
Speaker 6: Right now we are working on Integration decor where all those documents can be they're generated inside the core inside the core where they can be sent received and automatically scanned in because right now we export them to PDFs, upload them to the [ORG-9] web portals.
Speaker 6: Send, download a copy of the signed, and then rescan it into the imaging solution insider . Well, so we're working on cutting out those steps, but. The docu-san API is.
Speaker 6: Our self created API side of that key is giving us problems.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Is the issue that you can't get the right information into said documents?
Speaker 6: Like what's. No, it's just connectivity right now. It keeps kicking out the trial keys from the demo environment and. Just not
Agent: Playing. Yeah. Okay. Got you. I only ask because we have an Integration with [ORG-9]. Right, and obviously this would be contingent upon another Integration with the core. So.
Speaker 6: Now, what I would say that would be is part of the Workflow processes and more of the servicing. So, member submits form online to do this.
Speaker 6: Well, this is going to require a signature in step four before we can complete it.
Speaker 6: So, if we have those forms in [ORG-2], then we can send those over directly [ORG-15] and we don't have to go create it in [PRODUCT-3] or create it from a blank fillable PDF, send it out.
Speaker 6: So, that would be the side, the loan documents. Those are all going to be. generated because that's where the management of those loan applications or in [ORG-6] for other signs.
Agent: In-core
Agent: Is .
Agent: What's an example of a signature that you would have to get that wouldn't be in the core of the [ORG-6]?
Speaker 6: Let's see.
Speaker 6: Member is, Member is canceling an automatic transfer of funds between their account here that they set up through us instead of themselves and their other account had changed. So they want to cancel that.
Speaker 6: We like a signature on that stop form. So they fill out the web form version of I want to stop this, create the ticket, go through the workflow, then.
Speaker 6: Ideally, one click by our accounting department person sends them a link, they sign the form, it comes back, and then the backside is getting it back into the core for a long-term image housing, or that may be in [ORG-2].
Speaker 6: I don't know what would be the best
Agent: Route for that, but... Okay. That makes sense.
Agent: Is there anything else about that deal cycle that we missed or that you'd like us to speak to?
Speaker 6: No, I think that, well, the injectable point would be the underwriting is complete.
Speaker 6: They are approved for said loan they requested, getting into the deal cycle there to say, is there other things we should talk about before we complete this and we lose their attention.
Speaker 6: So get them not in a post wrap up, but in an injectable, I guess, cross-sale point would be And how can we cut into that cycle without being intrusive to you know, to timing, but say, well, this is a good spot .
Agent: Part of that.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 6: And that those triggers can be generated by the loan application within core being restaticed as approved ready to close.
Speaker 6: And at that point, that might be a spot where we can intercept and say, this is maybe a good time for loan officer X to talk about this.
Agent: Gotcha. Okay.
Agent: And is there any issues with how you do that [DATE-1]?
Speaker 6: Right now it's all driven by the loan they'll go through their first step would be, okay, I've approved them for the loan type they want, so they want a all alone.
Agent: Officer. Okay. Because
Speaker 6: Then I've talked about auto loan specific products like a warranty or gap insurance.
Speaker 6: Then it would be wrap back is this maybe a good person to talk about a credit card or I see they have three finance company small personal loans. Let's consolidate them for a lower interest rate.
Agent: So right now it's all driven by the loan officer and their experience. Okay. Who do you want it
Speaker 6: To be driven by?
Speaker 6: Like is there other people you'd want to pull in?
Speaker 6: It would be nice to have some small trickers to say this is a priority organizationally right now. We just issue, we just started our rewards card program.
Speaker 6: Let's talk about all, let's talk about rewards credit card with everybody that doesn't have a credit card with us. So that would be the widespread,
Agent: You know, inserting into that process as a reminder. Okay. Yeah.
Agent: So kind of like, um, maybe something that could bring up, hey, like products that potentially could be a cross-sell opportunity here, or almost just like a reminder somewhere in that deal cycle, like on your page saying, hey, remember, if of product,
Speaker 6: It's this type maybe you can bring up [ORG-15] as well. Right. Okay. Gotcha.
Speaker 6: And it would be other I don't know how to differentiate this and explain this, but like I said, the loan products specifically like the insurances and coverages, those are already built into our cycle.
Speaker 6: Their loan devalues over a certain point. We need to talk about gap. It wouldn't be those kind of products. It would be more credit union-wide. You've had an auto loan.
Agent: Now let's talk about a mortgage. You've got an auto loan. Let's talk about checking a account. Yeah, exactly.
Agent: One thing that piques my interest here is that you said you were cross selling based on the experience of the loan officer.
Agent: How, how experienced are your loan officers?
Speaker 6: Do you have some loan officers that are newer and may not have that experience that could We do have some more junior and and it cycles out. I was on a loan officer desk for [DATE-8].
Speaker 6: Our loan manager was on the desk for [DATE-9] with me.
Agent: So, you know, we cycled out newer people came in. So providing areas where like just on your page, you could say, hey, maybe at this step, you should be doing this.
Agent: At this step, you should be thinking about cross selling opportunities, right?
Agent: Just to help them speed up.
Speaker 6: That I guess onboarding you could call it or just like their educational experience. for it.
Speaker 6: And if a lot of the contact origination, the [PRODUCT-2] up as kind of that second piece, then we know that, okay, well, that's here before I just go to my next step.
Agent: If they're going to have
Agent: Going to be part of my process to look back Okay.
Speaker 6: But if it's always up, you know, there doesn't have to be a core, I click this button trigger, but
Agent: We can get the trigger to constantly go back at this part of your process and see if there's anything here for me. Yes. Okay, got you, interesting .
Agent: And then is any of this information that we talked about during the deal cycle held in 8 by [DATE-10]?
Agent: Because I know that we were talking about how you feel like your customer service reps
Speaker 6: Kind of feel paralyzed because they don't know what's happened with the member so far.
Speaker 6: So the deal cycle, if the member calls in and gets somebody they're going to go look at the application status within the core because they're already going to be there.
Agent: In our call center,
Speaker 6: But if they have the text message from loan officer X saying, you know, we're going to have the wait to get underwriting approval, I'll be back to you day after tomorrow, what's it?
Speaker 6: They don't if it's not added into the notes of the loan application.
Agent: Have that piece necessarily
Speaker 6: So that's the piece where the [PRODUCT-2] is, okay, I'm pulling that completed text conversation in the recap that's put into,
Agent: You know, that Outreach program and pulling it back in and unifying it into one spot. Yeah, exactly. It's your, you're missing engagements unless they're like manually keyed in.
Speaker 6: Kind of like
Speaker 6: Correct. Okay.
Agent: So then what is held in eight by eight?
Speaker 6: There's, I guess, CRM aspect. Right now it's just the dispositions from the call center. Okay. So it's just server side.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 6: Um, because that's the only team that has direct access to that. And then that's where having a full [PRODUCT-2] would be our goal of this is where everything is.
Speaker 6: And even if Contact is like our one two many text, mass text program.
Agent: Made in a separate program
Speaker 6: We get the fact that goes back and then the trigger of, hey, that conversation once it moved from a one two many to a one-on-one conversation.
Agent: Was marked complete
Agent: Now let's get the wrap up of that and bring it over here. Okay. That makes sense.
Speaker 6: Is that texting capability that you were talking about?
Speaker 6: Is that also an No, that's in a separate platform called UltraP.
Agent: 8-by-8?
Speaker 6: Ultrap?
Speaker 6: L-t-r-o-p-h-y. And right now we use that for collection blasts as well as some specialized marketing.
Speaker 6: So for instance, all of our members that are going to get a late fee if they don't make their payment [DATE-1], they get a SMS blast for that versus a standard
Agent: [PERSON-10] that says your loans behind. Gotcha. Okay. All right, so then at this point, I'd probably want to hop into more of like the member servicing that we were already alluding to.
Agent: Is there anything else like that deal cycle side the loan officer
Speaker 6: Stuff that we missed that you want to talk about.
Agent: No,
Speaker 6: The one thing is our mortgage department is a separate entity. Oh, so when they wrap with a member, they've not had any exposure exposure to our consumer side.
Speaker 6: Unless our mortgage law officer specifically says, Hey, I want to refinance your like to get your debt to income ratio down and save you $[MONEY-1] a month.
Agent: Car loan because I'd really
Speaker 6: Unless there's a reason as part of the mortgage cycle, getting those mortgage people then
Agent: In connection with the consumer loans is a very good cut over Okay, I mean, how does the mortgage side cross sell and not sell if they don't have?
Speaker 6: I mean, do they have access to that other data through the core?
Speaker 6: Yes, they can still see it and all the data from the credit reports, obviously, on there. So that's data rich when you're going through those things.
Speaker 6: And eventually that would be all the credit report data is stored in a data table within our core.
Agent: Another trigger point is
Speaker 6: So we can create transition flags, you know, every new loan, scrub the credit report.
Speaker 6: Do they have multiple vehicle so, this is a perfect loans on there?
Agent: If refinance or car loan opportunity to then create its own [PRODUCT-4] entry. Yeah, that would be really cool. Okay. I like this.
Speaker 6: There's so many moving parts, [ORG-15] integrations that you could make something very cool and very obvious. This is the problem of financial institutions. We've got all the data you could ever want.
Speaker 6: If we can ever parse it, sort it and clean it.
Agent: Right?
Agent: This is, trust me, this is something we see all the time.
Agent: Right?
Agent: It's all about, hey, how can all of these different systems work together so that we can actually make this data actionable?
Agent: Yeah, we see it time and time again. Okay, so moving into more of this member servicing customer service side of things. Okay.
Agent: What does the, I guess, ongoing communication with a member look like?
Speaker 6: So very much it's a one time one time. So we don't have specific member service representatives for specific members.
Speaker 6: And somebody in a branch location can serve us and help a member that is * miles away closer to another Okay.
Agent: Branch.
Speaker 6: So the [ORG-4] may open with my debit card. It's not working, which then [ORG-19] can go in and start the form for them, which then generates our case and the Workflow off of that.
Speaker 6: And then upon completion, then they would be back and there'd be no connection between that cause that call center representative and that member until they call back and again.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Where's that case information being held?
Speaker 6: Right now it's done in an internal ticket system for some of the more advanced things, but most of the workflows are a job form, web form into an email. Pardon me.
Speaker 6: And then from there, somebody says, I'm taking this one. I'll help [PERSON-9] and they hold that until they complete it. But there's no step by step Workflow in there.
Speaker 6: And that's mostly because of just the clunky limitations of our current internal ticket system, which is more meant for IT help desk, not for fraud interactions.
Speaker 6: So that's where the ticket system part of the request we had sent in and false is that we really want to get that.
Speaker 6: Everything becomes a case, whether it's originated from us or a member and there's always a spot to say, this is where we are on this. We're on step three.
Speaker 6: And then [PERSON-9] brought this up with the endpoint to endpoint analysis, then we can go back and say, why is the time from step three two step four always three That doesn't make sense.
Agent: Days?
Speaker 6: This should not take this long.
Agent: Do you, are you able to get like insights [DATE-1] about how long these cases are taking?
Speaker 6: Yes, if I go manually pull data from seven different spots and say, when did it hit the, when did When did the email get sent to accounting?
Agent: The form get submitted?
Speaker 6: And then when did it, this happened It's not connected.
Agent: In this system?
Speaker 6: Those things don't
Agent: Flow together. Okay. Got you. So with the JOT forms that are coming in.
Agent: Thanks How many different [PERSON-15] forms do you have when it comes to just like the ticketing or the servicing aspect?
Speaker 6: For coming in.
Speaker 6: I can't answer that. This is an [PERSON-15] question because that's her thing.
Speaker 6: I know we have approximately 50 to 82 total forms, but that includes the different versions of our consumer I would say there's at least 32, and that's also including internal forms that are generating So if member calls and says, I need this done, I'll fill out the drop form associated with that.
Agent: Loan applications.
Agent: Those workflows.
Speaker 6: And that kicks the process to the back office function
Agent: That takes care of it. Okay.
Agent: So my question is, is would be, excuse me, why do you have so many different ones?
Agent: Like, is there no way to aggregate all of these to be in one form?
Agent: Like maybe you have drop downs or something that show the different options.
Agent: Like, why is there 47 of them?
Speaker 6: Because it's easier to have a single landing page with, I need to do this, click this and this form has for the exact information I need to collect.
Speaker 6: Then trying to say, well, I'm in the service form page now, select the dropdown, do this, do this. It's more getting the minimum amount of information. That's one of the big philosophies of our CEO with member interactions.
Speaker 6: I mean, we've all seen abandonment ratios for online retailers and how that's such a, you know, target for them.
Speaker 6: But we would rather have a loan application where we've got to call and get 19 pieces of, successive, let's say three pieces more information, but we got the application to get started, then have them abandon it because we're asking them to re-input their social Security number and type out the full vehicle then.
Speaker 6: Number in the application where we're going to get documentation later that has that . Okay.
Agent: Does that philosophy make sense?
Agent: Yeah, no, it does. Absolutely. You don't want to make your perspective members have to refill out all and again again.
Speaker 6: Of this information again Right?
Agent: Like you need to finish a form
Speaker 6: If it's short and simple. And with that, Since job form is not integrated with our core, there's no form filling capability.
Speaker 6: So that would be an interesting piece is if we had these forms to create tickets through the [PRODUCT-2] published on our website, if they input some basic have an entry, then it can pull everything else from there that we want two form fill so that when that form gets to our accounting department, it's got all the pieces of information they need, but not all of them are filled out by.
Agent: Information and they already
Agent: Okay. Well, also, yeah, if so, if you already have the member information [PRODUCT-2] integrated with the core.
Speaker 6: In the
Agent: And then they come into your website, they fill out a form and they submit that. So the way that [ORG-2] works is it would be able to say, hey, like this is associated with this person's account.
Agent: So really, I mean, like, excuse me, I'm forgetting word right here, but it would be able, the member service there would be able to see all of that information and all that core information right through [ORG-2], right, without actually having to navigate to the court at all.
Speaker 6: Is that like a real estate?
Speaker 6: Yes, and I'm going to continue ticket.
Agent: To call it a ticket just for easy I'm sorry.
Speaker 6: Yes. The men if the member needed to input five pieces of information but to complete the process associated with that ticket, we needed 10 other pieces of information that's already in [ORG-2].
Speaker 6: Could [ORG-2] pull that and then fill out one complete start and take form for that process so that it's in one you're saying like on the website, [GPE-5]Agent: Place?
Agent: So
Speaker 6: So no, so our member puts in the five pieces that they need and then their name reference points.
Agent: And phone number as the
Speaker 6: Then when that comes in and gets cleaned into the start of case for this servicing aspect. then [ORG-2] fills in the blanks with what's needed for the people downstream So
Agent: They don't have to go and get it and bring it into that case.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Speaker 6: Yeah, okay I see well what would they like what would those people downstream need?
Speaker 6: Do you have an example if they need to find out what's wrong with the debit card?
Speaker 6: So that debit card information, let's say we need the last four of it to look it up, it's stored in the core and we can create that cross reference to go pull that last four without asking the member to put it into a webpage, type it in, worry about [ORG-24] compliance and such and we just need that last four.
Speaker 6: So instead of them having to go back to core, go to the card screen, two start what they need to start, it's already there.
Agent: Pull that last four Okay.
Speaker 6: Because we've injected that
Agent: Data pull into the middle of the process before it gets to the service side . Okay, well, theoretically, wouldn't we have pulled that financial information into [ORG-2] already
Speaker 6: Upon, you know, the creation of said card?
Speaker 6: And it could be. I mean, card numbers are always one of those weird things where, you know, you have to have special data compliance to store them.
Speaker 6: So is it better to leave them just in the core and only bring in [DATE-10] when we need it as opposed to keeping it then we're exposing more there all the time?
Agent: Because data. vulnerability and required standards. Yeah, so from a compliance and [ORG-24] standpoint, that might require more discussion. Gotcha. OK, that's good to know.
Agent: So it sounds like the ticketing that we've talked about so far is either they're calling in or they're like at a physical branch or they're filling out an application on a website. Correct.
Speaker 6: What about the chat, like the live chat option that you guys offer. So that would be the same because right now it is just interacting with a direct person. We're not using a robust chat bot at this time.
Speaker 6: But. The person on the other end, just as if they were input the ticket with the information and start that process in that point then for the other areas to...
Agent: On phone, would
Agent: Perform that task. Okay.
Agent: Is that chatbot only used for member servicing?
Speaker 6: Online chat, it's currently yes.
Agent: Okay. That's it.
Agent: And then who's on the end of that?
Speaker 6: Is it one person all the time?
Speaker 6: Do you have any?
Speaker 6: It's our call center. So our call center people will enter phones. They'll take a chat and [NORP-1] themselves unavailable until they finish it.
Speaker 6: If we're very busy times or [DATE-9] [TIME-4] in particular, they'll be doing both at the same time.
Agent: They'll have one call, two chats. Yep.
Agent: Okay, so what about like routing?
Agent: How does it route when a chat's coming into, you know, whatever rep, or
Speaker 6: Is it just whoever picks it up?
Speaker 6: It's just whoever picks it up. We do have the ability to do specialty based routing. It's not something we do. Our call center is typically some of our most seasoned service people.
Agent: Member
Speaker 6: So they are well equipped to answer a lot of questions. And if it's not to them, then it's more, OK, we're going to pass this information along to our lending team.
Speaker 6: And they're going to get a hold of you. We don't I don't have an answer to that quite yet. So I need to get a hold of our title processing. And so I'll submit a request to them and
Agent: Then title processing will reach back out. Okay. And then the actual like internal view of that chatbot for the rep is that in one specific software, is it
Speaker 6: Integrated to anything like what does that look like. It's in a standalone software. Right now it's [PERSON-15]. Once we get the Integration capability into our mobile app working, we're having some conflicts there.
Speaker 6: It will be part of the general A by Oh, OK.
Agent: E context center suite.
Speaker 6: Perfect. So that'll be once again, all the data can be mined through that one connection omni channel.
Agent: To the
Speaker 6: And that's our end goal is to truly have an omni channel and only one spot
Agent: With some very small exceptions.
Agent: Ok. Do you like this chat bot?
Agent: Or would you be interested in looking at [ORG-2]'s jump bot?
Speaker 6: As a chat bot, yes, that's something we are interested in and it's something we have talked about.
Speaker 6: The company I did reference earlier, [ORG-15], they have an an AI-enabled chatbot and an insert into the IVR menu for your call center phone system to have the [PRODUCT-5]-backed chatbot and do some call deflection.
Agent: [PERSON-19] calls
Speaker 6: So that is something more interested in, but until we get the downstream effects of categorizing and marking all those touch points,
Agent: It's further down the list. Okay, got you.
Speaker 6: So not something we should be really spending too much time on. I would say not right now. I don't think there'd be a problem with moving chat to [ORG-24] and provided a lot of ease.
Agent: If that provided
Speaker 6: But I don't think [ORG-2] wouldn't become a full omni-channel in the sense it's not going to provide the SMS and it's not going to provide the context and our phone number routing the CCAS parts, correct?
Agent: It can. Yeah. Now we're talking like a couple more products and such.
Agent: I think for like from a crawl walk run perspective, I like the idea of sticking with sales, but it might, you know, be worth looking into some of these other products and it could be an Integration or again we have, we have our own chatbot for example.
Agent: Right, that we could show you and it probably does something very similar. In fact, we have an omni channel.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Where we have, you know, cases from different channels coming into it and then your member service reps would be able to pick them up. So in a way, yeah, I do think that we could become your omni channel.
Agent: But for like the from the confines of now.
Speaker 6: The project for let's keep the scope narrowed.
Agent: Yes,
Speaker 6: Yeah. And especially I don't want to get down this rabbit hole without [PERSON-15].
Agent: She is the one that
Speaker 7: Manages low surfaces. Okay. They also just a quick ad. They signed a [DATE-15] agreement with eight by eight [DATE-15]. So it'd be kind of double paying for a service anyways.
Speaker 7: So I don't know if that's the best.
Agent: You might as well not focus on that. Totally fine. Integration works as well. We do that. So we can focus Good to know.
Speaker 6: On that for now.
Agent: All right. Thank
Speaker 7: You, [PERSON-24]. Appreciate that insight.
Agent: Had that had to come off of the first one part of the meeting at least. Right. You're like, no, we got this. Perfect.
Agent: Okay, anything else about member servicing, right?
Agent: It just sounds like they in one place,
Speaker 6: Need to be able to see everything right?
Speaker 6: They don't have that ability. Processes through and through. Yeah. If all the processes, all the tickets, all the, hey, we're waiting on this can be in one spot that
Agent: Provides a lot of ease and a lot. It takes away a barrier of entry for new staff. Yeah, exactly. Okay, a lot of that. All right. So I want to touch really, really quickly.
Agent: I know we're running out of time on the collections and accounting because I heard that you guys said that those are part of your teams, but they really haven't been brought up yet.
Agent: So could you tell me a little bit about their processes,
Speaker 6: Their softwares, and how you envision them using [ORG-2]?
Speaker 6: So our accounting team mostly lives within the core. That's and all the back end banking things happen.
Agent: Where all of our [ORG-15]
Speaker 6: So there's going to be very little there that directly impacts it as well as their external software that houses some of their rectilations and things. There'll be very few touch points there, but their process will be more so.
Speaker 6: Okay. There's a request now for return of a fraudulent charge.
Speaker 6: So they would need to not only do their process, but they're going to track in that same Workflow manner that we talked about for the other service aspects that the has this part been done. Okay.
Speaker 6: Now the member needs to be contacted. I select, okay, we want to do email and we have to legally do letters. So I checked those boxes that this is how that's goes.
Speaker 6: And maybe there's an automatic candy email that goes out through [ORG-2] from our email address and then they can print the letter from the core that's in the documents. for keeping and mail that out .
Agent: It's gonna be a small process like that .
Speaker 6: Will not have a lot of touch points . Okay.
Speaker 6: Would you?
Speaker 6: Oh, sorry.
Speaker 6: I would say their touch points are going to be in the back end in the sense that a lot of what our member service people will start when they're talking to a member accounting may be the ones that have to finish the process or might have to execute.
Agent: So they're only going to be taking the back end of these work full processes. Okay. Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to ask.
Agent: It sounds like they're the like the downstream actions that you were looting to Okay, got you.
Speaker 6: Before.
Agent: More
Speaker 6: Collections team. Our collections team utilizes right now. We data mine out of our core to their own reports and their own kind of tracking dashboards. But they have to note everything back.
Speaker 6: There's a separate notes module within our core for collection only. And in there are triggers and untriggers for things. So, for instance, somebody initiates a [LAW-1] bankruptcy.
Speaker 6: So now they get automatically excluded from getting the mail and text notifications for these things. Okay, so that's where we kind of have a lot of our regulations and tracking They would note everything.
Agent: In.
Speaker 6: Ideally, we'd only want them to note things to one place. So whether that's a always on connection, they noted in core where they're used to, or whether they note it.
Speaker 6: Pardon me within the [PRODUCT-2] and then we can get a flow back to the core collection notes where then it can trigger the downstream effects of Do not mail these people collection notices or do not put them in a collection contact list because they are Exempt because of this ongoing bankruptcy.
Agent: Let's say yeah, so just really holding Member information that would help them do their job, right?
Speaker 6: And then also trigger back to the member service people. So [PERSON-24] [ORG-32] was repossessed. So we need to not accept a payment on it right now because it is going through the repossession process.
Speaker 6: Instead, that needs to be deposited into savings.
Speaker 6: Right now, that is one of many of what we call stop notes in the core screen that pops up when their account is brought up to say, hey, you need to know this.
Speaker 6: You have to acknowledge this before you can move forward.
Speaker 6: So that would be the other thing is creating that trigger effect that says, well, there's this big red note that tells me that this car has been taken and I need to contact our collections team right now.
Agent: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. Just working together. It sounds Yes, it makes sure you're reaching out to your members in the right like.
Speaker 6: That
Speaker 6: Way, you know. But it also declutters the idea there. The hope of a [PRODUCT-2] is to declutter pieces of that and say, well, here's what I need to do with this member.
Speaker 6: I can see it right here from collector A that we need to do this when they call in.
Speaker 6: But instead of having seven of those notes in bright red, because they're all high importance, we can have maybe a cleaner way to do that that's not the core just stopping me from doing what I'm doing.
Agent: Yeah, OK. All right, anything else about those two teams?
Speaker 6: No, I know collections is very text based. Text based. And they use the system that sends the blasts for reoccurring. So you are [DATE-15] delinquent. And then from there, they spawn those into individual conversations.
Speaker 6: So that is a big part of their Workflow because SMS is just easier to get people to OK. getting that.
Agent: Respond. Mm-hmm. So go ahead.
Speaker 6: Oh, can finish your thought.
Agent: No, no, sorry.
Speaker 6: You I was just going to say getting that data back is a big piece, just that, oh, this person's been in contact with collector aid. They, their last SMS conversation ended [DATE-19] at [TIME-5].
Agent: Okay. Question here.
Agent: How do you like your mass texting software?
Speaker 6: We do like it. There's always room for improvement and it's not something that we couldn't look to maybe inject something else. I will say the conversion from one two many to one two one is the big selling point.
Speaker 6: Because we send out to everybody, but when they respond it goes back to the particular subgrouping it needs to and then it creates that one-to-one conversation. Similar to how a chat comes in.
Speaker 6: But it all started from the, we're sitting this out to 1061 people because there's 1004 people that are going to get a late fee [DATE-1] if they don't make their payment.
Agent: Gotcha. Okay.
Agent: And then does that do they text through that software?
Speaker 6: Are they able to?
Speaker 6: Yes, they text through that web based interface.
Agent: Okay. So they're kind of out of like multiple different softwares Interesting.
Speaker 6: Right now. Yes. Okay.
Agent: Okay. Let's
Speaker 6: See.
Speaker 6: And with that, one other thing since we're talking about that software, we do some notification things like your first payment is going to be due for those indirect members that sign the contract, leave with a car, probably never read that contract.
Agent: Messages,
Speaker 6: It's just a, hey, we want to let you know your first payments do, but here's also some different ways you can make your payment if you want to set it up automatically.
Agent: Notifications that just
Speaker 6: That kind of thing. I mean, we've tried in extreme situations to do notifications of branch closings to we had a branch close because of inclement. Well, whether right after we merged with that credit union.
Speaker 6: So we really wanted to get that personalized touch out. Now, unfortunately, that big of a text plus typically gets you flagged by the carriers and causes all kinds of problems, but Okay.
Agent: Bye. All right, I feel pretty good about the billion in five questions this time.
Agent: I've asked you at
Agent: Is there anything else about this massive process, right, over the last two meetings that we've had that you feel we didn't touch on and we should be talking about?
Speaker 6: No, I think we've hit most of all the big points and kind of all everything that fell into that RFP general process of what we're thinking.
Agent: So. Yes. Okay.
Speaker 6: Agreed. All right, we'll say we did in that in our conversations outline all the possible data points.
Speaker 6: But like we talked about with the card processor, not all of them are requirements of the scope It's more of a nice thing or more of a if we get this data into something that we're already connecting the [PRODUCT-2] me bullet through that of the project.
Agent: To, give way. Yeah, exactly.
Agent: And so like when we actually do a demo, we'll show you just like some examples of, hey, you know, this information could be here, that field could be there, but really when we're going through that, like we can talk about that.
Agent: You know, what information are you really thinking you want to pull through, right?
Speaker 6: It's going to be more theoretical and it's going to be a visual for us to really Some data will be things that will be more in the background.
Agent: Talk through some of that information.
Speaker 6: They're going to be more for data mining after the fact and being connected to all the other data within [ORG-2]. As opposed to we want to show all this flood of
Agent: Data on the main screen to our member service people as soon as they pull up a member.
Agent: Yes, okay.
Agent: Okay, that's good information.
Speaker 6: Well, thank you so much for answering all my questions [PERSON-5]. [PERSON-5] you passed the test.
Agent: Actually,
Speaker 6: The
Agent: Other way around you would have preferred [PERSON-15] because her much more succinct answers as opposed to my stories. No, I think honestly storytelling, at least for me, I can envision things a little bit easier, maybe
Agent: Not for other brains, but I think you did a wonderful job. And [PERSON-15] wanted to add something, I think.
Agent: I have a question, and there may not be [QUANTITY-1] of time to fully unpack this, but just wanted to get some of your thoughts.
Agent: Because I think [PERSON-24] at the beginning of the call that one of the main things that we're trying to solve here is removing silos, getting data in front of multiple people, having a single source of truth, and that full 3.632459024591546 degree view of our customer.
Agent: And that is absolutely fantastic, something we do all the time. But the other theme that I'm hearing a lot of is taking
Speaker 6: Data and making it more actionable.
Speaker 6: Is that a theme for the company, [PERSON-5], that we're picking up on correctly ?
Speaker 6: Yes, and I don't know if [ORG-2] will always be the method to do that. It may be the intermediary to kind of
Agent: Aggregate some of these little pieces. And then from there, we can create the action steps downstream. whether we are like fully actionally making that data actionable or if we're just one of the pieces that's making that data actionable.
Speaker 6: It's something that we want to make sure that we understand and are aware of. So tell me a little bit about why right now.
Agent: That matters to the company
Speaker 6: Well, right now, and it's the member touch points is the primary reason.
Speaker 6: It's that we interact with our members in so many different ways and we don't have that one spot to get that full view of these are all the interactions. And then from there, if we can make those interactions.
Speaker 6: Less stressful for the member and give them a kind of a just a better experience. That's what our Got it.
Agent: [ORG-23] is.
Speaker 6: I'll throw a intermediate example that would be great eventually is that if a member submits said case and let's say we built an Integration to our home and mobile banking software.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-15] and [PERSON-32]'s [ORG-6] has what they call the pizza menu of tracking how your application or your process of this goes and seeing what phase you're in phase three of four.
Speaker 6: This is how much longer we think it'll be before this is done.
Speaker 6: And if we could eventually get data into that point where members can see that I started this Workflow to get a new debit card and this is where it is. The box has been checked.
Speaker 6: It's waiting for me to pick up at the branch here or this type of thing.
Speaker 6: That would be the long term way, you know, down the road ultimate goal is to then get that information back to the members to because if we can deflect.
Speaker 6: Calls [DATE-24] that are where are we in the process to get my new debit card ready?
Speaker 6: Um, [TIME-6] after we just had that call, that would be a great plus.
Agent: [PERSON-23], do you all know like how many calls [DATE-24] you are getting?
Agent: Like I'm thinking about like, Hey, * deflecting * calls in [DATE-24]. Like what portion of your calls too ambitious of a number.
Speaker 6: Would that be potentially?
Speaker 6: Sorry. That was probably
Speaker 6: Okay, that would definitely be something for to as we're kind of talking.
Agent: Bring up to [PERSON-15]
Speaker 6: Because the last set of numbers I have in front of me are from [DATE-15] when we first started talking to [PERSON-24] about new call center stuff.
Agent: Awesome. Okay, totally fair. Just asking more for ballpark.
Speaker 6: So that's great. Yes, 340 is probably far too large any of those situations.
Agent: Of a number for
Agent: But that brings up a good point as well, [PERSON-5], that you might want to be aware of is that a lot of this project is around, like, how can we actually capture data in the first place, right, [PERSON-5]?
Agent: Like, knowing that, knowing how many cases are coming through is something that you're interested in knowing, since you don't know it now.
Agent: And then the Marketing team talked about, like, we want to know how many leads are coming and we don't necessarily know that those answers right now.
Agent: Is that correct?
Speaker 6: I will say we always know how many cases there are for each type because we can see the number of forms that are started. We don't know where they go from there.
Speaker 6: So we know the starting points of a lot of things.
Agent: We don't know where they go throughout the process.
Speaker 6: And from the similar vein, we can see how many applications were submitted. We can see how many loans were dispersed of that type as an instance, but tracking the individual person through their experience.
Speaker 6: That is something we can't do. or tracking the holes in a specific process.
Agent: That makes sense and I'm thinking about when you mentioned to you're like, hey, I'm really comfortable manipulating data, but there's just the data isn't in a single place for me to even do that.
Agent: It sounds like this would maybe fall in that category as well
Speaker 6: To some or manipulating the data before it gets to Okay.
Agent: The right people.
Speaker 6: So anybody can go for menus deep and see if this member's used their debit card in [DATE-24].
Speaker 6: But if I can get that in front of them as a little checkbox in the upper right that says actively using debit card.
Agent: Yeah, then it's way more practical that they're actually going to do that, that they're actually going to pull that into their conversation with the member all those things.
Speaker 6: And then it also builds into just general conversation of how do we improve this, or getting a lot of these type of members that are calling in for this reason, and then we can see if a process needs improvement.
Agent: Awesome. Okay, that makes sense. That's helpful.
Agent: Awesome.
Agent: Yeah. You want
Agent: To talk to you next steps?
Agent: Yeah, you know, I was just like kind of visualizing like me as a customer, like I bank with [ORG-24], and I'm thinking about the communications that I get and them saying, okay, we have private client, you know, we have a more injury of this and having an all in one central area does get that full 350 view like that's really the overall goal of this and it's not so much you don't have the data.
Agent: It's the fact that the current things in place aren't able to show you. I guess kind of like the organization of it all in layman's terms right now. So, okay, cool. Just wrapping my brain around all that.
Agent: Okay, so for next steps, since we have, well, we don't really have everyone on the call. So maybe it's best if I give [PERSON-15] a ring.
Agent: Our goal is to do a demo [DATE-15], I'm going to call week of the fourth of March.
Agent: It [DATE-15], the
Speaker 6: So I think probably what I'll do is I'll give them in a ring.
Agent: I don't know, is she It'll be hit or miss.
Speaker 6: Out of pocket [DATE-32] [DATE-1]?
Agent: You could probably send her an email and she can probably give you a time. Yeah. I'll do that. And my hope is to have everyone on that call, um, all the different stakeholders and whatnot.
Agent: And that way, well, obviously Recorded as well, but just to get everyone there to have their input. I'm sure there'll be some more questions from both sides.
Agent: Um, and that's kind of the next step that I think we want to do.
Agent: Is there anything else you can think of [PERSON-4] that in Well, you tell us [PERSON-5], like, are we going through the appropriate avenues the media?
Speaker 6: To get that demo scheduled?
Speaker 6: Is there anything else that's important for the union to see for us before that demo?
Speaker 6: I will say that we don't want to bring in our entire leadership team at this stage.
Speaker 6: We would like to do a demo first and we'd like to have some discussions, very preliminary discussions on pricing and what this could look like.
Speaker 6: We're going to be the filtering stage of that and then we will open up to both the specialty groups I'm going to talk about last time with our Enterprise Risk Management.
Speaker 6: Looking to mitigate specific risks and our member friction team trying to eliminate those frictions for members where things don't go smoothly as we'd like. So those teams and our leadership team would probably be a phase two of demos.
Speaker 6: Once we've asked some more specialized questions, we've kind of closed some loops and then we can also relay those will be more direct comparison demos at that point.
Speaker 6: So we'll have our field narrowed down to the I don't want to say finalist. I'm not going to say it's guaranteed down to a final two, let's say, but we'll have the field narrowed down.
Agent: And then we're not bombarding them with 24 demos. Totally. So kind of like a dry one with you guys first, this
Speaker 6: Immediate team that we've been working with so far. And then fine tune that for the other two teams that you mentioned. Well, three teams and those will be one.
Speaker 6: So then we'll bring in our leadership team for all the stakeholders that want to be involved and we'll bring in some of the specialized groups that will be people that are below the manager level that want to give input and that are.
Speaker 6: Let's say the stakeholders for specific cases like our deceased member process. We'd probably bring in the person from our call center that runs that process because it is the poster child of
Agent: We really need to do in point looks at where we're slow and where this may take longer than we think it should to provide the best experience for the member. Okay. Um, I know we had previously talked
Speaker 6: About a rough [DATE-23] timeline.
Speaker 6: Is that still in line of sight?
Speaker 6: Given the different teams, we will be demoing and just bringing into the call different stages.
Speaker 6: Right, so what our phase is?
Speaker 6: We will have our initial review and our initial narrowing of the field towards [DATE-24].
Speaker 6: That is when we will meet with the leadership team, make our recommendations, how we think things should move forward, some clarifying requests from individual stakeholders. And then from there and [DATE-23], that would be the second demos.
Agent: That would be the more specialized
Agent: Conversations and really moving into the latter two stages of our decision making process. Got it. Okay. Just writing this all down. Alrighty, so what that being said, I know we're just over time.
Agent: I appreciate you taking the time and being so open with all of our questions. I know we threw a lot at you. Kind of like, you all did a great job [DATE-1].
Agent: So I will give a ring to a man, [PRODUCT-6] should or any know, like you said, and then we'll start coordinating and getting all those things in place. I'll probably put an evaluation plan together
Speaker 6: Just because there are a lot of moving parts. And then that will give us all just something to look at and refer to.
Speaker 6: So anything else you'd like to add and think we didn't touch down on [DATE-1]?
Speaker 6: Um, the, let's see. There were a few special questions towards the end of that RFP document that was forwarded along to you guys, things like single scion capability and.
Speaker 6: Those are bullet points, those can be an email after the demo. They don't need to take
Agent: Up talking time and space, but I would just like to know going in because those are things in our decision making matrix. Just some basic answers to some of those questions. Okay, I'm sorry, I missed that first part.
Agent: Did you say there was an email
Speaker 6: That was sent over.
Speaker 6: I do believe an RFP was sent and it might have been sent to [PERSON-24] and I don't know if it got flown through, but that was just our attempt to scope the project and give the details.
Speaker 7: We're already well done that road though. I don't think you really needed it honestly.
Speaker 6: Okay, I guess the three big technical pieces on there was, is there an [ORG-24] built into your typical contract. is the single-silon capability possible.
Speaker 6: We're looking to migrate a lot of our platforms to single-silon on over [DATE-24], let's say. Heck, [PERSON-24] probably knows that time frame better than me because he's
Speaker 7: Always working a little bit like this. Sooner than that, I think you guys are already almost there. You're using, you're good though. Yeah, you're getting
Speaker 6: Down the road there. So that would be a big possibility. And then we've went through most of the vendor list, but at some point we need to check off these vendors.
Speaker 6: We don't think are right to integrate data so that we can internally say, do we have a workaround to get that data to a platform that then is going to be connected?
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: Because we will have to go to those vendors using the card management as an example to say, can we push that to our core and get that in our course note module and then find a way to push that across the API for that connection?
Speaker 6: Okay, great. So those are kind of the three points that were in that document that I want to make sure we touch on even by email chain after the demo would be perfectly fine.
Agent: Okay. Awesome. I think we got some homework to do. So we'll have some internal syncs with [PERSON-24] as well just so everyone's up to speed and on the same page.
Agent: Then hopefully we'll get that all scuttled up and we can start the process for the next phase, folks.
Speaker 6: Great. Well, thanks. Thank you everyone for your time everybody can sneak out of the office early maybe.
Agent: On a [DATE-15]. Hopefully
Agent: [DATE-32].
Speaker 6: I'm gonna say, you've got a seasonably probably about 50 by the time [TIME-7] rolls around and I get out of my last meaning so
Agent: Good weather will be
Agent: I may be on the hiking
Agent: Track.
Agent: I love
Agent: The Star-Rock area. Is that
Speaker 6: Near you?
Speaker 6: Right?
Speaker 6: That is near me. I don't know if I'll go that far. I've got a nice nice lake made around a timber area that's all of [TIME-8] from the office there you go.
Agent: Parking lots.
Agent: Nice. Yeah,
Speaker 7: Awesome. Well, thank
Agent: You all again and we shall chat soon. Alright, have a great","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Based on the transcript, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product has the potential to meet their needs, but they have not yet seen a demo of the product. They expressed interest in scheduling a demo and involving various teams and stakeholders in the process. However, they did not explicitly state that the product meets their needs at this point.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and use case. However, they could have spent more time understanding the customer's current systems and processes for handling fraud detection and prevention. Specifically, the rep could have asked more questions about how the customer currently handles fraud detection and what specific pain points or challenges the customer is experiencing with their current system. This would have helped the rep better understand the customer's needs and position the seller's product as a solution to those specific pain points.

Additionally, the rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's marketing and segmentation strategies. While the rep did ask some questions about segmentation and marketing, they could have delved deeper into this topic to understand how the customer currently segments their members and what specific marketing campaigns they are running. This would have helped the rep better understand the customer's needs and position the seller's product as a solution for improving the customer's marketing efforts.

Finally, the rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current ticketing and servicing processes. While the rep did ask some questions about the customer's ticketing system and processes, they could have delved deeper into this topic to understand how the customer currently manages tickets and what specific challenges they are experiencing. This would have helped the rep better understand the customer's needs and position the seller's product as a solution for improving the customer's ticketing and servicing processes.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential for the seller's product to provide a unified, 360-degree view of their customers, which would help them break down silos and make data more actionable. They also mentioned the potential for the product to improve member touchpoints, provide a better customer experience, and deflect calls by giving members real-time updates on the status of their requests. The customer also appreciated the storytelling approach of the seller, which helped them envision the possibilities of the product.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information about any specific concerns the customer has that would prevent the deal from closing. There are mentions of various processes and systems, but no explicit expression of concerns or blockers to closing the deal.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked several open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""I would love to go through, I will walk through what I heard your deal cycle was. And I wanna make sure that I got all of that correct and I wanna make sure that I get all of the right systems that we're touching just to make sure that we know everything we need to be integrating with and what that full process looks like, which sounds like you're the perfect guy to talk to you for that.""

2. ""So from what I understand from our past conversation, they would basically fill out a form from [GPE-1], and that would be the application. It would then be sent into a pool of emails, and that would go to the member servicing slash customer service teams. Would that also go to the loan officers, and they would pick up? Depending on which it was. If it was just a new account, or if that was the primary starting point, then that would go to a team of our supervisors and more senior member service people.""

3. ""So If there's anything else you want to throw in there, otherwise [PERSON-6] is welcome to take it away. Awesome. Okay.""

4. ""The first thing that I wanted to make sure we had clarity on is the difference between your member servicing and then your customer servicing. Are those reps the same people or is it your member servicing team is new business, your customer service reps are recurring members? Like what is the difference there?""

5. ""So from here, I would love to go through, I will walk through what I heard your deal cycle was. And I wanna make sure that I got all of that correct and I wanna make sure that I get all of the right systems that we're touching just to make sure that we know everything we need to be integrating with and what that full process looks like, which sounds like you're the perfect guy to talk to you for that.""

6. ""And I wanna make sure that I get all of the right systems that we're touching just to make sure that we know everything we need to be integrating with and what that full process looks like, which sounds like you're the perfect guy to talk to you for that.""

7. ""So from what I understand from our past conversation, they would basically fill out a form from [GPE-1], and that would be the application.

8. ""And I wanna make sure that I get all of the right systems that we're touching just to make sure that we know everything we need to be integrating with and what that full process looks like, which sounds like you're the perfect guy to talk to you for that.""

These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs, pain points, and current processes, which is crucial for identifying customer intent.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So the first thing that I wanted to make sure we had clarity on is the difference between your member servicing and then your customer servicing. Are those reps the same people or is it your member servicing team is new business, your customer service reps are recurring members? Like what is the difference there?""

   The customer provided a detailed explanation of the difference between member servicing and customer servicing, indicating engagement and interest in the topic.

2. ""And what I've gathered so far in a high-level view is that improving both the internal and external processes to make for an overall better customer experience is like the main goal. And in turn leads to growth of the business overall. Is that accurate and on track?""

   The customer confirmed the sales rep's understanding, showing engagement and agreement with the proposed goal.

3. ""And then from there, I would love to go through, I will walk through what I heard your deal cycle was. And I wanna make sure that I got all of that correct and I wanna make sure that I get all of the right systems that we're touching just to make sure that we know everything we need to be integrating with and what that full process looks like, which sounds like you're the perfect guy to talk to you for that.""

   The customer actively engaged in discussing the deal cycle and provided detailed information about their current processes, indicating interest in the integration possibilities with the sales rep's product.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of the company's product throughout the call. They explained how the product could help the customer by providing a unified view of customer interactions, making data more actionable, and improving the overall member experience. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have further emphasized the value proposition. For example, when discussing the potential to deflect calls by providing members with real-time updates on the status of their requests, the sales rep could have highlighted how this would not only improve the member experience but also reduce the workload for the customer's call center team. Additionally, when discussing the potential to capture and organize data in a more effective way, the sales rep could have provided specific examples of how this would enable the customer to make more informed decisions and improve their marketing efforts. Overall, while the sales rep did a good job of explaining the value proposition, there were opportunities to further emphasize the benefits of the product in the context of the customer's specific needs and challenges.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the top concerns the customer had about the seller's product. The conversation revolves around understanding the customer's business processes, their current systems, and their pain points, rather than discussing specific concerns about the seller's product.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person if they were not present. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The seller mentions scheduling a demo and following up with the RFP document, but it is unclear if these steps were agreed upon by the customer.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They were open to scheduling a demo and discussed next steps for the deal. They also expressed interest in the seller's product and its capabilities. However, they mentioned that they would like to involve more stakeholders in the decision-making process and have further discussions on pricing before making a final decision. Overall, the customer seemed engaged and interested in moving forward with the deal."
video_19752_167_6qr3y000000g2FDAAY,"Agent: For the insurance billing, that the organization that's gonna help build that out is actually out of [GPE-1]. So that's obviously very early for them.
Agent: So they sent me a note saying that, they wouldn't be able to join, but I can give you a quick update on what the solution's gonna look like.
Agent: But industrious would be still leading the Implementation and they would just be supporting it with their solution. Perfect.
Agent: All right.
Agent: All right, well, appreciate the opportunity again, but I really appreciate the gift sales force. You know, we think this is a very strong use case for us.
Agent: And hopefully you find that through the demo as well in terms of fit and solution that we've come up with. But this is your session. So feel free to ask any questions. It's meant to be interactive.
Agent: You got to adjust to me through team last time. So skip introductions here. In terms of timeline, we're kind of at that demo phase. The next step would be technical scoping.
Agent: So if you like what you see [DATE-1], basically with some [PERSON-1]'s online, [PERSON-1] with [PERSON-2], just scoping this out in terms of what you see so that they can build more customized statement of work in terms of delivery of the [ORG-1] product and the solution based on your use case.
Agent: So they'll customize it. exactly find out what you're going to see [DATE-1] . And then that will allow us to then put together the statement of work and the pricing and then present that back to you.
Agent: At some point, probably sometime [DATE-2] and then we can probably get to if everything looks good, we can probably get to contracting potentially by [DATE-3].
Agent: But the goal here is to try to get something done before [DATE-4]. We sail for systems clearing.
Agent: So there's going to be some sort of incentive to help incentivize you to get that done before [DATE-4].
EndUser: Perfect. Anything let's choose with...
Agent: Change on your own?
Agent: Like any... Nope, Okay. All right.
Agent: So last time we did that discovery session, you know, whiteboarding, lots of notes, learned a lot about your business, a lot of potential there in terms of what is possible, where we think, where we can help.
Agent: So kind of just to recap a little bit about what we heard, just providing you a centralized source of truth, centralized data. You don't have that [DATE-1].
Agent: Obviously being paper-based causes issues in terms of like risk of floods, no analytics, no opportunity to actually retarget as well. There's no automation [DATE-1], so really there's no workplace for your paper place, paper-based.
Agent: When it comes to engagement, no real patient automation, and really focusing on that organic growth, one thing we notice is you are spending quite a bit on ads as an example.
Agent: There's probably an opportunity there as you build up your databases, people get interested, and you can start to remarket the number. Then also getting you ready for AI as well.
Agent: Visibility, again, being paper-based, there's no real dashboards or metrics or performance [DATE-1]. Outside, probably maybe what you're getting from [ORG-2] and maybe some of your added stuff.
Agent: And then no single record of the patient beyond kind of what you had from a paper-based model.
Agent: And then ultimately getting to a single source of truth from a patient record, so clinical notes, billing history, insurance, all that being in one place.
Agent: And then scalability, really just helping you grow from that, you know, growth of doing [DATE-5], the [DATE-6]. Really, a system like this will help you get there.
Agent: And that desire for an app in the future, supporting some sort of value added activities, engagement, education for your patients. Prospects as well.
Agent: That's really important because I know that this could be theoretically longer cycle sale, potentially right where it's like, you know, there's interest would be three [DATE-7] before they actually go forward with moving forward.
Agent: So, Anything else that you'd want to add?
Agent: Or anything else, [PERSON-3]?
Agent: Ok. OK, go ahead. So in terms of how [ORG-3] helps, in terms of that problem, that silo data, no visibility, manual processes across your patient journey, is really bringing in that centralizing engagement platform.
Agent: So you'll see during the demo, [ORG-4], and all that comes together. And then really just servicing more patients at scale. So I know you're fairly small in terms of like resources.
Agent: So it's all about automation, right?
Agent: There's much automation without sacrificing patient experience. So patient on more and more. And then potential referral management as well could be huge for you. And then those post-op care plans.
Agent: So really that's the automation and personalization that comes in. And then limited insights into performance. We didn't see any of the search team reports.
Agent: I'm not sure what that looks like, but it's really just optimization of that Marketing spend because that is fairly large from a [DATE-8] standpoint. We think that there's probably some opportunity there to help you from a Marketing standpoint.
Agent: And then ultimately future proofing integrations with other applications that you think you might like send to [ORG-5] as an example, other platforms that you may need, and then the scalability of the platform. So that's really the platform expansion.
Agent: Just [ORG-1], we can talk about the customer through the patient through 403 and all the different offerings that [ORG-1] has for our product standpoint.
Agent: And business case really simple here, it's like we get you 53 additional patients per month, that potentially means 58 million. I'm assuming you know that all the So there's a pretty good strong business case there too .
Agent: So we spoke a little bit about the patient 363.
Agent: So [DATE-1] you'll see a little bit more on Health Cloud, but the whole idea here is as you expand your grow, if you think about your app as well, that can all be done on the platform.
Agent: So when it comes to providers, you know, we gave the example of [PRODUCT-1] and mimic health last time.
Agent: But the whole idea here is that our platform health cloud is specifically built for providers and that's kind of what we're going to be showcasing.
Agent: So really it's to help you collaborate with your care teams, curate those real-time experiences and nurture those patient relationships, whether they're an actual converted patient or whether they're just getting educated to become potentially patient and then connect those processes with the automation.
Agent: To ultimately eliminate costs and repetitive tasks for your staff . So your patient care coordinator team is an example, just trying to automate as much as possible.
Agent: Compliance, HIPAA compliant, all the meets all the regulatory stuff, just want to put that in there just so you know and kind of peace of mind in terms of that.
Agent: So we're not going to be demoing these [DATE-1], but I wanted to make sure that you knew that this will be part of the solution and we've got already pricing for the [ORG-6] billing module.
Agent: And then on the studio, we'll talk, let me just talk about the billing piece first. So there's a billing basically platform that will do all your claim. Basically, the insurance verification, the claims, send all that automatically through [ORG-1].
Agent: It's built on platform. So it's provided by a company called [ORG-7]. So they're an app exchange solution. So they're going to be working with [ORG-8] in the background to build that new.
Agent: So that'll be part of your statement of work. You'll see there is a subscription associated to this as well, just so you know, that'll be included in the pricing.
Agent: So this is that idea of, you know, your physicians want to make these markings and have like this cool app. It's possible.
Agent: But is it worth it?
Agent: That's what I'm gonna leave it at. Like it is possible and I'll give you a price for it. We can scope it out with the industry's team in terms of pricing. There may be other solutions out there.
Agent: I just, we don't have enough time to research those, but there could be, if you've seen something else, but my thought was that you have a lot of optionality there where I'm sure you could do it on platform.
Agent: There's gonna be a cost associated to it. And if you're okay with that, sure, you could do it on platform. Otherwise we could look at other options out there that we can just integrate that may be potentially cheaper.
EndUser: Or is there a different Workflow where it's just... like uploading a picture and you have like a paper type chart that just gets associate d back So the main thing is the paper, they have to color it in, and it's really annoying.
Agent: To the patient part .
EndUser: So to be able to click on a muscle group and it changes color.
Agent: So literally she'll make little dots and then to the one of the clinic assistants who will then use a marker and color it in. So just really getting it's a cumbersome process. So enough.
EndUser: Yeah, fair
Agent: If there's enough value there, give you a price for it. So, but I just want to, you know, I mean, you need to make that decision, but it's possible.
Agent: That's what I'm saying.
Agent: All right, so [PERSON-4], do you want to just quickly go over a more good one?
Agent: So Marketing Cloud is what you're going to see [PERSON-5] demonstrate to you [DATE-1]. So that's going to be focusing on the patient communication.
Agent: So nurturing those potential patients to get them to a point where they book a consult or a surgery with the team. This is also going to focus on optimizing your digital ad spend.
Agent: I think last time we spoke, you mentioned you had, you know, a lot of leads coming in, but not the most qualified. So we're going to look to see where the ad spend your allocation.
Agent: Getting dollars to are yielding the best results and help yo u reallocate that based on where you're seeing the most qualifie d leads coming from . that's what we're going to focus on during our demonstratio n [DATE-1] .
Agent: Right. And we'll talk a little bit about business case, but I'll leave these behind and we'll send these to you. So, but, you know, there's significant potential ROI here from a Marketing and optimization as well.
Agent: And we survey customers all the time.
Agent: So based on some of our latest results, you know, customers that have chosen [ORG-1], they've seen [PERCENT-1] increase in ROI, increase in service called deflection, decrease in operation costs, increase in sales, overall ROI and Marketing as well.
Agent: Again, like similar to slide before, but just really supporting patient acquisition, efficiency, patient care plans,
Agent: We spoke about a couple of examples, but in terms of some of the logos we work with that are public, these are some potential good examples.
Agent: I think the closest one was [ORG-9] that we said, which is basically a surgical center out of the [LOC-1] [GPE-2]. We work with a lot of what we call ambulatory surgical centers.
Agent: Maybe you've heard of those in the [GPE-3], but there's a lot of those that's leverage sales versus well, very similar to your use case.
Agent: This was just me doing some math here for you, but I'm sure you can do this in your mind too, in terms of what you're expecting from a business case of how you're gonna position this internally with your team and the founders and kind of the owners as well.
Agent: I don't know, if we're able to do 62 patients unilaterally, that's potentially 15 million a year, in terms of revenue. The thing I would look at too is like, the total addressable market.
Agent: So I did some research in terms of frozen shoulder. So it affects under the adult population, 367 million in the [GPE-2], [PERCENT-2] of the population, and actually suffer from it.
Agent: So that gives you a pretty large addressable market, right, between 6.8 to 15.4 million patients, potentially. So getting [DATE-9] is very realistic out of that, in cool locations [DATE-10] was being conservative, including [GPE-4].
EndUser: That's available. Yeah, that's why I said But.
Agent: Yeah, I'm just thinking about the states now because for sure.
EndUser: For sure. [GPE-3] is going to be kind of
Agent: The big one for you as you kind of introduce insurance as well. Absolutely. Yeah.
Agent: Awesome. All right, I'll stop there and I think [PERSON-5]'s going to take over. Sounds good. I'm going to go up cameras just for bandwidth and I'm going to share my screen. All right. All right.
Agent: Looks like we are going to go. Okay, so I'm going to quickly walk through how this could help you speed up the conversion process.
Agent: And if I'm a customer and I have a frozen shoulder and if you're curious about this right many people would start here and [ORG-10] for their journey and they might start with this type of search term right so the good news right you happen to be at the top of the page.
Agent: For an organic search rate, which is a high intense search rate. So those folks that are seeking us out tends to be more interested in qualified versus what you might get with that.
Agent: But the good news is whether or not, It's an ad and something sponsored. You're going to be able to put customers through a journey that would help me qualify them automatically.
Agent: So where this goes from here, I see this is the [DATE-15] website I're cutting a phone back where you filled out a form.
Agent: I did actually fill it out and it was interesting and helpful to see the [PRODUCT-2] that I got and new team reached out via SMS, which is my preference.
Agent: So I think it's great, you're capturing email and SMS together. This is an advantage for you.
Agent: And especially when you go to [ORG-15] too because what this does is it's giving the [PERSON-6] y to connect with folks on the channel of their choice, right Like honestly, emails, I really, I'm very rarely I'm trying to open them, but in essence I never miss it It's actually in my voicemail of case texting if you want me to know something we'll call you back because my voicemai l is often frankly full, due to row up out So what I'd like about this a lot for you to do is thi s is going to make it easier for yo u to connect with those customers .
Agent: As you get to the [GPE-2] right in, as you're growing in [GPE-4] and really anywhere sales for supports compliance and support consent.
Agent: And so what you get is A consenting percent you can connect with on multiple channels on a single contact. So where we're going to go next, right, is I filled out this form.
Agent: And what's going to happen right is just Marketing Cloud and a couple quick things here. Marketing cloud is going to catch that. And we're going to put me on a journey. Couple things just really quickly.
Agent: Right, we offer email, you can do SMS and push messages. We can connect with folks on advertising, we can let you build forms.
Agent: We often native reporting journey builders connected to all of this, this is how you use those multiple channels.
Agent: You have a really easy way to store your content, so you can use those templates over and over, and also search platforms and include native [PRODUCT-3] capability.
Agent: So we still help you do things like make sure you send your email by the time that individuals most likely to open them if you want to experiment with that.
Agent: And really, you know, bread and butter here is male and SMS, so they get their using to compose, you know, attractive and professional, you know.
Agent: So, but back to the patient journey, right?
Agent: So, here we are, we're doing the builders, you know, within the platform.
Agent: And what has happened here, right?
Agent: First up, what we see is this is, receiving that inbound format and now request in that message. So what this is doing right is right away in the old town.
Agent: And it's saying, OK, [PERSON-5], we're going to connect with you right away. We're going to let you know a little bit more about frozen shoulder.
Agent: And we're able to, as a user, use a drag and drop canvas to do this. So I had another journey that is a little more built out. That was where the one that was just written email.
Agent: And so if we kind of think about this and add a little bit more to this, and add a channel, this becomes that much more powerful. So I fill out the form we get that.
Agent: Marketing Cloud has ingested my information and [ORG-15] is not going to support you right away or you're sending me a relevant, helpful email to me to begin with this journey.
Agent: And of course, right away, what you might do first, depending on your workloads, you might reach out and call them, but what's great is, you know, let's say you missed the person, let's say they can pick up, this gives you a really good key to vehicle to stay in connection with them.
Agent: And you know, at that moment, when maybe they're trying to figure this out, you know, this isn't the time to do something like say, hey, you know, like a sweat, [PERCENT-3] of success rate, you know, say things, you know, explain things like, did you know frozen shoulder 106, right?
Agent: And this is, this is just prompt and helpful information that's irrelevant to whether and maybe they know all of that's very but what we can do right is make it really easy .
Agent: To book an appointment, it will make it really easy to customize this content. We can do things like save images in Content blocks that are here. In fact, what I mean is it can really easily just...
Agent: I drag that image over and if I wanted to add [PRODUCT-2] about overview blog, right?
Agent: Or maybe we would want to say something like, hey, you know, check out what our customers have to say. So I just wanted to really quickly cruise through email and how that works and what it looks like.
Agent: And then again, just get to kind of this first bit of, you know, we have brought the same visual in, right?
Agent: We can give them a call. Depending on what we might know about them, we can
Agent: Go from there to send them as soon as to Send me an email to the equipment. I think I just saw a hand raise [PERSON-4] with the top please pop in. Thanks, [PERSON-7].
Agent: I just wanted to pause here really quick as I get your feedback on what you're seeing so far.
Agent: So again, to kind of summarize, this would be the nurturing series for when someone's coming in initially and they either get a text or an email and trying to convert them over to that initial consultation.
Agent: And then you can also have journeys to get them to that surgery piece as well. And also alumni relations. So if you want them to be advocates and endorsing, you know, what [PERSON-8] does, which I think
EndUser: You mentioned , something that you really want to push fo r as a way to find new patients . can build up these journeys . here's on your feedback here and what you think .
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, we have something similar with the active campaign. I'm not sure if it's as robust of an option, but ultimately
Agent: Something along
Agent: The same framework. I like that
EndUser: You guys incorporate SMS embarrassingly enough. That's a live person Messaging you. I received it. I did.
EndUser: That's the asthma my patient coordinator so she'll do a walk you get your email automation then she'll do some follow up text messages and phone calls to try to engage and then you'll get you'll continue with the email automation and show email as well.
EndUser: They tried to arrange a phone call. So
Agent: Yeah
Agent: Automating that process is would be great. And it looks like you guys incorporate the SMS along with the email within the journey. Correct.
Agent: Exactly, and that way to eliminate that manual task that the care coordinator is doing now [DATE-1]. And also you can do push notifications. So we talked about an app.
Agent: So if you wanted to do an app, like that's another channel that you could use.
Agent: For part of the journey and Again, the idea is eliminating the manual task being able to have all that information one place because it has the bidirectional [ORG-15] with [ORG-1] when you're looking at [ORG-1].
Agent: I can see this person already got this text message this email I don't need to send them again because we want to make sure that they know that
Agent: You know We know who they are.
Agent: We're not just inundating them with the relevant information Well, and you know [PERSON-4], the build on that and you know the concept of an app because what I noticed is I just learned a little bit about frozen shoulder.
Agent: So there's a ton of information out there and it's, you know, a pretty serious condition and we need to explain about the need for educational content.
Agent: Another thing here is that if you have folks that are active in your app and they use it right what you do get is actually it's a cheaper channel to communicate with them on.
Agent: And if you can just pull some in the app and say, appointment now. There's a reminder . or prompt them for information. It's a good way to combine that too.
Agent: And what you can think about as well, if you do an app with me sending an SMS where you could actually include the link to your app and say, hey, welcome down on the app.
Agent: And you can go through it, right?
Agent: Or something more like calls back. But you can just include that link. And then from there, what's great is they're engaged on another channel. which always makes it more likely that they'll convert.
Agent: And these messages are dynamic, they're pretty simple for build. It's not very hard to set up the messages themselves.
Agent: And this often it's also not very difficult to customize them and to make them experience exactly what you will kind of expect in terms of what this video plays. I'm just going to quickly grab the area there.
Agent: I'm not even scared.
Agent: We could go look at this. It looks like there's a tablet device. Right, and this is kind of like what you're used to in a, you know, retail experience, where maybe you, you know, open up your dorms often.
Agent: They're highlighting a special sale of perhaps a brand you like. And all this is really doing the same.
Agent: Well, when this person opens the app or do you want to just surface this information to them?
Agent: And then you get simple templates to set the stuff up, you know, code. So another fan of that use case of, you know, getting the SMS that says, you know, get my app and then.
Agent: Being able to get communications from apps. So cruising forward from that, the SMS is big. The app stuff is really helpful. Customers really like that. And from there, you see this bit here, where this is the question mark.
Agent: So what this is doing in this offer is this is actually going to go kind of down into full controls here. You know, this is where you can set up based on the data about the person.
Agent: [ORG-1] will be able to watch and you'll see some of the things that are sort of down the whole did the appointment get booked or not.
Agent: And so if the answer is yes, and they booked, then you can send them a reminder.
Agent: And a task to reach out to that person and to confirm them, right?
Agent: Or source them, and you know, or what have you a push message.
Agent: And so that's the ideal scenario, right?
Agent: That's where people go. But, you know, let's say for those folks that, you know, maybe they just weren't as qualified to come in on where they came in from or they're just not ready.
Agent: And it's long term that you can also do here in the jargon drop-on move journey, as you can connect with them on another channel.
Agent: We still put a multitude of destinations and what you can do here is I have a fake account so I won't put my credit card in there for them.
Agent: What you can do here is you can then match what we're seeing as carrying on with me to [ORG-15] and I can then match on these people and say, you know, let's their email address.
Agent: I mean, we want to match as well, you know, phone number, So here's that. Right. And this is going to get me a strong match because then I can say, you know, find [PERSON-5].
Agent: If you can't find your email address, my phone number, and you'll get some [PRODUCT-2] in front of you know, for their helper. I'll be educated about what person's shoulder has to offer.
Agent: So this is something that's really powerful person. We get really good results from this because, you know, what this is doing as a person. Clearly has some intent right there.
Agent: Clearly interested in a solution, but for whatever reason, you know, maybe [DATE-15] just wasn't the time to get in touch or maybe something else went on.
Agent: It's a really useful way to do that and make customer to sum I just wanted to say,
EndUser: Service a really good result. So up the journey screen here and wow, that is cool.
Agent: I didn't know you could do that. Yeah, well, good. That is super cool. Okay. to know as well like this makes your digital strategy a lot more powerful because it's taking your first party data.
Agent: So, you know, potential patients that you know have intent and using that within your ad spend versus just like constantly looking at the top of the funnel, it's reengaging
EndUser: The people who have shown initial interest and trying to bring them back into that funnel.
Agent: Brilliant.
Agent: And oh, and also really great is we don't have to do any sort of spreadsheet uploading and it's a secure connection that It's shared with patients either say Let's say I had a goal center, but again last but not least here.
Agent: So, you know one glad you love it Two it's really good coverage for multi-channel.
Agent: This is a really helpful way to keep people interested You know three just want to highlight You can use information about the person and maybe what they say about themselves to different communication based on what they share, maybe it' s life cycle stage, maybe it's how they talk about the severity You can act into things like do they talk to you or not, do they think that but .
Agent: And onboard them into other channels and kind of reconnect it if that doesn't work.
Agent: And so really powerful stuff and you measure this based on the actual outcome, right?
Agent: So it's greatly used then this and we have these wonderful communications, but the entire point of this is to help these individuals come in for surgery and help these individuals move through this campaign.
Agent: And so the best way to measure it and what's the support that's really great is you can say, you know, I want [PERCENT-4] of these people to do the endpoint and the intake, and you can pick that exactly you want them to do.
Agent: You can measure this whole journey based on how these people flow through this, whether it worked or not based on that.
Agent: So it's a powerful concept just because It takes your Marketing and makes it very applied to operations and patient needs. It's concrete. It's very concrete.
Agent: A couple of things quickly here, in [PRODUCT-2] builders, as part of Marketing cloud, this is a very constrained, very cost-trial content. I have all kinds of stuff in my new components.
Agent: These folders are probably like... You can create lots of types of content. We have email templates. They're pre-created, they're mobile responsive. I want to say there's 10 out of the box.
Agent: You see a great deal of music out of the box. Customized content.
Agent: It's like a [ORG-10] map, right?
Agent: Where is it?
Agent: How close is it?
Agent: That sort of thing will be put forward. We can do things like social follow, social share. You can actually ask people to put forms through in your email. So it's really great in terms of flexibility.
Agent: And then, yeah, so this is my list where you can store it. You can read it. You can just duplicate emails that you like and edit them and kind of move those blocks down.
Agent: This is where advertising audiences is. So in a new use case of, of course, we're engaging those folks that didn't book yet. This is super powerful. And I would say that's probably.
Agent: Generally speaking, when I've seen folks do that, it's low-healing fruit and it's [TIME-1] of water and it's powerful. But those aren't the only folks, so you might want to be doing some acquisition as well.
Agent: And what you can do there is that same process of you're able to connect with sport [ORG-15] [PRODUCT-4], Pinterest, [PERSON-9], people, [ORG-15], and yeah.
Agent: And then we also, if you are going to do ads on [ORG-15], you can end up as well. So this is how you could do that and you can transmit those audiences over in that secure way.
Agent: And then just some of the highlights . channel flexibility for how you can activate that. And we get this holistic recruiting journey that lets you, you know, one, go do your look-alike for your best customers.
Agent: And say, I'm going to take, I'm not sure why this is saying the name a little bit, but you know, everybody who, you know, converted on a surgery, go talk [ORG-15] and [ORG-10], you know, use your algorithms, take this data that I'm providing for your algorithm to figure out, and go find more people to look.
Agent: Like those top customers, so many problems of job here.
Agent: And so what the like is really powerful for encoding top of model conversion?
Agent: Is this right?
Agent: And so here you are, you get that same mapping and this is something where you can use this right Code of WLX. So, of course, this is provided by users.
Agent: And then when you, you know, get to the [ORG-13] part of the [ORG-15], you can take top customers. You can say optimize for reach or you can optimize for similarities.
Agent: So, you can say, I want to get as many people I want to go by, or I want to get people that are very, very similar. And of course you can. country here, get notification and those things happen.
Agent: You don't like to learn about updating spreadsheets. You don't have to load spreadsheet communities, people that need them helpful.
Agent: So yeah, so that's how all the channels fit together, right?
Agent: Of email, mobile, how you can get [ORG-21], push Messaging very straightforward to do that and get that stuff set up, you know, the ability to fill up forms anywhere.
Agent: We can as well and take into account and directly bring it into [ORG-19] and it just likes to talk for supported.
Agent: And then yeah, so those are kind of the big things I wanted to hit and then last but not least, also really important is out of the box, straightforward tools to combine and blend and bring in the spend that even kind of writes.
Agent: I know that, because I've done some work with [ORG-15], we've done some work with [ORG-10], and we've used this channel as for acquisition.
Agent: And so the fact of the matter about the data that comes from [ORG-10] and the data that comes from [ORG-15], [ORG-15] specifically had [DATE-15] to rows of KPI indicators that their ad engine kicks out is to solve many details of how you can look at performance.
Agent: And it's a massive amount of [ORG-15]-that is kind of gnarly. And so same story right for... Google Ads is it's not that those data almost as two streams are not fun.
Agent: And so where market is often good stuff, when you try to say, hey, gosh, how do I look at what's contributing to my revenue?
Agent: My Facebook and my [ORG-10] are my YouTube. Because after the fact, they're converting on the website or not, they are filling out the form or not. They are clipping through or not.
Agent: They are emailing and they're typing on or not. So, you know, what really happens. And so what data on the does, like [ORG-23], climate projects does, is it's out of the box.
Agent: Connectors or you know, put click connect, click connect. We did a model automatically fluency. The same story for [DATE-15] and [DATE-15]. Click click connect. And then you have these templates that are surfacing.
Agent: From that data that is pre-connected information that combines this that you can see clearly, you know, what happened. So let's say it was in the 3.1s span, I think it was 0.4117343675585136, and span were up [PERCENT-5].
Agent: Here we are in revenue from that span, realistically, what is it looking like for the recorder?
Agent: You can do [DATE-15], and you can of course locate in your top line performance you have spent, and you have nothing you can look at in a cost per acquisition.
Agent: And some of this, you know, is this is really great, right?
Agent: But, you know, what we really want to know here is, you know, brass sacks with marketers.
Agent: And so, any, what you can do here is you select your campaign, and you can go ahead and pick that, right?
Agent: We'll know what it is. If you select your agent, you could select your service on your interface. It's, you know, it's going to be frozen shoulder. This is something like, you know, trigonics or, you know, frozen shoulder patients.
Agent: You can divide your data up that way. And then you have your funnel breakdown by channel. So how are... emails working.
Agent: How is Facebook working?
Agent: How is they social working?
Agent: In other words, in this case, this is looking at all the data. It's telling you reach distribution. It's telling you whatever your caption is for your web traffic.
Agent: And what's really getting you the most bang, period, buck, right?
Agent: You can see here, pay search $[MONEY-1], cost for conversion.
Agent: And you know what?
Agent: [ORG-15] is up at $[MONEY-2], right?
Agent: So bad, but there's certainly not as well done as a pay search in terms of efficiency.
Agent: That's not
Agent: We've got to hand [PERSON-4]. Yeah, thanks, [PERSON-10]. How are you doing your reporting [DATE-1]
EndUser: From that ad spend?
EndUser: Like, how are you seeing that 10,000, whatever you're spending [DATE-13] on social, how that's converting over?
EndUser: It's specific to the platform. So [ORG-2] with our PPC for [ORG-10] and [PERSON-15], it's all separate.
Agent: And then we kind of, you know, we're put that on [PRODUCT-5] files.
Agent: Information together
Agent: Got it. It's manually it together from the different platforms it with
EndUser: Piecing and then you're cross-referencing who's converted.
Agent: How much time does that take?
Agent: What did you say?
Agent: This is better for sure.
Agent: Well, so one great thing about this that customers really like is this is they see this as a shared ledger with the agency and with [ORG-15] and the [ORG-10] and in other ways to hold all of that accountable without having to ask them what is the performance.
Agent: If I'm looking at the performance, what do we want to change versus, you know, the you know, sort of back and forth and [DATE-15] reports.
Agent: It's, you always have this and then this is, it's a straightforward way to have that conversation.
Agent: Well, again, you know, having this all in real-time and you know, this is your data, right?
Agent: Say that data that you have coming out of [ORG-15], that's done that you have, same sort of [ORG-10], right?
Agent: And all of these individuals, all these people that are, you know, booking and coming in and doing the commitments and intakes and things like any new series. That all belongs to you.
Agent: And that data, you can just have this at your fingertips. And then in that panel, I guess, goes over time. And it's really quick to set up. It's like maybe [TIME-2].
Agent: It's not a big gigantic, oh, it's not to take further to projects. It's just not.
Agent: But to kind of leave you with this, when you think of all optimizing spend, A lot of it is about having ownership of the data in a way that you can get added.
Agent: And then because the state of [ORG-17], you can hold the agency accountable to the performance. And more, I think efficient, effective way.
Agent: And it's actually really pretty common that customers use data on this, specifically to have a shared dashboard that is the kind of base of measurement for the relationship with the agency and in value with this time. So.
Agent: I'll kind of leave you pause in other
Agent: With that and
EndUser: Questions or at least show what insights you might want to add.
Agent: No, nothing for me. Okay.
EndUser: No, looks into this centralized hub here.
Agent: Great. Really excited to have everything integrated [GPE-5].
EndUser: Yeah, it's really satisfying. when you go through it. It's so satisfying. The thing that I wonder, because [ORG-23], they kind of keep you, only
Agent: They don't give you access to the [ORG-10] ads manager. That's the only thing I'm not sure how that's
Agent: Going to be integrated, but we should find a way. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you for your feedback. And [PERSON-2], I'm going to pass it over to you. Thank you.
Agent: Okay, so I'll spend [TIME-3] if I ask, just walking through two pieces of what it looks like for, okay, given that new referral or interested patient to raise their hand, and what that looks like as an intake or just managing say that lead.
Agent: Some of the tools that we could leverage just to understand the initial assessment and then insurance activity that we might have against that given a patient or that given lead, then moving into a quick.
Agent: What a patient profile could represent, and then touching on a few general tools that the team could use a chart, schedule an appointment, so on and so forth. So that's what we'll cover [DATE-1].
Agent: I'll keep it pretty tight and give some good time towards the end for discussion and for you to get to your maybe next call if they accept it and then not decline it.
Agent: But I'll put myself in the shoes of a say that intake specialist or just someone managing any say referrals coming from the community or Individuals raising their hand online as [PERSON-5] walked us through This could represent like what a customized homepage could look like for a given individual like that where you'll see some Reporting out of the gate with regards to Maybe understanding just a referrals by source So like maybe what channels or maybe what locations?
Agent: Amongst our partners and makings referrals I know [PERSON-5] touched on some of the Marketing side, and I'll I will touch on where that comes into play.
Agent: To a trend reports, like what does the referrals look like at maybe different locations and what's the type of these referrals that we are receiving from our community partners.
Agent: So we'll get a little bit more into this towards the end. But same thing goes similar to Marketing where we could report on just the activity from the operational side when we look towards the [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: I'm going to pick on [PERSON-15] here.
Agent: So as individuals either get referred into our organization or we take the example that obviously [PERSON-5] walked us through where they might come across and add on [ORG-10], [ORG-15], whatever it may be, when they input their information within that form, that can then dynamically create the record that we're seeing here.
Agent: So we'll take all that great information from your Marketing side and then create the... lead record, if you will, within the [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: And with that, we can curate or understand that maybe the steps that we usually take to convert a given patient, you outline that beautifully in our discovery call, but just generic steps as an example [DATE-1], we might have a good net new like lead coming in.
Agent: The second we have maybe a bit of activity against this given lead, we'll move that into working, and then hopefully we move it to qualify to convert it.
Agent: And get [PERSON-15] in here for a given surgery or procedure within our clinic.
Agent: All along the way, so we can map obviously some of those high-level contact details from the form, but we have obviously the option to create a richer lead record or profile overall as we get to know [PERSON-15].
Agent: So, [PERSON-15] called out the referral management channel.
Agent: I'll touch on that quickly here where If Trails did come, say, from a given referral partner within the community, we can make those a key relationships within the [PRODUCT-6] to understand that this might have came from, say, some [ORG-31] clinic, and then the actual referring practitioner was [PERSON-15].
Agent: I won't dive into these records, but we can have a rich profile against both, say, the clinic, as well as [PERSON-15], to understand, again, just the referrals that we are receiving from that entity.
Agent: Do they make sense?
Agent: Was the conversion look like very similar to the Marketing side?
Agent: And then do we have an approach maybe from a sales, like this is development point of view, to have Marketing maybe sent their way on like new service lines or just like what's an ideal referral or success cases that we might have experienced or that we will experience rather from the patients that they send along.
Agent: So another entire channel that we can actually leverage is a key stakeholder within the community.
Agent: A few other pieces.
Agent: The insurance will simulate, but the second we obviously understand the insurance associated with [PERSON-15], and we can understand like once we have our [ORG-26], we understand like the codes that we're obviously servicing, we can speak in the [GPE-2] to a clearing house that will show us and understand like what that copay might be.
Agent: So like what the coverage will obviously cover, and then what might be at a pocket safe for [PERSON-15] in that case. But so very key data points to begin to populate as we have maybe a conversation with [PERSON-15].
Agent: I just to understand the coverage realm that he has. I was just going to interrupt there.
Agent: [PERSON-13], did you get a chance to watch that pre-recorded demo at all?
Agent: If not, that's okay. But when you get a pretty in-depth in terms of how that claim, that clearing house, that all works within the system.
EndUser: Chance, that goes
Agent: It's [TIME-4], but people kind of explain it really well. Because a chance to watch it and actually get to interact
Agent: Me and [PERSON-2] got
EndUser: With the team that puts that together. So pretty robust in terms of the Integration there. I would certainly well,
Agent: I appreciate it. We have [DATE-21] coming in [DATE-2]. I'm going to be in the OR.
Agent: So just a lot of prep work in final kind of piece of noise. Rest assured it's there. So yeah.
Agent: Well, you will see, but this will simulate some of that functionality that they've definitely developed that this is just checking obviously the coverage for [PERSON-15], but we could just simply take who was insurance provider is within the [GPE-2] so maybe [PERSON-15] and then just a member ID, obviously that he has with them, and then we could check the eligibility and this is again a simulation but what we can understand that he does say have coverage.
Agent: There might be deductible of a say $[MONEY-3] and a remaining co-pay of [MONEY-4]3,000, because the coverage might be say upwards to say $[MONEY-5] or $[MONEY-6] if it's given procedure. So this is what it could look like.
Agent: Like once you see that recording, it'll have a similar look and feel of just like pinging that clearinghouse to have it up from conversation just like what the financials look like before actually moving into the procedure within the clinic.
Agent: With tight Integration that we can absolutely accommodate. Another piece that we do that you mentioned on the intake is just running in assessment.
Agent: So to the bales earlier point of what we dov [ORG-31], so that was an acquisition that we roll up in our industry solution as a standard functionality.
Agent: But with that, like, we showed the charting with progressive selecting like this area, and then maybe having some information populate or to have inputs there for charting. So we can use that same technology for charting.
Agent: You'll see in a moment, but also at the upfront assessment realm.
Agent: So this might be just a generic one, not nothing tailored, but we can embed that within the referral or the lead record and then walk through maybe a series of questions with regards to what they might be experiencing with their frozen shoulders.
Agent: This is a diabetes one, so just ignore that. But we can have some conditional logic as well if we do select a particular, value within our initial assessment that might present another question that we might want to accommodate.
Agent: Understanding that they have been hospitalized for the frozen-sulled shoulder, then have they been diagnosed with maybe other similar conditions that might be in the realm of frozen soldier just to give some context.
Agent: Whatever we do from the front end in terms of assessments, we can absolutely accommodate using our standard tooling to create a really rich experience for our intake specialist.
Agent: Just to walk through whatever that assessment is to complete it . and then move that great, say information on into his patient record for providers to ultimately see. But I won't, yeah, I played it.
EndUser: I won't obviously go through my time. Save some time. Quick question. So currently we have an intake form that's fired off by email and it kind of links to our website.
EndUser: They fill it out and then that gets sent to us via email. You're saying this would be integrated into the [ORG-1] platform. And then the agent or in our case care coordinator would be kind of filling everything out.
EndUser: Would there be to allow the patient to fill it in.
Agent: Sometimes they don't have
EndUser: The availability on the line to do it with the Care for us, is there a possibility to kind of?
Agent: Send something off to them and meanwhile it's still integrated within the system. Yeah, yeah, absolutely Yeah, if you're driving them to your website to complete that that initial assessment We could similar to like the Marketing side.
Agent: Well, we could bring that data in and then if there is Maybe some other fields to complete internally and just to pick up where they left off We could use a framework like this that, like that'll be, the data be submitted within the [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: And then we're just going to have an auto populate essentially this assessment overall. And then maybe we're just tweaking
Agent: Here and there after the patient's already self-served. So absolutely, short answer. I'm going to accommodate that. Yeah.
Agent: I do this with another clinic and exactly you're seeing use cases you an intake form on their website and that basically maps
EndUser: Where they have like
Agent: Back into fields within [ORG-1]. And then to the patient records, so it's all automated.
Agent: Absolutely. OK. A few other things to call out just before moving into scheduling and just speaking to that functionality, just the patient profile on the high level.
Agent: But we'll have, like, tamales are the point, like, when [PERSON-15] comes through a given channel and, like, how we have all that great reporting from her perspective is that we'll dynamically, obviously, roll late [PERSON-15] if he did come across, like, a [ORG-10] ad and actioned on that to that campaign record.
Agent: So from the intake specialist point of view, can we establish that key relationship where we can generate those insights and understand the efficiency that that's been?
Agent: But we might want to have some context with regards to the campaign or [PRODUCT-2] that they might have seen. So we get with that lock, like front center on the [PRODUCT-6] side as well.
Agent: And then the last piece here in terms of gathering or just captioning activity that we might have as like a business development or just outbound reach, we could record obviously some of this activity.
Agent: We could get really sophisticated and have integrated telephony, almost like a call center to have that outbound call where we chat with [PERSON-15].
Agent: We could document the notes that we might have against that conversation and go ahead and save it.
Agent: Worst case scenario, we just pick up the phone as we normally do and then we get action on just capturing that call activity, if you will.
Agent: Just for the team to have that line of sight into maybe some of those conversations that have taken place with [PERSON-15] in the past. Same thing goes for email.
Agent: So we can have an Integration to email where I can work out a Gmail Outlook and then have an Integration to Salesforce on the right hand side.
Agent: So it can like bring forward our [ORG-1] data, allow me to log emails against his given account, whichever record that might be, and then we'll have like a rich feed if you will of just all those different touch points.
Agent: That we might have had with [PERSON-15] because this might be obviously a [DATE-19] cycle to try to convert [PERSON-15] into having a procedure with us.
Agent: Yeah, one thing that folks really love about the inclusion of inbound emails from Outlook and from [ORG-31] or what happened to this is that it's A, it's really simple to set up and then B, no matter what somebody emails you, It's going to be automatically associated to this type of record that person's showing.
Agent: You'll have the body content. You can respond in your email as you normally would with an email and it will still be connected and logged.
Agent: So that's the end you can add tasks or you can say, oh, gosh, patient coordinator, FYI, you didn't know.
EndUser: And it's just, it's really robust. It's something that [PERSON-21]'s user is really valuing the system. So that's the feedback I usually got about that capability. I love it.
EndUser: We're doing quite a bit of manual searching by email to determine, the patient journey, where they're at, how you know,
Agent: Many emails have been sent.
Agent: And yeah, again, quite labor intensive, so this simplifies it. So far, very impressed.
Agent: Yeah, like [ORG-36] is, I'm sure [PERSON-5] is saying, but like we're Like, the bill will have these like preliminary conversations, and then we'll have, obviously, something pop up on our calendar.
Agent: But like, we, I, use this, like, religiously just to go through, like, the activity that the bill's having, catching up on calls, emails, whatever may be, without even having a conversation with the bill. It's super helpful. OK.
Agent: So imagine everything goes well. We've had all the great dialogue with [PERSON-15]. We can move him into, like, a converted stage, meaning we'll take him from a lead and now make him, like, a fully active patient within.
Agent: Within [FAC-1]. So what I'll do is I'll flip over to different app, meaning it's all the same platform. It's just a way of just organizing the different components based maybe on a given user.
Agent: So when I flip over to care coordination, we might present like a different home page for a care coordinator. So we're moving away from intake and lead conversion into providing now care amongst our patient population.
Agent: And I might have a different home page associated with that with like tasks that I'll get into that might be driven from a care plan where I might have some pre and post procedure activities to complete.
Agent: Then on the right-hand side here, you're seeing more of our enhanced analytics. I showed some of the standard reporting at the beginning. But if we wanted to, I think that [PERSON-15] called us out.
Agent: It's like our [GPE-6] embedded functionality within our [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: So if we wanted to understand just adherence to maybe any post-op activity that we wanted patients to follow, we can report on that and provide like really great analytics and insights for users.
Agent: To not that the supplies, but if we had like a readmission risk or a reimbursement risk, if you will, if they're trending on in terms of like a fully healed shoulder, that we fully guaranteed to resolve, we might have maybe some data points around like the post-op of tracking these assessments and data to kind of populate to say, hey, these are like the top risky patients that might warrant a reimbursement if we don't action to obviously treat their shoulder fully.
Agent: So that's some of the deeper insights we could accomplish with our analytics suite. But what I'll do is I'll flip over to what, again, like this could all be tailored by like what a patient profile could be represented.
Agent: We have it a large architecture, just to handle all the different elements that might be associated with a given encounter. We follow the, like what you'll hear, like the HL7 fire protocol.
Agent: So we map our architecture to what's standard globally or what's emerging, obviously, as a standard globally of interacting with different health systems or different health applications. But just a standard way of just categorizing and managing our data accordingly.
Agent: So on the left-hand side, what I mean by this is that we might have a robust related list of information stemming from maybe any medications that we want to track or just be mindful of, to maybe any allergies, to immunizations, whatever it may be.
Agent: We have these standard components that you can leverage. And as you begin to chart, you could update them accordingly as you see fit.
Agent: So I know that's to be determined with regards to Implementation design, but saves obviously a lot of build, say from a [PERSON-1]'s point of view, of creating these objects or these components from the ground up.
Agent: What I want to call out here, obviously all that great information that we capture at the front end with regards to details can be mapped into just their high level account information.
Agent: But we have to go ahead and schedule maybe this procedure for [PERSON-15] at one of our locations. So standard again within our product is what we call scheduler.
Agent: So this could walk an end user through logic with regards to the type of appointment that [PERSON-15] is looking to have.
Agent: So this could range of seeing a lot of examples here, but we might have like an initial consultation assessment as an appointment type, all the way to actually the procedure taking place.
Agent: And with each of these, and I'll just use consultation as an example, each of these will warrant obviously different maybe types of appointments.
Agent: So we might want to maybe make consultations virtual just to make it really easy versus having that obviously in clinic like a procedure.
Agent: And then part of this as well, depending on the location, will have like different providers, I'll use emphasis go as an example. We'll have different providers associated with obviously the locations.
Agent: And then with the providers, they'll have potentially different skill sets to be able to accommodate these different appointments.
Agent: So I know we won't have too many, but you might have obviously different individuals managing the consultation versus the actual procedure.
Agent: So it's just a way of one organizing our clinics, the resourcing associated with that, the rooms, the assets that we need to perform the procedure, the materials that might be consumed.
Agent: So really just easily walk the end user through to say, I'm thinking this appointment. I don't have to think about all the back end information that's required. Here's the availability based on everything that's predicated.
Agent: On the type of appointment that I'm trying to assign.
Agent: So we'll see the availability now, say, from [PERSON-19] to have that consultation in our [GPE-7] or [GPE-8] clinic, wherever it may be, to go ahead and schedule say that our consultation for [PERSON-15] virtually with [PERSON-19].
Agent: So guys that end user through, but this could be, again, applied to procedures taking flight, any follow-up appointments that we might want to conduct as well. But really, standard functionality that we can take advantage of
EndUser: And manage both like multiple locations multiple time zones whatever maybe Perfect Yeah, the doctor currently just fires off on our group chapter her availability for consults. I'm assuming the [ORG-31] coordinator can input that and then we'll know and
Agent: Then schedule accordingly if I'm on the line and I'll have visibility and schedule this way. Yeah, absolutely. And then like if you like whether using like Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, you can make these appointments.
Agent: Like they don't have to just be appointment records with a salesforce. Well, we could create like a an external record that can populate, like an Outlook and Google Calendar.
Agent: So the physician, if they're like always referencing that, says their appointments pop up immediately.
EndUser: Tool, they'll see these
Agent: That's synchronization. That'd be great. Perfect. So last piece here.
Agent: Just the call out, so on the appointment record, this is just an example of how we could begin to chart maybe within that appointment, whether it's posts, whether it's a consultation, whether it's the procedure itself.
Agent: But stemming off of. maybe this employment record, we can again embed another assessment or charting within it.
Agent: So taking that same great technology, again, this is just an example of [ORG-31] that we could use at the front end in terms of the intake that we could use actually during the procedure itself of just whatever we need to chart.
Agent: So I know we have like, then to be able to have that example of highlighting the different body parts and the pain, etc.
Agent: But as we go through like what parameters do we need with regards to charting that we want to embed maybe within the appointment record itself or on the patient chart where we can obviously Dictate these some of these values.
Agent: So again, just another example, but that same piece goes with regards to embedding like this really powerful user
EndUser: Tool, just the guide them through what they should be capturing in either case, whether it's in-taker charting. To simplify the process, I'm assuming this is all customizable so we can have the different rotator cuff muscles.
EndUser: So, you know, sub-ispenetis, [GPE-9], or whatever it may be, and then have those
Agent: Underlying complications, these little checkboxes that can be kind of clicked off. That'd be pretty cool.
Agent: Yeah, so [PERSON-15] showed a really great one that obviously is more tailored towards a use case but So even on, say like a pharma example, like there's all these programs that they run and like when you're making it in enrollment, like what's the indication and based on an indication presenting different values thereafter.
Agent: So exactly to your point, like that same functionality could be applied to your use case, but absolutely could be tailored to the trigenics. And that's about all I had for you.
Agent: Let me just jump out, call it maybe a few more things. Again, in terms of So in terms of post-op, I could run those same assessments, just understand again how they're progressing with regards to their treatment.
Agent: Care plans, I spoke to TASC a little bit earlier.
Agent: I know I have some diabetes ones here, but this is a way of saying this is like a right shoulder hair plan, meaning obviously we'll have like the initial consultation task, like go schedule that, check that off.
Agent: And then we'll have maybe post-up follow-up.
Agent: So this is just a way of just organizing the team around some of these tasks that we could categorize as problems, goals, or just tasks themselves, but associated with each of these categories would just be the the actual task themselves just to help them manage X, Y, and Z as a transition out of our clinic.
Agent: So this is a way we could templatize it and then have like a really tight post-op follow-up that the team can follow and make sure that no one's falling through the cracks or having that potential reimbursement conversation if they're not progressing well.
Agent: And then the last but not least, again, Marketing can be lockstep here, the engagement side from all his perspectives so we spoke to the [ORG-10] ad side of it.
Agent: As a engagement as they're going through treatment, like we might have a different journey that [PERSON-5] was alluding to, that might be a pre and post procedure. So we'll be mindful of when their appointment is.
Agent: And then we'll follow up automatically at scale, say just checking in how they're feeling, and then we can drive them again via a [ORG-31] point to your website to complete maybe self-service estimates and have that data submitted back into the [PRODUCT-6] here for us to review.
Agent: And then we could, again, invoke those deeper insights to see any risk with regards to not making [PERCENT-6] recovery. But I'll leave it there.
Agent: Any final questions, comments?
Agent: Definitely welcome. But I'll pass it to [PERSON-15] just to give some good time, just as wrap up, and then for you to make yourself available for your next call. But I appreciate the
EndUser: Time [TIME-5]. No, thank you for the description.
Agent: It's really exciting to see this all in one spot
Agent: Yeah, I suppose was there anything
EndUser: Else that you wanted to see anything else you want us to touch on?
EndUser: No, I mean other as obviously once we dive into this we'll be able to give you a lot of information as to what we want. We check boxes.
EndUser: I mean, I'd want every single muscle there from, and it doesn't just have to be shoulder because we often have patients come in for their shoulder and then they have any hip concern.
EndUser: So yeah, knowing that it's customizable, I really know questions. I'm excited to dive in and obviously there's going to be some type of
Agent: I guess the team that I work with that who helps.
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: That may come out in the implementation.
Agent: So for the number, that is really just a little bit of scoping, so with [PERSON-1], with [PERSON-2], with industrious, just getting a session in with them, just so they can have [TIME-6] just to make sure, based on what you saw [DATE-1], what's in, what's out, anything else that potentially we miss, that you want to bring in as well or that you want to make sure that is functional in the system so that they can give you at least an estimate on what this is going to cost from implementations to.
Agent: Standpoint. My job is to give you the license pricing, like me and [PERSON-4] put together [GPE-10] e pricing.
Agent: But with [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] that are going to put together the actual delivery price So we need both to actually give you a solution, a working solution at least .
Agent: So in terms of a scoping session, [TIME-6] is okay to meet you with that. It'd be sufficient just to kind of at least get you
Agent: Guys a rough order of magnitude to. I think an hour would be sufficient tops, but
Agent: Maybe [TIME-7] we can start with [TIME-6] and then what we can do another quick follow.
Agent: Do you have access to [PERSON-2]'s calendar?
Agent: [PERSON-23] calendar?
Agent: Not currently, I can, but I'll make sure to follow up with his like. I mean, I have access to his calendar, so I looks like I'm saying so I'll assume that I'm seeing the right calendar.
Agent: It looks like he's available at nine. to [DATE-15], 9 to 15, or [TIME-8] if you want it to [DATE-23].
Agent: This sounds like my team. If we want to do [DATE-23], yes, one two two should be fine, but I'd like to follow
Agent: Up with him real quick first. Sure, I'll hook it in and then we'll just make sure
Agent: If it doesn't work all over the same.
Agent: Is that okay, [PERSON-13]?
Agent: Does [DATE-23] work?
EndUser: I'll be
Agent: Done. [TIME-9]. [TIME-10] works. OK. OK, I'll put it in so that it's in the calendar. And then I'll just confirm with [PERSON-2] to get a hold. But appreciate your time [DATE-1]. You'll see that.
Agent: That one, as soon as the Recording is ready, I'll send And if you have time, check out the those out.
EndUser: That over to you. pan demos as well.
Agent: Check I think another whole thing for your clinic potentially is [ORG-36]. because I'm not sure it sounds like you're using WhatsApp or some sort of group chat
EndUser: To communicate.
Agent: Slack could be a great way to kind of have everything integrated as well from a chat standpoint.
EndUser: So everything's in one knowledge base.
Agent: So that kind of working as a clinic, everybody's kind of coordinated. You can share [ORG-1] records directly in [ORG-36] as well. So it's all kind of integrated.
Agent: It's a nice way to kind of have internal meetings with your team.
EndUser: Yeah, I know that I'll take a look at I know he
Agent: Sent like three emails with Yeah, with some canned videos. Yeah, so if you have time to take a look at some of those, it'll be
EndUser: Good for from a scoping standpoint to And dr. Oh wants the wants to take a look at this and I also want to send this to my T as an education coordinator As well.
Agent: So yeah, absolutely perfect. Yeah, I'll send the Recording over to you. Sorry one question for you in terms of stuff I just wanted to get the right size Is this about five users
EndUser: That's going to be within the system?
Agent: Yeah, four or five.
EndUser: Okay, we're both five. And including obviously, the doctors, myself and the patient coordinators, right now we have one slash two. So yeah, I would say five.
Agent: Okay sounds good.
EndUser: Okay. Well appreciate
Agent: That.
Agent: Thanks guys. Have a good day.
Agent: Wonderful. Thanks",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of the company and product throughout the call. They explained how the platform can help centralize data, automate manual processes, provide visibility, create a single record of the patient, and support scalability. The rep also discussed the benefits of integrating with other applications and future-proofing the customer's business.

However, there are a few instances where the rep could have further emphasized the value proposition:

1. When discussing the patient 360 feature, the rep mentioned that it would help the customer get 53 additional patients per month, which could potentially mean $58 million in revenue. This is a strong value proposition that could have been highlighted more prominently.
2. The rep mentioned that the platform can help the customer optimize their marketing spend, but they didn't provide specific examples or data to back up this claim. Providing concrete examples or case studies could have made this value proposition more compelling.
3. The rep briefly mentioned the potential for an app in the future, but they didn't delve into the specific benefits it could provide. Discussing the potential use cases and value of the app could have made this value proposition more tangible.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition, but there were a few missed opportunities to further emphasize the benefits of the platform.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So, [PERSON-15], do you want to just quickly go over a more good one?"", where the sales rep asked the customer if they wanted to go over a more detailed use case. The customer seemed more engaged as they provided additional information and asked questions.
2. ""And then you can also have journeys to get them to that surgery piece as well. And also alumni relations. So if you want them to be advocates and endorsing, you know, what [PERSON-8] does, which I think"", where the sales rep discussed the possibility of using the platform for patient advocacy and endorsement. The customer seemed more engaged as they asked questions and provided feedback.
3. ""So, you know, potential patients that you know have intent right there. Clearly interested in a solution, but for whatever reason, you know, maybe [DATE-15] just wasn't the time to get in touch or maybe something else went on."", where the sales rep acknowledged the customer's interest in the solution and discussed potential reasons for not moving forward. The customer seemed more engaged as they asked questions and provided feedback.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer was concerned about the complexity and time required to integrate their existing intake form, which is currently fired off by email and links to their website, into the seller's product. They wanted to ensure patients could still fill it out independently, even if the care coordinator wasn't available to assist.
2. The customer was interested in understanding how the patient's insurance information would be managed within the system, specifically how to check eligibility and understand coverage, copay, and remaining costs.
3. The customer wanted to know if there was a way to send assessments or intake forms to patients to fill out online and have the data automatically populate the system, similar to how their current email-based intake form works.

These concerns were expressed during the conversation between the customer and the seller's representative. The customer asked questions and expressed their need for specific features or functionalities to address these concerns.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call appears to be positive. They expressed excitement about seeing the salesforce platform in one spot and appreciated the detailed description of the system's capabilities. They also agreed to a scoping session to further discuss the implementation and pricing. However, it is important to note that while the customer seems interested, no explicit confirmation of closing the deal was made during the call.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer did seem to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They expressed excitement about the potential of the product and its features, and mentioned several times that they see potential in the product for their use case. They also asked specific questions about customization and integration, indicating a serious interest in the product. However, they also mentioned that they would need to see more details and have further discussions before making a final decision.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the centralized source of truth and data that the seller's product can provide, as they are currently using a paper-based system which has limitations such as risk of floods, lack of analytics, and no automation. They also mentioned the potential for patient automation, organic growth, and remarketing opportunities as benefits of the seller's product. Additionally, they were interested in the potential for the product to help them get ready for AI and the ability to scale as their business grows. The customer also mentioned the desire for an app in the future to support value-added activities, engagement, and education for patients and prospects.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and pain points. However, there are a few areas where the rep could have spent more time to further understand the customer's needs:

1. Integration with existing systems: The customer currently has an intake form that's fired off by email and links to their website. The rep mentioned that this could be integrated into the seller's product, but did not explore the possibility of keeping the existing form and finding a way to integrate the data into the seller's product.
2. Customization of the assessment tool: The rep demonstrated the assessment tool, but did not ask the customer if they had any specific requirements or preferences for the assessment process. Spending more time understanding the customer's needs in this area could lead to a more tailored solution.
3. Competitor analysis: Although the rep mentioned that they have a strong business case, they did not ask the customer about any other solutions they might be considering or what factors are important in their decision-making process. Understanding the competition could help the rep better position their product and address any concerns the customer might have.
4. Contract and pricing: The rep mentioned that they would provide a rough order of magnitude for implementation, but did not discuss contract terms or pricing. Addressing these topics earlier in the sales process could help the rep understand the customer's budget and timeline for implementation.

Overall, while the rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs, there are a few areas where they could have spent more time to ensure that the solution is tailored to the customer's specific requirements.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information about any specific concerns the customer had that would prevent the deal from closing. The customer did express some interest in the product and asked some questions, but did not explicitly mention any major issues or concerns.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""So kind of just to recap a little bit about what we heard, just providing you a centralized source of truth, centralized data. You don't have that [DATE-1].""
2. ""And then ultimately getting to a single source of truth from a patient record, so clinical notes, billing history, insurance, all that being in one place.""
3. ""So, Anything else that you'd want to add?""
4. ""I don't know, if we're able to do 62 patients unilaterally, that's potentially 15 million a year, in terms of revenue. The thing I would look at too is like, the total addressable market.""
5. ""And then you can also have journeys to get them to that surgery piece as well. And also alumni relations. So if you want them to be advocates and endorsing, you know, what [PERSON-8] does, which I think""
6. ""And then from there, you see this bit here, where this is the question mark. So what this is doing in this offer is this is actually going to go kind of down into full controls here. You know, this is where you can set up based on the data about the person.""
7. ""And so if the answer is yes, and they booked, then you can send them a reminder. And a task to reach out to that person and to confirm them, right? Or source them, and you know, or what have you a push message.""

video_19753_167_6qr3y000000g4ckAAA,"Agent: Well, we resonate with what you are asking and what we're going to do is the same.
Agent: We are going to have our first level presentation [DATE-1] where we are going to showcase you what is the art of possible through [ORG-1], what all we understand about these allowers and where we have done this allower.
Agent: We'll be sharing that brief also. Obviously, this presentation or this demo, we are not going to do that.
Agent: We have not configured all of your requirement into this presentation, but we are going to showcase what is already there in our system so that you can resonate with them as well as you can see the scalable obviously the architecture part, the scalability, the agile and the customers who are using our software are having a high volume kind of a high volume which it can handle.
Agent: So all of these things would be covered. So what we have planned is almost a one, one and a half hour kind of a time frame for this.
Agent: I think if everybody's OK, so we can just start and let's make it a more interactive session, wherever you feel like we can skip those slides, wherever you feel like, we can spend more time on those slides or on that presentation part.
Agent: Yeah, makes sense So if that is fine, shall we start?
EndUser: To me.
Agent: Or should we wait?
EndUser: We can get started.
Agent: Inhale, [PERSON-1], is it possible for you to share the presentation?
Agent: Sure.
Agent: So what I do is I'll just give you a brief while [PERSON-1], share the presentation from our side, [GPE-1].
Agent: I am the account manager for Cast 30 and been handling Cast 28 as an account for [DATE-2].
Agent: I joined with my colleague [PERSON-2] who will be supporting us from [LAW-1] from the sales perspective and our colleagues [PERSON-1] who is our solution designer, senior solution designer and I believe [PERSON-3] has also joined who manages the solutioning for [LOC-1].
Agent: I think he would be joining or he must have joined. I'll just check.
Agent: So what I'll do is, do you want us to just quickly run through what [ORG-1] is all about or have you ever?
Agent: Worked on sales for the earlier because these slides though your you know peers would have seen these slides earlier But we'll just quickly glance through these slides
EndUser: And then straight away move to the Presentation or the covering the functionality which we have understood.
EndUser: Would that be fine?
EndUser: Yeah, it makes sense. So I haven't actually interacted with this every scene in the past. So I would like to sort of understand a bit more as well.
EndUser: In terms of your current engagement with [GPE-2], but my understanding is that
Agent: For our international businesses, [ORG-1] is being used as a [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: That's the right understanding, right?
Agent: Yes, so [ORG-1] is being individual, by your [PERSON-4] division, as well as for your [GPE-3], for the buy-in [GPE-3], they're using it for post-sale service.
EndUser: Used by your Yeah.
Agent: So they are not managing the leads and opportunities to this, but they are managing the call centers, the technicians, the dispatcher, everything, those sales after the, you know, customize onboard it, how you are managing them.
Agent: For [GPE-4], you are using a, you know, platform solution for the leads management, where you are managing your finance team is managing for your finance, for your franchisees.
Agent: And [PERSON-5] from your team, [PERSON-6] from your team is managing, is leading that. [ORG-2] and [PERSON-7] within [PERSON-5] is leading that part. Apart from that, you are also using our extended solutions.
Agent: You are using Salesforce Tableau, you are using for all your [ORG-3] reporting, that's a group fight, as well as you are using [ORG-4] for your Workflow management.
Agent: So, though... you are using in fragmented think it's a good install base for us for [PERSON-8] default.
EndUser: Manner but I
Agent: Got it, useful.
Agent: Okay, so thanks for joining and thanks for you know sparing your time and that was very you know fruitful in our last presentation also where your team you know showcased and you know about your requirements in detail, which was very helpful for us two formulate this presentation.
Agent: Thanks, can we move to the next slide please?
Agent: This is a, okay, this one was a forward-looking statement, so just believe as what we are going to showcase as is, and just believe on what is there available as of now. So just setting up the agenda.
Agent: [DATE-3] what we are going to do is we are going to do our first salesforce introduction, a couple of slides, then our understanding and the proposed solution for you are in the authentic base of the requirement that you have explained to us.
Agent: And based on our experience that a lot of our customers are using our [NORP-1] solution. We do a brief demo. This is a, don't consider this as a final demo.
Agent: This would be a first level demo and it would be evolved while we go through.
Agent: What's the business value that you are going to drive from using [ORG-1]?
Agent: Obviously, you mentioned the agility, the scalability, but there are much more things that you can generate from looking at a [ORG-1] solution as a one-stop shop for you.
Agent: So please consider [ORG-1] as a kind of a holistic picture, not just looking at a one fragmented part. And as you mentioned, what all you can do with [ORG-1].
Agent: Obviously, then we'll be covering our next step and the [ORG-5] session. [ORG-5] session could be at the end, but if there is something major, we can cover it during the presentation also.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-9] can we move to the next slide. So this is one slide which we need to showcase to you.
Agent: And while you are looking at this for the first time, [ORG-1] as an organization, if you see, we have grown [DATE-4] on [DATE-4]. We started from 2.3 billion in the 511 [DATE-1], but we are at the 1.4 billion.
Agent: And that's the kind of growth. It's all because of customers like you. So we believe that customers like you who shows trust in us, who thinks that we are going to bring that value.
Agent: That's how our company has grown [DATE-4] on [DATE-4]. So what we say when we call it as a [PRODUCT-1], so we are not just a [PRODUCT-1] company.
Agent: If you see we are in number one in [PRODUCT-1], we are number one and I'm talking on the right hand side of the slide if you can just go through those tabs.
Agent: There's a big gap on what we say. We are number one in [PRODUCT-1]. We are number one in sales. We are number one in customer service, as well as in marketing.
Agent: So it's sales of [PRODUCT-1] is just one part of our donut.
Agent: If you see onto the left-hand side top left, what we see as a donut is sales is just one part that we are going to cover, what we were discussing.
Agent: But there are a lot more that as a sales force, we can offer.
Agent: Right now for your [GPE-5] as well as for your [GPE-3] they are using the second but if we go clockwise the service part they are using from our site they are having some part of sales but they are just using service under sales and there's lot much to offer to you so [DATE-1] what we are talking about is more of an industry solution which we are going to cover rest at the scalability and the agility which we were discussing and you know over [DATE-5] I've been having some discussions with your city also [ORG-6] and that was his point also how well we are on the Integration part how What is [PERSON-10] was?
Agent: How much less bugs are there and how easy is how flexible it is for you to, well, obviously there is a scalability, there is an energy-litty part, but how well your people are accustomed to use it and how fast they can use it without looking into a lot of things.
Agent: There would be some configurations which needs to be done, but how well and how flexible it is for you. Just if we move to the next slide please. And I'll just hand over
Agent: The button to my colleague [PERSON-13], who would be taking the presentation forward and then we will take it. So Harish, over to you please. Thank you so much so much. Hi, Anquis, hello, everyone on the call.
Agent: So I think this slide represents in terms of our length and breadth, in terms of our presence in the [ORG-7] world, right?
Agent: When we say financial services, it starts from the banking wherein you have a set and liabilities on the both side.
Agent: Where in your fintechs as well like phone pay, you know, weighty of even the credit rating agencies like [PERSON-11] or [PERSON-11] as well.
Agent: And then again on the insurance side as well, a universal sump and so on and so forth.
Agent: And predominantly I think our conversation [DATE-1] again is revolved around the NPFC space which is you know cast on 31 from a financial service perspective.
Agent: You not only want to lend to your own captive customers, but probably broaden the horizon wherein you want to maybe start a CD loan itself.
Agent: And just to give you a perspective, I think, because you said you're looking for a product for a platform for future. And I'll just move on to the, of course, there are logos here.
Agent: If you want to understand what specifically we're, kind of dealing with any of these customers, more than happy to have an offering discussion, but just to make sure we can best utilize our time as well.
Agent: I'm just gonna move on to the next slide, so I'll show if we can go.
Agent: So I think just to give you a balance in terms of, I think one of the question was around scalability and the future, I can say that, the judge themselves started their journey, I think close to 11 years now.
Agent: I think they've been, using [ORG-1] close to 4028 products. When I say product, it could be right from you r 2-wheeler loan to 4-wheeler to your personal loan since on so forth, right over drafting and everything else.
Agent: So that kind of sets the precedence in terms of scalability o f the solution.
Agent: And in terms of flexibility for you to launch a product, right, because [DATE-1] a personal loan can have multiple variations, etc, in terms of over drafting, in terms of credi t line and so forth .
Agent: How easily you are able to tailor made and kind of launch into the market. That's where in salesforce, as you know, is good in terms of platform.
Agent: And I think these are predominantly few of the metrics is if you look at it.
Agent: And again, I think the low and journey, what we have seen is depending upon the type of loan, let's suppose when you go into a personal loan, right, your it's a typically a state through process.
Agent: The processing time should be maybe [TIME-1], right, or a CD loan as if somebody looking to buy a mobile phone at a promo, right. So those kind of.
Agent: And you know when you look at when you're processing that loan there is I would say maybe around 23-40 Integration touch points which happen because you have to get data from fraud check to cursor to and so and so forth and build a multi-viewer score and so and so forth and then the that is what we are supposed to happen.
Agent: So, all those journeys is kind of done. So, specifically, let us first take example of [NORP-2] car filter. Traditionally, they were taking [DATE-6].
Agent: You can take an example of home loan in their perspective, wherein in home loan, there is a field check as well. There is multiple other attributes which comes into the picture, how we can reduce that.
Agent: And typically, I think the [ORG-8] finance as well, what we do is for every process, we have a TAT in place.
Agent: So [DATE-1], what is that [ORG-9] which is taking at a very stepwise, and I would say within a step, what is the time taken?
Agent: And then they start re-engineing on it, how we can actually reduce that [ORG-9]. Essentially, at [DATE-7], what they want to do is somebody landed on their platform.
Agent: What is the minimum time I can take to process that long?
Agent: So these are the key metrics in terms of I think the volume as well to give you a perspective I think for [ORG-10] you know on the [ORG-13] or even on the Diwali as well we process more than I think three lakh application in [DATE-8].
Agent: So that's just the volume we can actually take and probably more than happy to you know share more metrics if you want to look at the scalability perspective as well. But this is just to give you a glance.
Agent: Actually if you can move on to the other one.
Agent: So I think fundamentally, when we look at [ORG-1] platform from a loan journey perspective, these are three pillars which we have seen, which we kind of working with the likes of even [ORG-11] or the [ORG-11] or the I think [ORG-10] or I would say [ORG-11].
Agent: I mean, in [GPE-4] top eight [ORG-18], they are using [ORG-1] for their loan products, which could be multiple variant, which could be there.
Agent: So, the journey starts with which is a pre-application piece wherein you know there is somebody has shared a basic information which is the pan itself, but because you would need pan to identify or qualify a lead right once you have a pan you know there is a eligibility.
Agent: Then there is an application process which gets started which you can say mortgage process. It could be setting the fundamentalists across different loan products this is the journey which is there of course the nuances will change.
Agent: A person role will have different ones, a 2-wheeler will have a different ones and 4-wheeler, but highly these are the three pillars which happens. One is your pre-application.
Agent: Second is your mortgage process, wherein the application have processing fraud check and all those things are taken care.
Agent: Then the underwriting and post and then I think once the underwriting is done, the disbursement piece that's wherein the [ORG-1] preview ends, we typically the loan management is done on some other application.
Agent: It could be a thin one or you know, let's suppose any existing ERP which you have wherein your loan management is done. And then post, you know, once you pass on to the loan management system.
Agent: How you can enable your collections as well. Because a lot of customers face this issue as well that see, it's very easy to actually, I would say, give a loan.
Agent: Right?
Agent: There are a lot of people who are looking for loans, right?
Agent: But getting the money back from the people, how you have to define those [DATE-9], how do you do those collections as well?
Agent: Because there would be, you know, in terms of collections, of course, there is [PERSON-11] and all those, there is online basis as well.
Agent: But there is sometimes you have to assign a field agent as well, right, to the collections as well and so on. So all those elements are also covered on the same [NORP-3].
Agent: So I think these are the three pillars. which kind of I think helps us to kind of give it a one platform for all our customers as well who are using [ORG-1].
Agent: Plus of course you know you have only channel in terms of the case resolution, you have contextual analytics and so forth but I think just to sum it up these are obviously three pillars which we have in place.
Agent: I think moving on I'll hand it over to [PERSON-1] to run us through
Agent: In terms of the demo as well or what exactly the key specifics are there in terms of our loan Thanks, thanks, [GPE-6]. Welcome everyone [DATE-1].
Agent: So, the discussion that we had in the last call was primarily with respect to the journey that cast 30 has fallen. [DATE-3], we are going to cover two journeys.
Agent: Primarily, we will cover the lead management as well as the loan origination management.
Agent: In case, I mean, if you are interested in going for the four sales support, right, the journey that you want to see, we can schedule another session for it.
Agent: And I think with respect to lead management as well as a loan origination, [ORG-17] has already covered all of this.
Agent: So what we will be going to cover [DATE-1] as a part of journey is that we have three personas here, right?
Agent: [PERSON-18], [PERSON-17] and [PERSON-17]. So what will happen is the loan, [PERSON-18] is a particular lead for cast 23 who is looking for a used vehicle and want to win a loan as well from that particular.
Agent: Now, [PERSON-18] will be reaching out to you through a variety of different modes, whether it is through your website, whether it is through your [ORG-17], whether it is through any other mode.
Agent: All of these modes are integrated with [ORG-1] and through website or through any other medium, the lead will get automatically generated in [ORG-1] and the lead will get assigned to the right person.
Agent: Based on the rules that you will define, it will automatically get assigned to an RM. Now, once the lead is assigned to an RM, he will quickly contact [PERSON-18].
Agent: Let's say that, he wants to discuss with respect to what vehicle are you thinking to take and then . what kind of flows that you are interested in.
Agent: So he will have a call with the [PERSON-18] and then once he has a call with the [PERSON-18] through the mobile app itself, he will quickly be able to make a data entry into the system itself through the mobile app.
Agent: He'll be able to. get a functionality where you will be able to upload all the documents whether it is pan, [ORG-21], any [ORG-18] related documents and he will quickly add all those details.
Agent: So, once your lead is submitted and the documents are uploaded automatically the system will again it will be integrated with your third party systems and it will give you value wherein you know whether she'll pay is eligible for the loan or not.
Agent: So, the first part of process through the prospect we are checking whether she is eligible. for a loan or not based on radio parameters .
Agent: Now, once you have eligible, the system will generate an application in the back end and the application on sales force will be handed over to the underwriter. Once all the details have been verified.
Agent: So now, [ORG-21] will again re-verify all the details based on the scores. He will check eligibility and all the details are matching or not.
Agent: And if at all, sometimes what happens is though, it may not be very relevant for Class 23 as of now because in future you are expanding.
Agent: Now, let's say if it is a home loan, we can also initiate field verification from the system itself.
Agent: Now, the [ORG-21] will check all the details and based on his verification, the credit officer will then submit it for approval to the credit manager, manager or the [ORG-18] manager .
Agent: Now, once the loan is being approved automatically the loan application or the document will get generated and will be sent to the customer over the email for the e-signature.
Agent: And once the signature is being done automatically, system captures the details that the loan is accepted by the customer and it will be ready for this person.
Agent: So this is the cycle that we are going to follow in our demo.
EndUser: Any queries, anything you want to ask earlier right now?
EndUser: Okay, specifically for me and [PERSON-21], you should also add if there are questions that you have. But specifically for me, actually I would like to, go a bit deeper into, let's say one part of the process.
EndUser: So let's understand that. I'm sure [PERSON-18] for a sort of spoken to you about this.
EndUser: There are multiple steps to our journey, right?
EndUser: So the step number one is we call it sourcing, but essentially the step really is getting the customers' interest for the loan application, right?
EndUser: The customer is interested. Now, this can, in our current set of channels, there are two channels. There is a lead that can come from a customer, from a customer or an external dealer customer.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: For both of these channels essentially, then the lead can come in this way.
EndUser: The customer might express the interest on the cost 31 app itself and might want to let's say proceed with the and let's say the sourcing journey is still a collection of bank statement from the customer.
EndUser: So the customer can do it completely DIY on the customer default app. If the customer drops off, an agent might reach out to the customer. So our first preference obviously is that the customer does it DIY.
EndUser: No agent has to talk to the customer to get this done. If the customer is not able to do it, then my agent reaches out to the customer and helps. customer do it.
EndUser: So this is for a customer and for a dealer channel customer, dealer [ORG-21], or dealer agent is doing it on behalf of the dealer customer and we are very quick, very soon launching a dealer front-end as well, where the dealer would be able to do it completely DIY as well.
EndUser: So
EndUser: The journey till sourcing essentially is the customer's express interest given is. Basic information has seen a pre-approval offered.
EndUser: We have gotten a [PERSON-21], we have asked the customer to give a bank statement if required, and now we are asking the customer to move on.
EndUser: I would like to understand if the customer is now doing this fully DIY on the app or the dealer is doing it, how does that work?
EndUser: If the agent has to step in and help the customer, either a dealer [ORG-23] or a customer [QUANTITY-1] app agent, how would he step in and how would he do it?
Agent: Sure,
EndUser: Sure. Right. So basically, the eighth part, so we have to do that.
Agent: So I'm going to push with respect to [DATE-1]'s journey because this was, I think we have done it [DATE-10] only.
Agent: So what we have prepared for [DATE-1] is basically the from your lead getting assigned to an RM and then it is the loan getting dispersed.
Agent: So what I am saying is that I will be able to showcase this particular set of journey we can schedule another session that particularly on sourcing and we can customize a demo for you wherein you can define the process that you are looking for and we can show it to you over the next call.
Agent: Would that work?
EndUser: Sure. So let's stick to what you're talking about.
EndUser: So anything early getting assigned to an You are talking about an underwriter, right?
Agent: Rm. Yeah.
EndUser: There is a credit and agent who is underwriting the case after it has been assigned to him.
Agent: So [PERSON-18] is basically is?
EndUser: [GPE-7] is that what RM
Agent: No, I mean, see this is basically your sales agent who is working to, you know, qualify a prospect.
EndUser: Now, I think he had basically in our case, right?
EndUser: Have to understand that for a lot of the customers, there will be no relationship manager, right?
EndUser: The customer would be doing a DIY.
Agent: Yeah, right.
EndUser: So let's sort of break this up. Right.
EndUser: So first customer who's come on a cost 29 app, right?
EndUser: One. Priority one is the customer is able to do it fully DIY priority to is if a agent has to assist the customer We have also broken the agents into different parts of the customer.
EndUser: So there is no dedicated RM who is with the agent who went through the agents are broken into different agent types. Okay, right, which helps the customer in different parts of the customer journey.
Agent: So, right?
EndUser: One is the sourcing agent which let's say getting all the documents on the customer, then there is a credit agent who is doing the underwriting, then there is a conversion agent who is doing negotiation, and then there is the ops agent who is doing the final processing and dispersing
Agent: The law.
EndUser: So through and through there is no RM who is with the customer.
Agent: Right. On the case
EndUser: Though, there is a central [ORG-23] who is helping the customer manage the process end to end. Right. But he's talking to the central teams of credit and ops to disperse the law.
Agent: So I think the definition of [PERSON-18] probably though we say it's RM, it's not a relationship manager in that sense, it's more of like somebody who's getting your lead in an offline way.
Agent: Now that lead could be somebody at your dealer as well, which is a cost 29 dealer affiliate or so and so forth, could be any kind of person.
Agent: So anybody who's getting the lead, we define it as an RM in our terminology, offline lead. Not he is just he's only thing.
Agent: Yes, he's supposed to do is just feed and lead right and he will get a commission out of it and so on so forth. Once his application is approved, his process kind of steps out. He's not into untenless.
Agent: You know, we have to involve him at some point of time to like the documents and so on so forth, which is not the case in most of the times.
Agent: But yes, he's scope and set as soon as there is an eligibility done.
Agent: The rest of the process is done by your underwriting game, the rest of the team, which sits in the back and it's up or even to the customer service team as a which is there.
Agent: Though as I understand, right, you know, what you're talking is from the assisted state-through process journey wherein there is an app and right as soon as and it's just like [ORG-30] at [DATE-7], right?
Agent: If you're running any kind of loans, the moment you drop, they will call you 111 times in [DATE-8] to get you that loan done, right?
Agent: So, yeah.
EndUser: So for us, most a lot of the customers would do the journey DIY and then the journey, the customer drops the agent calls the customer to help and the agents are supposed are divided across the different lifecycle of a customer and different stages of a customer's loan That's how it is.
EndUser: But what I'm hearing is that [PERSON-18] is there t o
EndUser: Specifically in the early stages of the customers anywhere
Agent: He is getting the information. It's not a thing to be around, it's not a banking prospector who's going to manage that relation, not absolutely not.
EndUser: Let's see how you guys have defined in [PERSON-18] and
Agent: We'll sort of call out if there is let's say deviation from our dark processes. Let's let's move ahead.
Agent: So just want to clarify like even if you see a deviation right it's just that we wanted to
EndUser: Really turn around fast and we are cognizant of those use cases we could you know come on them. Ah, of course. This doesn't need to be perfect guys.
EndUser: We'll keep it iterative, right?
EndUser: So let's do a discussion.
Agent: Let's understand how close you have been able to get to our process, where the
Agent: Gaps are, and let's define and let's iterate. Let's come to a comment. Fantastic. Fantastic. Thank you so much.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: I hope you guys can see my screen, right?
Agent: Yeah. All right. So this is the home of the RM right to who is getting you the leads.
Agent: Now when I go to the lead management dashboard, so these are the leads that have been generated in total [DATE-13] and then which particular rep or in your company has generated the maximum number of leads.
Agent: What are the leads by various business units and then what are the leads by various products. Now when I talk about the customer lifetime value, so you will be able to see these lifetime value matrix over here.
Agent: And then when we talk about primarily with respect to as you said that you want to scale in multiple different directions also with respect to the loans you want to introduce multiple products.
Agent: So all the products once on-boarded you will be seen over here like this where and you will be able to see that which Sales rep has you know sold maximum number of loans with respect to the products.
Agent: Then with respect to sourcing of leads, it could be multiple sources whether it is coming through your website to Marketing and through let us say from your dealer portal if you extend the system to your dealers.
Agent: So directly the lead will be generated from there and will be added over here in the pattern. So once it is being assigned added, then it will be assigned to a particular sales rep.
Agent: So basically this dashboard is nothing but how a particular sales guy will keep a track of his own performance and key metrics, right, when he starts his day.
Agent: So as a sales guy, I will start my day, I will look at these metrics and I will know that okay, this is what my performance has been and this is what the number of leads has been assigned to me.
Agent: Now I have to work on these particular things. So, through the mobile app itself, we will be able to get the visibility of his matrix.
Agent: And then once he goes back, he can also see the all of the leads that has been assigned to him.
Agent: So, once he sees all the leads, we can see that these are the leads and then there are applications that are assigned to the sales, the application that he has generated.
Agent: Now, let me just go to [PERSON-18], which is the lead that is assigned to the sales guy.
Agent: So once I open up this lead, right?
Agent: It will be a new stage. Let me just give you one.
Agent: So when I open up this lead, it will be a new stage because it has been assigned to me.
Agent: So what I will do is because I have all the details of [PERSON-18], I can view all the details from the app itself and I can quickly call it, shall, from that.
Agent: So once I call her, the system will actually prompt you to see what the discussion had been with [PERSON-18] over the call.
Agent: So, I can simply say over here that once a call is done I can say that interested in vehicle load.
Agent: And this will generate a law against [PERSON-18].
Agent: Now, why I'm showing you this is because with respect to this particular lead, if at all any of your manager or any person wants to get a view that what conversation has been happening on this particular prospect so far, so we can get a view of that particular cause or engagement that has been happening with [PERSON-18].
Agent: When I interacted with [PERSON-18], she said that she is interested in a vehicle loan.
Agent: Now what I will do is either I can visit at [PERSON-18]'s place or if [PERSON-18] visits car 28, we can check in or check out based on that.
Agent: So let's say I visit her, I can quickly check in to her location and my coordinates will be Recorded against the lease.
Agent: And it will make sure that your particular agent has actually or the safe rep has actually gone to [PERSON-18] and [FAC-1].
EndUser: Now once she wants to.
EndUser: This is something that would not happen in our case, right?
EndUser: Like either the customer is doing the process DIY or the agent is talking to the customer and doing this process on a call, right?
EndUser: The check-in
Agent: Network would not happen. But sure, let's go ahead. Yeah, so yeah, this I just want to add.
Agent: So of course, you know, imagine that this entire process is also available on our front end available So, you know, we could just, you know, start narrating in a way that this is application is being used by [ORG-29].
EndUser: To the customer.
Agent: So the process is like the process layer is common and the front we also have you know front-end capabilities which are self-serve
Agent: What Oxesh showing you right now is assisted journey. There's only difference here.
Agent: See again, unquestressed hold on to [ORG-30] one more thing that whether this particular lead or is being signed by a sales guy or whether she is doing it by herself.
Agent: Now if she is even doing it by herself and then what will happen is that let's say she has filled up all the details and she's interested in loan and she gets the eligibility check.
Agent: Now the application again can be generated from the back end and can be assigned the right here. So this of lead sourcing is that I'm showing that different ways to you know generate a prospect.
Agent: If at all she is a prospect part, we can directly generate an application also in a sign-a to let's say credit officer for further review.
EndUser: And she has done all that Right?
Agent: That can also happen.
Agent: Now, when she, as you said that the particular prospect can drop into the journey, right?
Agent: And when the, when particular prospect drops and the agent calls her, then you know why she, over the call itself, they can work with data entry. Even if let's say she, they are not.
Agent: Viewing it and using the mobile app, the same view will be given to the agents on the desktop wall. So they can do the same process with a desktop as well.
Agent: They can call up the customer because as you said that they are not going physically at their location, they will have the desktop or the laptop with them
Agent: And they can follow the same process through the desktop as well.
Agent: They can do the
Agent: Entire data entry of the application through the desktop as well. So, for your own digital property, So, let's see you're planning to build a front end, commerce front end. We also have commerce capabilities.
Agent: We could also plug into your commerce capabilities and expose these forms, which will be directly into the same funnel. So, again the process remain the same the fintant could change.
Agent: So, do you want me to I mean just want to ask I want to get your opinion as well do you want me to do this process through a desktop or the mobile
EndUser: App is fine.
Agent: All right. So as a particular agent, let's say calls, [PERSON-18] and he wants to make a quick data entry for [PERSON-18]'s documents, [PERSON-21] and all that stuff. So we will simply click on this button, quick data entry.
Agent: And once it clicks on quick data entry, all the details initially that we have gone through any of got through any of the Marketing platforms or through [ORG-17].
Agent: So we will have these all the details over here and we will click next. So once we click next,
Agent: So the system will ask to upload the documents of [PERSON-18], right?
Agent: Whether it is a pan or a dhar or any of the, this is again customizable. If you want to add any other parameters, you can add it over here.
Agent: So let me just select pan and while clicking, I can simply select the pan card over here, right?
Agent: And we can upload it directly from the mobile app itself.
Agent: So once we upload the details of pan, we can quickly go next and the system will be able to read through the image itself that this is the pan number, [PERSON-23] and Passport.
Agent: We can simply click next and we can verify the details for the [ORG-29] option.
Agent: So she will get the details on the [ORG-29], we will enter the [ORG-29] over here just to verify all the details and once we have verified all the details based on pan, [PERSON-23], Passport and the details that she will be submitted.
Agent: The rules will be evaluated in the back end and we will be able to know that okay whether she is eligible for the loan or not.
Agent: So this is a eligibility check and once she is eligible for the vehicle loan, we can simply click next and the application will get generated.
Agent: You will also see that application is generated automatically and it has opened up in the mobile app itself.
Agent: Right, so this is the application which is again with right now the sales agent or if you want to assign once the application is created, you want to assign it to credit officer, you can assign it to credit officer.
Agent: But that was a quick data entry that we did.
Agent: Now what we will do is we will do a detailed data entry on the application part because there is lot of information that is yet to be added and has to be verified by the credit and writer.
Agent: Just to make it just connect much answer.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: So here the application is generated and what we will do is we can simply do a detailed data entry.
Agent: So once we click over here on the detailed data entry, we will again get the details of [PERSON-18] and we will verify all the details so that these details are being matched by the prospect details that have been submitted.
Agent: So I will enter these details here and then it will ask us which vehicle to add.
Agent: So we once we select yes, it will ask us the vehicle details again you can customize the details of vehicles that you have whether let's say this is the [ORG-28] vehicle and the make is [ORG-28] and the model is it's a active of i and you can create your product master over here all the details of the vehicle.
Agent: So once we add next we can simply select a scheme if you are running.
Agent: At all let's say there are discounts or anything that you are running and we can add the scheme over here again this Code customizable you can change it as per your requirement as well what passed on the fourth volume right so there are no other vehicles so I'll just simply go to next based on the vehicle we will get a total on road price max tenure amount finance dealer id and dealer right so once these details are being verified over here we will hit next and We will get the bank details of [PERSON-18].
Agent: So we will enter the details of [PERSON-18]. And if at all we need any cancel check at this point, we can upload the cancel check from the mobile app itself.
Agent: Now this flow also captures that whether we want to, while taking a loan, whether we want to add a co-applicant over here or not.
Agent: So, if at all there are no poor applicants we can simply click next, we will move on.
Agent: Now, these are the interest rate over here right, what are the interest rate that you have been and if there are any processing charges we can add those processing charges over here that these are the processing charges and then we will simply click next and we will able to know that ok this is the [ORG-31] that has been calculated against the loan as well as the tenure.
Agent: Right?
Agent: On the mobile app itself or on the system itself, you will also be able to, you know, get a mortgage calculator and you will be able to know that, you know, that this is the [ORG-31].
Agent: If a customer asks you that, what will be my [ORG-31] per month?
Agent: We can tell from the mobile app itself or from the system itself as well.
Agent: So once we finish this up, if at all, though it is assigned to underwriting team, but let's say if I want to, you know, want to see the repayment schedule, I can see the repayment schedule as well from here itself.
Agent: So I can click on view and monetization schedule and I can get the entire schedule from here in the app itself. And we can then actually converse with the customer.
Agent: And we can tell him that this is the repayment schedule. And this is a [ORG-31] that you need to pay and how long it will be and all those details we can tell to the customer.
EndUser: Any, I'll take a pause, any queries, anything here.
EndUser: He can finish this for you here. Let's ensure that let's sort of try and come to an answer on.
EndUser: Let's say what would we need to do to let's say, get this a bit closer to what our current process is. And let's sort of think through what one [PERSON-30].
EndUser: To what extent it can be done and what would it take to get there?
EndUser: And also, for example, right now, the way I'm seeing this is, this is slightly different from what our current process is.
EndUser: So let's try and get this closer to what our current process is and think about the Josef Tanya. So for example, I think credits a parallel. Let's just stick to first.
EndUser: Taking the basic details from the customer, pan the cut details and figuring out low and eligibility, right?
EndUser: I want to sort of understand, for example, a few things that the way we have implemented, we ask the customer for pan information, income information, address information, we give the customer a pre-approval offer after that.
EndUser: So there is a internal DS rule engine which takes customers information around pan income [ORG-31] from pan. We first validate the pan. So essentially, for example, you showed OCR way of reading the pan.
EndUser: In our case, pan is We don't take a pan copy photo photo. And we ask the customer to enter pan information and to validate that this is the right pan.
EndUser: We hit it to a [ORG-23] API and figure out whether the pan information is correct for the customer or not, right?
EndUser: Once that is done, we fetch the customer's bureau record. This is the bureau record and customer self declared income. We create a pre-approved offer. We show the customer the pre-approved offer.
EndUser: And then we ask the customer to give banking, right?
EndUser: But we control.
EndUser: Move to banking later, but like, but so what you'll call it as a eligibility check, right?
EndUser: In our notion it is a pre-approval offer, but this is the way it is done. So it's a
EndUser: The fan details are not taken by an upload, it's entered and then validated with [ORG-23].
EndUser: We don't take at-heart at top of the funnel, right?
EndUser: So, customer is at OTV verification that does not happen. There is a, in addition to eligibility check, there is a pre-approval offer that is calculated that is shown to the customer.
Agent: Right?
Agent: We are asking that customer-
EndUser: We are asking that customer- We are asking that income and [ORG-31] and then basis that we are calculating a pre-approval offer.
EndUser: So, just want to understand, let's say if you have to implement that we have covered that we've done.
Agent: Process.
Agent: The process that Yeah, so [PERSON-29], can I just add a few points before we go to the Implementation aspects?
Agent: Yeah, so see, look, what we are trying to show is, you know, we have worked with large [ORG-18], but often being a largest customer and the various other, you know, you would have seen various customers over working with us.
Agent: Everyone does business in a different way.
Agent: Now, the way we have understood the industry works is, and what we're trying to basically deliver as a message is, [ORG-1] becomes the center, that layer which ties all the other systems together in the loan origination journey.
Agent: In which case, as you rightly mentioned, the kind of data that you capture and the way you fetch details and from where you fetch may differ.
Agent: So as you rightly said, in your case, you may not take the copy of the panel.
Agent: You may only take it as an input on a website and then make an API call to the government authorities as to man fetch that information. Of course, that can be done.
Agent: What we were trying to show is another way in which trying to show our capabilities that, okay, by the way, we also have OCR. Of course.
Agent: We could also do just taking a pan number We could also skip some steps and add steps As you also mentioned that there is a pre-approval offe r that is given And I'm sure you have a core system which generate s that pre-approval offer So we could integrate with that core syste m and fetch that offer So we are kind of trying to show the art of possibl e experience in the industry This is of course a standar d flow that we have configured
EndUser: In the time that we had. If we get a little bit more [PERSON-30] e, of course, we could come back with exactly what
Agent: You would like to [PERSON-29] for sharing. We don't have to get it to the exact, we don't even have to prepare a exact demo of what our process flow is.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, but essentially Just seeing the standard process doesn't How will this work for our case?
Agent: Help me visualize.
EndUser: Right and actually that's how I'm thinking about it.
EndUser: What I'm trying to sort of get out of this conversation is this right?
EndUser: Yeah We have two current channels to sell loans through.
EndUser: There is a dealer channel and then there is a car 29 app and then there are many more channels that will come And then there'll be new products that will be added as well.
Agent: In the future.
EndUser: But let's sort of stick to what the current two channels are. For these two channels, there is a current process flow that exists and then there is a variation between the two channels as well.
EndUser: For example, the pre-approval about, pre-approval for the car 31 customer does not exist for a dealer customer.
Agent: Offer that we were talking offer exists
EndUser: So there is a... Yeah. little difference there . What I'm trying to understand is.
EndUser: Are process flow the way we do loan origination?
EndUser: How easily it can how Can it be done with [ORG-23]?
Agent: Can it be mapped?
EndUser: And if yes, how easy difficult is it to do it, right?
EndUser: What would it take say.
Agent: To implement?
Agent: Let's
EndUser: [PERSON-28] offer for a customer, but no preapproval offer for a dealer's own customer.
EndUser: What would it, one, can it be done?
EndUser: Second, what would it take to actually execute and execute this nuance that it will be done for customer when not done for a de-resal customer?
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: So I'm trying to understand
EndUser: Feasibility cannot process the executor. Second, effort required, how hard easy is it to do these variations for different channels for different products.
EndUser: And when mean that there is a assisted channel, there is a DIY channel, then there is a dealer channel, then there is a cash 29 channel, right?
Agent: I'm saying channels, I also
EndUser: So for different channels, can How easy, difficult is it to do it?
Agent: These variations be executed?
EndUser: Yeah, I think that's, I think that's actually, I think to get this done, there will be a bunch of external integrations will be acquired, there will be some process re-engineing that would be required.
Agent: It's not worth a fact. feasibility and effort. Yeah, also I mean, yeah, all fair, very, very fair question and great that you're giving us these details.
Agent: I wanted to address your first question, you know, you know, and you would have, I'm sure already by now read, you know, one of the core capabilities of [ORG-1] is number one, whatever we make is channel agnostic, right?
Agent: A lot of our customers have increasingly asked for DIY channels and while in the, while in the, you know, in the credit like [ORG-28] industry, assisted channel, which is via a person, continues to have its own place It continues to be there So, one, of course, we have customers who are doing both [DATE-11], and it doesn't need to be a sales force front end in that sense For, let's say, DIY channel, it could be your website, we integrate .
Agent: We basically your website integrates into [ORG-1] to reutilize the core process which is used. A question answered to a second question. Of course, with various different channels, there could be steps which are either added or removed.
Agent: And we have a very strong Workflow engine which assists us to enable our customers, plug-in plug-out [PRODUCT-2] in those based on either a persona who's executing it or a process.
Agent: All those controls are already in place I think the third question which you had, which is a bit more specific
EndUser: As to how lon g it would take, of course, would need us some time for assessment And we can go into those details, but of course right now we don't have that answer .
EndUser: And how long is essentially also linked to the effort, right?
EndUser: What does it take to actually do it?
EndUser: Like is it, does it actually require some dev effort?
EndUser: Does it require, is it a plug-and-play work from a load where I can change the workflows?
EndUser: [PERSON-31] is something,
EndUser: Again, I like to understand. I have a question. But you want to ask something and be talking about this example. So my question is a bit of a <inaudible>, what you were asking on question.
EndUser: My is how it's to assemble the product in case of this, the home loan generally, right?
EndUser: But how it's to assemble the product is when the journey is alone against the asset and those assets could be of a different variety. The asset could be a car, could be a gold, could be a property.
EndUser: Like the variation goes assets how to transfer one again and second question is let's say if I have a lead or a customer but we also tend to have some other kind of a offering already part of my
Agent: Ecosystem who has taken some service with me how they get reflected and how that gets integrated here in the system.
Agent: Yeah, so [PERSON-23], I mean, of course, you know, and I'll just extend my previous narrative that, you know, you would, and possibly we should in detail take you through what are different customers in this space are actually doing on the ground.
Agent: For [ORG-33], this industry is one of our largest play and we are little doing, you know, serving all the top customers who are in into either disposing loans or disposing loans as [ORG-18] So I think that is merit in us taking you through it And the same force as the technolog y has that flexibility We don't differentiate between loa n against different kind of sets Once it
EndUser: Is configured for one, of course, it can work for the other If you just repeat your second question again is sort of, if we're, uh, your sense on this question as [PERSON-23] l, essentially what you're asking is this, righ t?
Agent: [ORG-39], deeper getting
EndUser: That for future product s, if let's say I'm launching a gold loan or a, uh, other one [ORG-31] e, how would that really work, righ t?
EndUser: S o. Oh.
EndUser: For future capabilities that we need, how would that be executed?
EndUser: And how would it be done?
EndUser: I said, can it be done and Right.
EndUser: And how means that it needs some development or how you do that?
EndUser: It's a product configuration.
EndUser: Right.
EndUser: How extensible that configuration
EndUser: Product has a platform in terms of extending the end. Second question. Sense of BIMAG actually for that. Leaving apart, let's say we should also talk about future products. But even for the current products, the different workflows
Agent: That we have, the different capabilities that we have, feasibility care and how would it
EndUser: Be done but yeah we should
Agent: Obviously look at the future products as well got it sense i mean as it's coming in Yes, that is what I was saying.
Agent: Got it so makes
Agent: Go ahead, yeah. So, I am question deep up to answer your question. So, for this demo, we already have all the products configured.
Agent: I think if you see and again the journeys would be completely the [ORG-39] journey that you will follow for the customer.
Agent: Different. It is not the same journey that you follow for and it is not the same
Agent: You are doing this the mobile one if you are showing something?
Agent: So, that's what I wanted to show, right?
Agent: So, these are all the products, right?
Agent: If you see over here, then a prospect coming through for with respect to different processes over here. And it is just not just the names that are written here. The entirely different process will be followed.
Agent: Now, when I talk about as a simple example, if I want to tell you about the system capabilities, let's say there was a vehicle loan. Now, the particular product is personal loan. Somebody has elected personal loan.
Agent: The data entry for a vehicle loan, and the data entry for the personal loan will be completely different. And it's on the same platform. So this is something that I want to highlight that
Agent: All these products can be mapped into the single platform with different processes altogether. Yeah, so extending to that the book and so basically product is a we have a master data entity for product.
Agent: There is a product table where you can go and configure a new product. And as you can imagine, that's very simplistic in a way.
Agent: And then as the treatment of what you do with the product is something what we call as workflows.
Agent: And from UI, you could invoke a single Workflow which could branch out based on the type of product which is selected or you could invoke a different Workflow altogether. like simplistically put.
Agent: So these are the two main ingredients which go into making the things configurable.
Agent: If you have a custom UI, let's say the new product has to be knowled on your web front end, of course, you would need to make some changes on the web front end.
Agent: But on [ORG-1], creating a new product is a configuration, exposing it to any channel is a configuration. Creating a Workflow is a configuration.
Agent: If there is an API call to be made, let's say for [ORG-37] check, of course that would require development effort.
Agent: Having said so, we have a lot of partners who would have already built some accelerators to invoke these APIs, because they would have
EndUser: Done this at some of the other customers. Yeah, see. So that where I am principally, I understand principally that already used by a lot of customers across a wide range of financial products, the capabilities, extensible and all that.
Agent: [ORG-1] is
EndUser: I'm trying to get a bit more into specifics. I'm trying to get a bit more into specifics of makes sense.
Agent: High level pay, this
EndUser: But let's pick up, let's say, and give us a sense of how exactly would that be done .
Agent: One part.
Agent: Of the Workflow Right?
EndUser: Okay. So it pre-approval you have it. Just get us. Let's pick up pre-approval or eligibility check and let's try and understand how would that be done for multiple channels and multiple product lines.
EndUser: And take to execute?
Agent: What would it really
EndUser: So there would be external integrations that would be required, for example, with [ORG-39] with [ORG-23]. Yes. General Integration be done.
EndUser: There would be Workflow changes that would be required for agent for [ORG-39] 18. agent versus a dealer channel agent, how would that be done?
EndUser: There would be let's sa y
EndUser: With our internal DS engine to create a pre-approval of how it does etc.
EndUser: So, specifics can say, can say, who go, feasible, and what would it take to execute it?
Agent: That will give us a sense of what the future would look like. Okay, understand.
Agent: So, how do you suggest we do that?
Agent: Of course, we have your document and our idea was to actually turn around very quickly show you so that at least you could visualize.
Agent: I think one thing which we could deliver to you successfully I'm wrong is that, okay, we have a capability to do it, but you are not like you still want understanding
EndUser: And please correct me if
EndUser: Of how quickly it would be done, right?
EndUser: Yeah, what I'm trying to understand is want to make Workflow changes.
Agent: For future as we
EndUser: Do more explanations.
EndUser: What does it really do these things with [ORG-39]?
Agent: Take to
EndUser: Okay, okay.
EndUser: For my current channels, what would it take to execute what I have?
EndUser: And for future channels that I have to make an what would it take to actually get that done?
Agent: Enhancement, some change in the workflow, so let me
EndUser: Understand know if this makes sense to you as well. No, no, it makes absolute sense because of the fact that actually, but sure.
EndUser: So I think the idea is to sort of get a sense of for our current channels and future channels, feasibility, [GPE-8], how would it get, how would it be done on [ORG-39]?
Agent: And what I'm recommending is we it for everything.
EndUser: Can pick up one part of the Workflow instead of trying to do Yes.
Agent: We can pick up one part of the Workflow and do a deep depth. Instead of trying to cover broadly everything makes sense, makes sense. No, no, makes sense.
Agent: So, unquish, you know, would it be in which case, you know, possible that you could share, let's say, a detail of the detail of what you would like us to cover and what are the key success KPIs which you would want to see for this event.
Agent: Like for example, you mentioned that, OK, let's deep dive into eligibility. What all aspects in that area
EndUser: Would you like us to cover?
EndUser: So that we could quickly do that and turn around for you.
EndUser: And then she should sort of work with the team on this, right?
EndUser: But within loan eligibility, what we should sort of check is. So imagine there are four different nuances of loan eligibility. There is loan eligibility on cash 30 app. There is loan eligibility on less a sales panel as well.
EndUser: There is loan eligibility on dealer channel front end. There is loan eligibility for a sourcing agent and then there is a loan agility for dealer app was.
Agent: So
EndUser: These are the five front ends where low-eneligibility is being checked for different type of customers. Okay. Let's imagine what are current capabilities for low-eneligibility are.
EndUser: What the current Workflow is that you ask for [WORK_OF_ART-1], [ORG-40], [ORG-40] details, validate, pan, hit [ORG-39] and we actually hit [ORG-10] first, right?
EndUser: So we hit [ORG-10] to understand [ORG-10]'s eligibility and vice the [PERSON-28] score from that. So you hit [ORG-10], hit internal DS, figure out what the pre-approved offer is, show the customer a pre-approved offer, if it is required.
EndUser: For dealer channels, we only show the [PERSON-28] score, right?
EndUser: And let's imagine that there are also future channels that we have to launch.
EndUser: So first let's understand, if we have to build this for our current channels, right?
EndUser: Feasibility [PERSON-33] can all of this be done and what would it take in terms of executing this on SFDC?
EndUser: Would that mean that we will have to do custom developments?
EndUser: Would that mean that there are just Workflow configurators Exactly.
Agent: That we would be able to use?
EndUser: What would it take [PERSON-33] effort like to actually execute this on SFDC?
EndUser: Right. Would this require integrate if it requires let's say [ORG-39] case on a one-on-one configuration.
Agent: With cast 21 app, right?
EndUser: I'm carrying a SFDC. Other things the Workflow that we have configured.
Agent: Are more complicated than
EndUser: So, what would it take to execute this pre-approval flow on five channels?
EndUser: And imagine that there are also future products that we want to launch. Let's imagine that we have to launch a [ORG-40] top-up product in the future, where we have to think about, giving the customer eligibility confirmation.
EndUser: This is what is current loan performances. With their, let's say we are not giving a repurpose offer, we are only giving a eligibility confirmation for a refinance loan.
EndUser: What would it take to also launch that capability in the future?
Agent: On again, the cost 30-app and a refinance.
EndUser: Yeah. Sure. Let's think about this. Let's think about
Agent: Just the eligibility check and figure out what would it take. Yeah. Of course.
Agent: So, point of contact?
EndUser: Is [PERSON-39] our Yes.
Agent: That's fantastic. That helps.
Agent: One thing which I wanted to address right away is that, [PERSON-31] that typically we [ORG-46] works is, you know, given that we are a product organization, while we do have services being as well, typically our partners or our customers themselves, once they purchase the services from us, they have the freedom to make changes as they deem.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So, let's say you two two do your own implementation, our customers do, and you build in-hous e capabilities, which is very fair, you know, most of the new-age companies like yours like tech organizations, would have very strong technical skills.
EndUser: Which is some of
EndUser: Who are more
Agent: They do it, right So you will have the freedom to make changes as you deem, because it's your org sales force wil l never have access to your data or your information, or even we won't be able to log in.
Agent: In case [PERSON-39] choose to contract with a partner, they would mak e those changes on the question around,
EndUser: You know, if let's say able to do it.
Agent: We would be I'm sort
EndUser: What does this mean?
EndUser: And of new to SFDCs on price.
EndUser: Is this does this me an that I will have SFDC engineers as engineers who understand [GPE-9] in-house who would be able to make changes to my version of SFDC and if yes, are they able to make these changes?
Agent: To what extent Right?
EndUser: Are they only change the front end?
EndUser: Are they also able to change the back end layer is levels the [LAW-2] change?
Agent: Platform change?
Agent: Because of things,
EndUser: Because of things. Understand.
EndUser: Is this something else?
EndUser: Is this a Workflow configurator that you guys have, which doesn't require any dev
Agent: And any business person here also [DATE-1]?
Agent: Okay, understand. I got I think we possibly may need to have a short 37 call with you to take you through how [ORG-46] is architected.
EndUser: A sense of your question.
Agent: And look, it's a cloud platform. We are multi-tenant. So being multi-tenant, there are certain things which you would not be able to.
EndUser: As a factor of us
Agent: For example, you can't go and update the database. You can do it from the UI, but with restrictions. All the same time, you get the same flexibility.
Agent: As you would get in any other application which is either on-premise which let us sa y you have created full stack.
Agent: You do have that flexibility to using the metadata UI, creat e new tables, create new UI in front of it . there are, you know, on that level, there is [PERCENT-1] flexibility.
EndUser: You know, you could in fact
Agent: Build your own applications with your own custom UIs while [ORG-1] has a standard UI, which is what you're seeing right now.
Agent: So I think this topic itself hour, whenever we will or whoever you nominate will take you through that.
EndUser: Possibly, if you could give us let's say half an coordinate the time with [PERSON-39]
Agent: But that would also really help. That would also help to understand what is architecture and how does it really work. Let's do that. Let's do that.
Agent: So we'll find some time with you on [PERSON-37] work with [PERSON-21] on it on the other detailed aspects.
EndUser: As we parallel
Agent: But just to clarify, once you have the pod from us, it is your instance of [ORG-1] and you know, could be, you know, and I want to say it's a lose example, because let's say use [ORG-40], there's certain things you can make in [ORG-40].
EndUser: Lose example you may use
Agent: So, that is the kind of architecture I am again using a very, very simplistic example. Maybe I should use example like iPhone.
Agent: You have iPhone developers who can make apps on iPhone, iPhone, there are certain standard capabilities which are there. But you will do a lot of work.
EndUser: Iphone will be a better example from a layman's standpoint. But then we will do a works of it for that.
EndUser: But it gives me a sense, gives me a sense, but detail is what I was thinking, it will really help.
Agent: Ah.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, we'll do that. Let's do that. And apparently we'll work with [PERSON-39]. Sure.
EndUser: Any other feedback that you have for us?
Agent: That's where I am broadly. So I understand principally what we are talking about, would want to
EndUser: See a bit more details for me to appreciate this better. Understand. And you mentioned there are two use cases for which you would like us to give an assessment of what it would take.
EndUser: And the details you can get. This is a pre-approval offer, which is a bit of a legend.
Agent: Is a pre-approval offer.
EndUser: This equivalent to eligibility
Agent: Check, right?
Agent: So what would it take to implement our version
Agent: Of pre-approved offer slash eligibility check?
Agent: And we can sort of move from that. It'll give, it'll educate us and give us a sense of how this will be done. Understand. So hi, this is [ORG-57].
Agent: Yes, I'm going to work with [PERSON-39] and So as the next step, [PERSON-39],
EndUser: Ankushya.
Agent: If you can do, if you can do us a favor, [ORG-46] folks, I did it because, you can do it the other way.
Agent: I would just say come if flowchart may But I assume with I suggest let's have a sink offline with [PERSON-21] and plan to meet in person if possible.
Agent: Share a conclusion.
Agent: You
EndUser: Know and we will work out the let's set up our next call and discuss those details of how to do it in that call.
EndUser: Yeah, I think I will do it in my hand as I will try to create a detailed Workflow of
Agent: Real global eligibility check, right?
Agent: And then we can ask that expression on call whenever we meet next, either on [ORG-50] meet or physical. Yeah, okay, makes sense. Makes sense.
Agent: Yeah, because I think the reason why I was saying so much than I'm sorry if I cut you off. No, no, no valid point valid point valid.
Agent: Yeah, now we need to really, you know, kind of go into the final level of details which are literally at the Implementation level, right?
Agent: So the, the compositions need
Agent: To be, you know, not just at the flowchart level, we should, you know, really trash things out as we go ahead.
Agent: Absolutely, I'm with you. Yeah, amazing. Okay. And apparently so many of you also need to take time with time with [PERSON-40] for the platform and so join that workshop.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah. And we should have [PERSON-23] too. And let's let's do that conversation as well and Of course.
Agent: We'll give us a view.
EndUser: He sounds good. So [PERSON-39], let's work on these two next steps here. Sure. In case, apparently share the presentation that presentation from [DATE-1] as well, we'll go through it and [PERSON-40] we'll do that.
Agent: Help as well. [PERCENT-1] All right, something Thank you so much
EndUser: But amazing.
Agent: For the time. Thank
Agent: You. Bye bye. Salesforce team.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So, I think fundamentally, when we look at [ORG-1] platform from a loan journey perspective, these are three pillars which we have seen, which we kind of working with the likes of even [ORG-11] or the [ORG-11] or the I think [ORG-10] or I would say [ORG-11]. I mean, in [GPE-4] top eight [ORG-18], they are using [ORG-1] for their loan products, which could be multiple variant, which could be there.""

The customer seemed more engaged after this question as it allowed them to understand the capabilities of the salesforce platform and how it can cater to multiple loan products.

2. ""So, the journey starts with which is a pre-application piece wherein you know there is somebody has shared a basic information which is the pan itself, but because you would need pan to identify or qualify a lead right once you have a pan you know there is a eligibility.""

This question sparked interest from the customer as it focused on the initial stages of the loan journey, specifically the sourcing process. The customer asked several follow-up questions, indicating their engagement with this topic.

3. ""So, I think just to give you a balance in terms of, I think one of the question was around scalability and the future, I can say that, the judge themselves started their journey, I think close to 11 years now. I think they've been, using [ORG-1] close to 4028 products. When I say product, it could be right from you r 2-wheeler loan to 4-wheeler to your personal loan since on so forth, right over drafting and everything else.""

The customer appeared more engaged after this question as it showcased the scalability and success of the salesforce platform, with a real-life example of a company that has been using it for over a decade.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The sales team mentions setting up a follow-up call and discussing details, but there is no confirmation or agreement from the customer on this point.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They were interested in understanding how the seller's product could be adapted to fit their specific needs and processes. They also expressed interest in setting up a follow-up call to discuss the details of the implementation.

Question: What are the concrete next steps agreed upon by the customer and the seller?

The concrete next steps agreed upon by the customer and the seller are:

1. The seller will share a presentation from a previous meeting.
2. The customer will review the presentation and prepare a detailed workflow of their current global eligibility check process.
3. The customer and seller will have a follow-up call to discuss the details of the implementation and how the seller's product can be adapted to fit the customer's specific needs and processes.
4. The customer will also participate in a workshop with the seller's platform team.

Question: Were there any mentions of competitors during the call?

There were no direct mentions of competitors during the call.

Question: Were there any blockers or issues mentioned that could prevent the deal from closing?

There were no explicit blockers or issues mentioned that could prevent the deal from closing. However, the customer did express a need to understand the implementation process and how the seller's product can be adapted to fit their specific needs and processes. The customer also mentioned the need to review the presentation and prepare a detailed workflow of their current global eligibility check process before the follow-up call. These steps suggest that the customer is taking a careful and considered approach to evaluating the seller's product and its fit for their needs.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They did, however, ask many questions about the product's capabilities and how it could be adapted to fit their specific use cases. The customer also expressed interest in seeing a more detailed demonstration of the product, which suggests that they are still evaluating whether it meets their needs.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current engagement with the seller's product in the international businesses. Specifically, clarifying the scope of the product usage for the different divisions and how they manage leads and opportunities.
2. The sales rep could have delved deeper into the customer's understanding of the seller's product as a one-stop shop, emphasizing the business value that the customer can drive from using the product in a holistic manner.
3. The sales rep could have explored more about the customer's future plans and how the seller's product can support those plans, including any specific features or functionalities the customer might require.
4. The sales rep could have asked about any pain points or challenges the customer is currently facing with their existing solutions, and how the seller's product can address those issues.
5. The sales rep could have inquired about the customer's decision-making process, timeline, and key stakeholders involved in the potential deal. This would help the sales rep to better understand the customer's needs and tailor their approach accordingly.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1. ""I am the account manager for Cast 30 and been handling Cast 28 as an account for [DATE-2]. I joined with my colleague [PERSON-2] who will be supporting us from [LAW-1] from the sales perspective and our colleagues [PERSON-1] who is our solution designer, senior solution designer and I believe [PERSON-3] has also joined who manages the solutioning for [LOC-1]. I think he would be joining or he must have joined. So what I'll do is, do you want us to just quickly run through what [ORG-1] is all about or have you ever? Worked on sales for the earlier because these slides though your you know peers would have seen these slides earlier But we'll just quickly glance through these slides""
2. ""So, though... you are using in fragmented think it's a good install base for us for [PERSON-8] default.""
3. ""I think fundamentally, when we look at [ORG-1] platform from a loan journey perspective, these are three pillars which we have seen, which we kind of working with the likes of even [ORG-11] or the [ORG-11] or the I think [ORG-10] or I would say [ORG-11].

5. ""And then there is an application process which gets started which you can say mortgage process. It could be setting the fundamentalists across different loan products this is the journey which is there of course the nuances will change.""
6. ""A person role will have different ones, a 2-wheeler will have a different ones and 4-wheeler, but highly these are the three pillars which happens.""
7. ""One is your pre-application.""
8. ""Second is your mortgage process, wherein the application have processing fraud check and all those things are taken care.""
9. ""Then the underwriting and post and then I think once the underwriting is done, the disbursement piece that's wherein the [ORG-1] preview ends, we typically the loan management is done on some other application. It could be a thin one or you know, let's suppose any existing ERP which you have wherein your loan management is done.""
10. ""And then post, you know, once you pass on to the loan management system. How you can enable your collections as well. Because a lot of customers face this issue as well that see, it's very easy to actually, I would say, give a loan. Right? There are a lot of people who are looking for loans, right? But getting the money back from the people, how you have to define those [DATE-9], how do you do those collections as well? Because there would be, you know, in terms of collections, of course, there is [PERSON-11] and all those, there is online basis as well. But there is sometimes you have to assign a field agent as well, right, to the collections as well and so on.""
11. ""So I think these are the three pillars. which kind of I think helps us to kind of give it a one platform for all our customers as well who are using [ORG-1]. Plus of course you know you have only channel in terms of the case resolution, you have contextual analytics and so forth but I think just to sum it up these are obviously three pillars which we have in place.""
12. ""I think moving on I'll hand it over to [PERSON-1] to run us through in terms of the demo as well or what exactly the key specifics are there in terms of our loan Thanks, thanks, [GPE-6].

video_19754_167_6qr3y000000sbIiAAI,"EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: Awesome. Well, we said this out [TIME-1] for [DATE-1]'s conversation.
Agent: I'll work to get, you know, get us out of here before 261 Pacific, but just you want to check if you all have a hard stop at that time.
Agent: Okay, let me go ahead and quickly share my stream.
Agent: [PERSON-1], would you like to introduce yourself while I do that?
Agent: I figured it'd be nice to, I got a chance to meet this whole group. Great people [DATE-2] and would love to obviously know introduce you [DATE-1].
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Well, it's great meeting everybody. Thanks for letting me join your call. I'm a solutions engineer at [ORG-1] and I help Support how land as well as our entire insurance organization.
Agent: And so I've gotten to know some of your counterparts and in different parts of [ORG-2] and [ORG-3].
Agent: I'm still looking forward to talking more with you all and how [ORG-1] can potentially help your business unit that you're working with. Thanks for having me and looking forward to it.
EndUser: Thanks to me too.
Agent: Awesome. Okay. Famous line.
Agent: Can you all see my screen?
Agent: Yes. Awesome. Okay. So to catch up, just a light agenda for a conversation [DATE-1]. We want to talk through just a high level summary of what we heard [DATE-2] and make sure we're starting off from the right track.
Agent: I'd shared my notes with [PERSON-1]. So she has an idea of what we're talking about
Agent: And so I want to make sure that we're aligned in terms of the challenges that we're working to solve, the benefits that might come from solving these challenges.
Agent: And then [PERSON-1]'s going to help us understand a little bit further on the actual processes themselves, what they look like and that way when we work with [PERSON-2], we can share with him some of the different pieces that we're going to be solving for.
Agent: And then at the end, you know, if it makes sense, I wanted to share wit h you a light outline.
Agent: And before I do hav e I think the three of you mentioned that the team's using happy [ORG-4] [DATE-1], primarily because the other team was using it.
Agent: But when we think about making technology decisions, have the three of you helped decide on technologies in the past or, you know, gone through evaluations before?
EndUser: I have.
Agent: I'm curious what kind of platform did you help implement?
EndUser: It was well, it was really [ORG-5] in my prior organization and I served as an organization prior to that.
EndUser: Also, I've gone through several demos in this company within our some initiatives that we had where we were vetting out [ORG-6] systems.
EndUser: I have not been a part of demos, but I was a part of developing these [ORG-1] piece that we currently use, platform for [ORG-7].
Agent: Helping develop the [ORG-1] instance that [PERSON-3]'s team uses [DATE-1], right?
EndUser: Was that the same one that you showed me or was that a different one?
EndUser: No, it was a different one. [PERSON-3]'s team only uses the [ORG-8] version of [ORG-1] where they use it for their incentives and for their sales piece.
EndUser: I use the covered [GPE-1] one, which is more of a Workflow where we, that's where we follow our Cases through our processing through those cues.
Agent: But it is, and I'm just asking for my own knowledge. That one's not.
Agent: Under your team's umbrella, right?
Agent: Is that the one that is owned by the actual cover [GPE-1] team?
Agent: So they asked your team, what do you guys need to see when we, you know, give you a system that's going to work?
Agent: Okay. I know there's different parts to the equation. Okay. Awesome.
Agent: And then [ORG-9], have you gone through anything like this before?
EndUser: Um, not officially. Uh, I've just been in the background in the shadows stuff. No worries. I ask because I at the end of this call, it'll help me just share
Agent: General approaches in terms of how do we think about [ORG-1]?
Agent: How can we potentially roll this out and helping a lot of our customers think through these decisions together?
Agent: It'll just be a good baseline for me, you know, kind of where I start in terms of the process.
Agent: So, and we're already on kind of the first couple of steps where we talk about, you know, the problems that we're trying to figure out and, you know, why this would make sense.
Agent: And so I'll make sure you go into more detail when we get to that step [DATE-1]. If it helps you, [PERSON-4] and [ORG-9] would be the people that I go to
EndUser: Test the limits of the system or break it.
Agent: That does have so good at that. I'm good at breaking things. Well, I'll tell you what [ORG-9], I'm just going to volunteer [PERSON-1], but she's up for the challenge.
Agent: So, you know, focus in there as [ORG-10] where, you know, what we're capable of, what we're not, and we'll do our best to see what we can do.
Agent: So, kind of a summary of our conversation [DATE-2]. You know, we talked a little bit about the need for a potential [PRODUCT-1] for the benefits and enrollment side of the house.
Agent: And so when we think about member eligibility, we talked about sales force to be able to come in to standardized best practices, be able to add workflows and, you know, add automation to some of the manual processes that we're handling [DATE-1].
Agent: Triage the conversations as Cases start to come in and then also centralized that participant data as it, you know, from the initial sales cycle, when insurance services team starts to sell it through the actual enrollment piece, when your team is starting to handle the Cases and manage that.
Agent: And a couple of the priorities that we need to [DATE-1] are going to be related to bein g hit the compliant and having the ability for encryption So we'll be understanding that process a little bit further .
Agent: Improving the intake process with automation we mentioned earlier, creating some standardized reporting and processes so we can start to understand a little bit more about how efficient we really are being [DATE-1].
Agent: And then some of the benefits that might come from that would be, you know, reducing the operational costs and then having that additional visibility. I'll pause here.
Agent: Was there, I know I asked, I've had this quite a bit [DATE-2], but was there anything I might have missed in terms of priorities?
EndUser: Those are the priorities for eligibility processing.
EndUser: They would be other things that would want to use it for. I would want to leverage the system for, but this is definitely the stepping stone for us.
EndUser: Yeah, and I was about to make the similar comment where our focus with this group is for eligibility and technically finance work cues, but we have other operational teams that would also.
EndUser: At later date be leveraging it, but I honestly feel like from a Workflow perspective, we would have the same overriding priorities as far as HIPAA compliant workflow, an efficient Workflow process and visibility.
Agent: J.d.
Agent: Did you mention, was that data was also another part of this?
Agent: Is that what you said?
Agent: Yeah, I mean, I'm I like data. Sorry.
Agent: Yeah, you said it was not the word that you said, or would you say something else was also priority?
EndUser: Um, yeah, I mean data analysis, you know, reporting to me, can I go hand in hand, but, um, you know, just.
EndUser: I, I'm right now I'm also trying to envision other parts of my team that are struggling as well, because they're not using, you know, having to use happy [ORG-4], they're using [PRODUCT-2].
EndUser: So, you know, how do [PERSON-5] how would I implement managing.
EndUser: Year, year over year, you know, tax compliance reporting for my team as well. So this is other things that that Workflow would look different than the eligibility Workflow that we mostly talked about [DATE-2].
EndUser: But, you know, the same, I would say similar goals and priorities like [PRODUCT-3] was saying. You know, HIPAA compliance is the big one. That's a necessity. You know, improving intake, you know, reducing costs.
EndUser: Those are all really standard things that we definitely need to focus on.
Agent: Okay, perfect. And then, you know, as we hop into, this is the last slide for right now, just to kind of confirm some of the challenges that we're going to dive into [DATE-1]. The challenges [DATE-1].
Agent: Sorry, there's the challenges to that we're looking at is just the lack of encryption and the compliance. It's available.
Agent: The lack of ability for reporting and automation and the workflows, all these things that we want to build that we don't have [DATE-1].
Agent: And then also that visibility, right?
Agent: You know, how, what does it look like when the customer goes from the initial sale and being able to take all that information that we have about the people, their attributes, their business and sharing that with the team.
Agent: That's actually managing enrollment so that we can provide just better visibility and kind of transactioning with those customers on an ongoing basis.
Agent: And then some of the impacts that had put together were, well, [DATE-1] we have a negative impact to the member experience because we don't have a centralized system in place.
Agent: You know, the costs for operations, it might not be super high [DATE-1], but as we start to think about scaling, this is something we talked about [DATE-2].
Agent: You know, are we going to hire more at that time, or are we thinking about, you know, streamline efficiency with a platforming with technology.
Agent: And I think one of the things you actually said [ORG-9] was there's one person per team to assign cases.
Agent: Is that I guess how many teams were there?
Agent: Because I remember we said that, but I didn't. Yeah, I think I may have asked the second question at that time, but.
Agent: Yeah, how many teams are there that are actually handling the cases?
EndUser: One person for three teams.
Agent: God, so it's that one person.
EndUser: It's one person for three teams for them. Is to highlight for that.
Agent: Nice, yeah. Cool. And then the final thing is just, you know, being able to put together best practices and then being able to streamline some of those operations. So kind of just a starting point for our conversation [DATE-1].
Agent: I guess, would you guys add or subtract anything from here and pause there?
EndUser: Yeah, you know, I think that's definitely a good starting point for her business impact. That's those are things we talked about [DATE-2].
Agent: Okay, perfect. Well, I think that pretty much gets me up to speed on the conversations.
Agent: It sounds like how in a new world are aligned on key challenges and business impact and completely understand that there's additional nuances and other business units that might long term utilize the [PRODUCT-1] and they would have slightly different challenges or business impacts.
Agent: So we won't force you to say just to these challenges and these business impacts, we can add and remove things as they pop up to the conversation.
Agent: But one thing that would be helpful for me to dive into a little bit deeper, I, um, high level went through the Recording from [DATE-2]'s call.
Agent: I mean, it sounds like one of the key things is going to be the managing of that member intake process and kind of going through the eligibility and all of the criteria and the workflows that come downstream from those intakes.
Agent: Um, so it's okay with you all. I would like to start with that process and just kind of, you know, start to finish from the submission coming in like we have.
Agent: That's coming in, whether it's through a portal or what have you And then we can just high level breeze through the various steps and peopl e that would be touching that because I'm sure when you when you have a read back or a demo, those are the points in the process, you're going t o want to make sure that the platform can handle seamlessly So just want to make sure I've got a good idea of what that process looks like .
Agent: So I guess we'll start with when somebody does make a submission to your team.
Agent: Where's that submission coming from?
EndUser: Coming from either other business email addresses or personal emails.
Agent: And it all comes through emails.
Agent: Is anything submitted through like an online custom report or anything like that?
Agent: No. All right, good deal.
Agent: And then these business and personal emails, what does that application look like?
Agent: Do you have a form or anything that they tend to grab from one of your other business units?
Agent: Or do they just kind of send you a message, hey, we're interested?
EndUser: Yeah, and we have, so for processing eligibility, we have an enrollment form when people want to enroll. We have lots of different requests that come in to a singular location.
EndUser: So, pretty much the entirety of our scope for our team will go through that box. So, that's handling entire census data to single forms, just the body of email text. Some of our...
EndUser: So... Part of the difficulties is the differentiating between the trust, the assurance trust and then [ORG-8]. So, you know, for example, [ORG-8], they don't use in any forms. They just add info to the body of the email.
EndUser: And our trust is more restricted to sending specific info for within specific forms to meet compliance purposes.
Agent: Okay. And then this might be a high level question, but I'm going to ask it.
Agent: What are these applications and submissions for?
Agent: Are they for like a benefits enrollment?
Agent: Yes. Okay. So benefits enrollment.
Agent: And is it a specific type of benefits enrollment or could it be any sort of like major [ORG-10] or is it specifically group or individual or aaaaken?
EndUser: It's mostly group or individual benefit enrollment through multiple types of benefits.
EndUser: And when you say multiple types of benefits, medical, dental, vision, pharmacy, whatever.
Agent: And then is there certain eligibility requirements that they meet?
Agent: So I'm assuming they send in the enrollment form or they send you, you know, an email. And then from there, I'm sure it gets routed into a queue of sorts.
Agent: And then do you go through an eligibility process at that point?
EndUser: Yeah, quickly touching on that, how emails are coming in though. We have several different email addresses that all right now currently funneled to the same place through a distribution list.
EndUser: And that distribution list is then sending to our help desk. in which causes issues in itself. So primary concern transitioning would be, can, you know, how can [ORG-1] handle
EndUser: Email addresses going into a single queue?
EndUser: And is that the structure that you want going forward?
EndUser: No, I would need eight cues, one for each email address.
EndUser: No.
EndUser: Why not?
EndUser: Because that's not how it works.
EndUser: Why would I want a different queue for different email addresses when they're for the same purpose?
EndUser: Because I can get metrics different differentiated by the entity.
EndUser: That the same entity. I have four different email addresses for [ORG-11] eligibility. I'm talking more specific on IT's backend. What you do not see with that IT handles on a distribution list.
Agent: And the good news is [ORG-1] can handle it whatever way you will decide to do from the business case standpoint. Really, it's just for my own personal knowledge as I'm working. So [PERSON-4]'s point, you know,
EndUser: Um, based on the email address, it would go into a specific queue and that would be multiple queues based on the entity and services provided.
Agent: All right, awesome. And then from the queue, once it's in a queue, however, we wanted to work that out.
Agent: Once it's in the queue, is it then there's an individual that hops in there, looks at the criteria of the email and then assigns it out to the appropriate teams.
EndUser: We want to categorize it whether what type of what type of request it is.
EndUser: Yes, that's what our eyes then we would assign it
EndUser: To the specialist and that would go into the role queue.
EndUser: Yeah, our our intake specialist. Um. Makes a conscious decision to put a item into a specific queue with a specific. categorization within that queue.
Agent: Okay and roughly how many of these requests do you think are coming in per day into this queue?
EndUser: Um a single queue probably like just 25 for for one queue you know 17 for another queue on average throughout [DATE-3] it can go up to 111 or so.
Agent: And are there certain types of [DATE-3] like during open enrollment where those cues are perfect?
Agent: All right, perfect.
Agent: All right, so then once it gets categorized and assigned out to the specialist and are the specialist broken down?
Agent: Based on whether it's like whether it's.
EndUser: Dental vision health is that kind of. It is not broken out that way now.
EndUser: There's
EndUser: Mostly round [PERSON-6]. That's we would need to be able to assign round [PERSON-6] and not be restricted to specific categories.
Agent: The category or specific user is just who's available, who's next in the queue. but also be valuable for somebody to be able to opt out of being in the queue, like if somebody's working longer. Okay, perfect.
Agent: I was going to say, we're definitely trying to understand the process [DATE-1], but also [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-4]. I don't know, I keep, we met with [ORG-9] [DATE-2].
Agent: So I keep, when I see the name, I'm sorry, [PERSON-4], excuse me. When we think about our current process, please feel free to also share with us what you'd like to see.
Agent: When we think about, you know, now that we potentially have the ability to build an automation, like what could we, what would be helpful?
Agent: Because I think that would be helpful too. I think [PERSON-4] said you obviously have experience with helping design a platform before [ORG-9]'s, this is for context for [PERSON-1].
Agent: [PERSON-8] is a little bit newer to [ORG-1], so just helping, you know, helping when we think about . how to solution the sharing with [ORG-9], you know, how things can work at [ORG-1] would be important.
Agent: That was part of our last call that we kind of left open-ended to be able to address [DATE-1].
Agent: Perfect. Yeah, awesome.
Agent: Well, I will be sure to let you know [ORG-9] and team, if anything, like those up red flags or something that the platform can't handle, but everything that we've walked through from the phone call [DATE-2], up into our call [DATE-1], everything is very, you know, it's very much what our platform can handle and very much in the realm of what CRMs are used to tackle.
Agent: So that should give you some peace of mind as we keep going through it.
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: And then once, you know, we've gone round [PERSON-6], we've assigned it to a specialist, then what does kind of [DATE-4] in the life of the specialist look like?
EndUser: I need to have the drop down of the different statuses, whether it was complete pending, pending missing information.
EndUser: I need for it to be able to send auto responses with the case number in it.
EndUser: I need for it to be able to, when they send attachments, then it doesn't have a limit that it will allow it to come in, because sometimes that's a problem. that tax by limit. Okay.
EndUser: And you know, roughly what the average size of those attachments are. That's [ORG-9]'s
[ORG-18]. Most of them are, you know, just a few megabytes. They're not anything crazy. It's just mostly PDFs or [PRODUCT-2] files that [PERSON-9] maybe a couple thousand rows of mostly non-formatted data. So it's they're not super crazy.
Agent: Okay, and are those [PRODUCT-2] files or those?
Agent: Would these be potentially like census records or anything like that?
Agent: Awesome. Okay.
EndUser: And [PERSON-10], you can get applications too.
EndUser: So PDFs and things like that. Yeah.
EndUser: So it would be great if it can give us like turnaround time status. And the reporting features. We put up what the SLAs are and then you guys provided on the reporting based upon the categories.
EndUser: Being able to set different SLAs based on not just what Q, but also what. Um, how, how they're categorized in the queue
EndUser: Based on the case reason and the sub reason.
Agent: And the SLAs are those internal SLAs that you all have kind of put in place for your teams or these SLAs that you're out there with your customers. [ORG-18].
EndUser: Okay. Sure. But there's both. But yeah, I was going to say both. It's fine. They're both.
EndUser: But the, um, do you, your SLAs I assume can be tracked based on [DATE-5]?
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: Yeah. That'd be great.
Agent: Okay. Awesome. So then once the specialist, like let's say they, you know, they have all the documentation that they need to move this particular. business forward or this customer forward.
Agent: Who does it go to next after that?
EndUser: It's.
EndUser: Go for it.
EndUser: Typically, if it is completed, they email out of sales force and they email the client that it's complete.
EndUser: If it was a clean submission, that's where the automated response would come in and they just close the case and the auto response is sent to the client without us having to do anything.
Agent: Perfect.
EndUser: Um, yeah. If they, if they don't, if it's not as simple open shut and, you know, can we have like, um, built in,
EndUser: To the tickets or cases?
Agent: Absolutely. So with the [ORG-1] platform, you can have an entire knowledge base.
Agent: And so as your specialist is working through it, let's say maybe it's a client they haven't worked with in the past or, you know, and they need some extra guidance, they could search anything that you have in your knowledge base that can help them as well too.
Agent: And then once you get deeper into yourselves for a journey and we start looking at some of our [PRODUCT-4] technologies, there's even some technologies out there that exist that based on the context of the case, some of those Knowledge Articles can be surfaced.
Agent: So all kinds of neat things we can start doing with the plot. But yes, the simple answer to your question is yes, absolutely. They can search them the knowledge bas e
EndUser: Can it identify or suggest knowledge-based articles based on the ticket information?
Agent: With some of our [PRODUCT-4] technologies, there are some ways where you could potentially do that with just out of the box without going into any of those capabilities.
Agent: You can also, you have the option to attach Knowledge Articles to the case. So let's say you're wanting to move it from one specialist to another based on maybe complexity increasing if that previous.
Agent: Specialist has attached a knowledge article, but they need help with a certain process that knowledge article guided them to.
Agent: You can also attach those so that way everybody has full visibility into kind of what's been referenced throughout the case.
Agent: Awesome. And then kind of the downstream, so we're getting the submission in for the benefits for the benefits enrollment.
Agent: So once all of this is completed and it goes out to the client, the auto email that it's completed, what is the internal process?
Agent: So when they go to enroll in the benefits, is this, are these benefits that you all are offering in house?
Agent: Or are you then having to go out to various carriers to actually set up those policies?
Agent: Or what does that process look like?
EndUser: And for AT, it's all we are the carrier for [ORG-8]. That is a more complicated questions.
Agent: Anybody want to tackle high level, the [ORG-8] side of that?
EndUser: So we have, so I can definitely say that there will there would be other administrators that we would need to. communicate with based on enrollment.
EndUser: So, when enrollment happens, being able to communicate with another carrier to update their system as well.
EndUser: For the most part, it's, you know, we, we administer those services, but there are outliers.
EndUser: So, [ORG-9], for an example.
EndUser: We would communicate with a [ORG-10] carrier, a dental carrier, a pharmacy carrier, and a vision carrier for one member. So I have an example for you.
EndUser: So one of the things that might come in is a corporate election form for a corporate participant that has a [ORG-18] enrollment. So I would take the enrollment form via the [ORG-1]. I would enroll them. in our system.
EndUser: And then I, from there, I have to email out of [ORG-1] with the information to [ORG-18] to say, hey, please enroll [PERSON-10] on your [ORG-18] plant. And then I would close my ticket as closed.
EndUser: And then the auto response would be sent to the client because I've accomplished all of my steps. via the [ORG-1] ticket.
Agent: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. And so on the AT side, it stays all in house with you all. And then on the pinnacle side, that's where it would maybe go out to a [ORG-18] or a various carrier.
Agent: So it'd be important to have a platform that can document all of that communication that you have with the carrier in case on the [ORG-18] side, whatever you've asked for them to complete, didn't get completed, you have records.
Agent: And I'm sure there's a bit of reporting and auditing that would be beneficial to be able to see which carriers you're working with the most or which ones maybe you're having issues. wit h Okay, good deal.
Agent: Right.
Agent: And then as, and I'm going to go back to the specialist side one more time, when they're gathering all of the requirements for these applications, is there a lot of email back and forth that goes on to, to acquire those documents?
Agent: And does it always stay with the same specialist, or are there times where like it's escalated up to managers or to more senior specialists?
Agent: Yes. Yes, 10 of you. Well, that's good. I mean, that's pretty typical in this space, but just wanted to make sure that we were showcasing that. Okay, great. Well, thank you all for diving through that process with me.
Agent: That gives me a good idea of kind of just the nuances and the workflows that you that are kind of top of mind, maybe the [ORG-18] priority of if you're moving off of Happy Fox.
Agent: Now, [DATE-1], this entire process is this end to end done on Happy [ORG-4] or their pieces of this that you're having to just will. into another system as well too .
EndUser: Yes, to the second one. So yeah, I mean, the main reason is because I have a foxy and handling encryption built in just off of the bat. So.
Agent: And so what we'll do is PHI. And so anything that has PHI [DATE-6] since it can't live in happy [ORG-4] on where you storing that information.
EndUser: In our system in our in our proprietary system or in our encrypted servers.
Agent: Was there, was that as that custom system?
Agent: Is that the [ORG-5] system that we talked about?
EndUser: No, that's our actual I was referencing our actual processing system that we that we use that we've maintained.
Agent: And is that a legacy system that was. Yes.
EndUser: It's a good word for it. Yes, it's a perfect word.
Agent: And then [ORG-5] was just to manage the cues then.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: All right, so then anything with the [ORG-17], we can just assume that that's in the proprietary system. That's in legacy.
Agent: So to your point and the conversation from [DATE-2] makes a lot of sense how much value you would get out of having an encrypted platform where you're not having the swivel chair back and forth to that proprietary system to check for documents or to check for statuses.
Agent: And because I'm sure sometimes what's going on in Happy [ORG-4] maybe isn't being mirrored in the legacy system and you guys see issues come up with that.
EndUser: Sometimes, probably not in the way you're thinking, but yeah. I mean, our main solution for that is just being able to email externally through the [PRODUCT-1]. So encrypted.
Agent: Okay, that makes sense. All right. So now I'm going to switch gears because I think you will walk me through. very well, the Workflow for the member intake process.
Agent: And I know we talked a lot about reporting and analytics on the call [DATE-2] and then on the intro to our call [DATE-1].
Agent: Do you have some specifics on kind of what you all are thinking would be like the reporting that's going to bring you the most value?
Agent: Like where are you lacking in your reporting?
EndUser: I need an aging report. I need a report that gives me how many Cases I received, how many Cases I closed, the average turnaround time for each case.
EndUser: I need a Productivity report, which normally I get that by combining different [ORG-1] reports.
Agent: Thank you, perfect.
EndUser: Any additional ones anyone else would wanna add?
EndUser: A dashboard report. the queue
EndUser: Overall. Yeah, you know, being able to see
EndUser: Stats and basically all the criteria that we've talked about already. For me, it's easier to list what we currently have than everything I wanted to do. So,
EndUser: Yeah, I'm kind of blanking right now because there's a lot. There's a lot more that I want to do with it. They haven't really had the opportunity to do so.
EndUser: And I don't have a lot of experience with [ORG-1], so for any.
Agent: Absolutely. And that's what we tend to see in these exercises too, [ORG-9]. We'll have these.
Agent: Conversations and usually as we're kind of doing our discovery on the current processes, you know, it does it does stay pretty similar to your current process and you know, there may be a couple of nice to have, but once we start showing you the software and you really start seeing how it works, that's really where we start seeing the light bulbs start to go on and people are like, okay, well, what if we utilize the platform to do [ORG-19] or, you know, I'll take some creative liberties while I'm putting together this Workflow and based on what I'm hearing you all tell me and based on what I see with all of our other insurance customers, and that are similar in processes that they've been able to utilize on the platform that's been valuable .
Agent: Always sprinkle those in .
Agent: I think as we keep going through this process , I think you'll start being able to think of some of those nice to haves or if you had a magic wand, you know, in an ideal world, what would you want the platform to look like?
Agent: I think some of those dots will start connecting.
EndUser: I would also like to see a client reporting so we can pull it by client and show all the open Cases within a client if a broker or account handler has a contact. Contact. Yeah, by the contact. Contact.
EndUser: Or a group of contacts?
EndUser: Yeah, by client and like or by group of contacts because I'm thinking of if our AMs are going out to one of our clients, we can pull the report that shows everything that's open for their clients so they they have a visual and so they're not blindsided by it.
EndUser: And then for us internally, being able to sort by the account manager and their group of clients. to show what's open in like a dashboard report of the number of Cases that are pending for their clients.
Agent: Okay, that sounds good.
Agent: So kind of like when a specialist logs in for [DATE-7], you know, being able to see like, like their entire work queues and maybe have that separated out by, you know, which, which applications maybe you're almost close to being completed.
Agent: They need one more item versus maybe an application that's missing several things. No, my ask was a higher level for the work queue itself. Yes. I see where you're going is for each member of [ORG-9]'s team.
Agent: You can see what's in their queue and the aging within it so that they should be attacking the oldest to the newest, but I was
EndUser: Doing a compilation out of the queue for what I present outside. Yeah.
Agent: Awesome. So kind of that one level up having the bird view and see what his entire team is doing and report on that higher level. Okay.
EndUser: All right. I see a hand raised. There's sales force have the capability.
EndUser: On the case screen where, for instance, if one of the fields is a group number, we plug in the group number and then there's a table where it'll auto populate like the account manager or the contact.
EndUser: We were to pre provide that field that we will be pre populated based on the group number.
Agent: That can be automated within the platform to accomplish that where you have certain group numbers tied to accounts or contracts or when certain shields.
EndUser: And So if we were to integrate this with WTRS, for example, that would not be us managing that list. That would be us managing that list that affects our cues.
EndUser: It's the way I'm envisioning it in order to create the case. It's like an index card and then you have the different fields where the intake person has to fill it in.
EndUser: We put in 3841, the AM field will automatically populate to [ORG-18]. That's what I'm thinking, a list that we provide to them. I'm thinking, I was thinking more, [ORG-26], I was in thinking WGIS.
EndUser: Well, I mean, that's a would be a nightmare for [ORG-26]. I don't want to manage that. That changes all the time. So, you know, that's what got me thinking about integrating with [PERSON-11] where.
EndUser: So they are integrating with them, then they can manage that list for us. Yeah.
EndUser: Um, but it should be doing anyways, but, um, yes. You know, so.
EndUser: So that, you know, and then I was thinking about, okay, well, hey, can, uh, how, how would an audit on this look if I would have one of my orders, uh, uh, audit and eligibility case and track performance and just different types of metrics.
EndUser: Can that be done within the case?
EndUser: And, um, so can I have different visibility on Cases based on the member or the, the person working in it?
Agent: Mm-hmm, absolutely. So one thing that I think is good to think about with [ORG-1] is anything that is housed within [ORG-1] is reportable, and you can then expose that on a dashboard.
Agent: So really any information you're capturing with the system, we just would foot different filters on your reports in order to pull that information.
Agent: And so kind of the answer will always be yes, if it's like, can I report on this?
Agent: If it lives in [ORG-1], you absolutely can pull a report on that data. And you can go as granular.
Agent: Down to the field level as you want, or you can keep it more high level and keep it mor e at your case levels or at your queue levels, but absolutely you can pull those reports .
Agent: That's one of my favorite parts of the platform is the analytics reporting capabilities where if it's in there, you can pull it.
EndUser: Yeah, you know, creating, why are they talking about creating Cases and, you know, someone would go and fill in specific information for that case.
EndUser: I'm wondering it to what degree can that be automated?
EndUser: So if I have a case that comes in that says, Hey, it's, it's an email subject line and they might include a five digit number in that.
EndUser: In that text subject, how well can I identify that?
EndUser: How can this link and I identify that number?
EndUser: I might have to have a little more context on that. I'm trying to just figure out how much automation can be done for the way that my clients are accustomed to communicating with us currently.
EndUser: [PERSON-10], can you share like a subject line on an email?
EndUser: What it would look like?
EndUser: Sure. You know, zero, zero, you know, one, you know, urgent. I, you know, enrollment, you know, this person.
EndUser: To what parts of that can I pull from to automate?
EndUser: If possible at all.
Agent: Yeah, so if it's just from the email itself, like the body of the email or there's text like that without having some sort of like OCR reading tool.
Agent: Yeah, you integrate any sort of OCR tool, like kind of like what you're talking about that can scan an email. I can map that to fields. Mm hmm. Now it wouldn't be an out of the box [ORG-1] capability.
Agent: We'd have to integrate with an OCR tool. Um, [ORG-1] [DATE-1] doesn't have any box.
EndUser: Can it be a what are the restrictions on what kind of tools does it have to have been historically integrated in this [ORG-1] before?
EndUser: Can I do it myself?
Agent: You could do it yourself.
EndUser: I would design my own OCR tool.
Agent: Job, so. The one I see the most is there's one that's produced by [ORG-17] that we see the most that's embedded within [ORG-1]. But [ORG-1] is an open technology platform, meaning that we only expose our APIs.
Agent: And so any other technology that exposes an API can easily integrate within the platform. If it's a legacy system or something that doesn't have an exposed API, we have a new soft technology that can help.
Agent: Expose an API, but it's your question. If it's modern technology, like modern day technology, you can pretty much plug into the system.
EndUser: Great.
Agent: And so as well as, you know, if there's third party systems, we see a lot in the insurance space for the third party databases.
Agent: Like for, you know, we see a lot in the [ORG-17] side for property data, where they'll integrate with like a [ORG-21] [PRODUCT-5] or some sort of property data site to feed in based on addresses put into the system.
Agent: So there are all kinds of neat things you can start doing downstream once you get your [PRODUCT-1] up and running.
Agent: And so I know we're getting up close to having [TIME-2] left in the call. So I'm going to kind of bring this [ORG-25] to a higher level.
Agent: I know I got us in the weeds walking through the process, but I'd love to spend some time.
Agent: And I think how I would probably enjoy this discussion as well is kind of talking through, you know, now I kind of have an understanding from a technology standpoint, like what it is you're going to need to see and need to accomplish.
Agent: And again, all of those things are things that the [ORG-1] platform can accomplish. But kind of when we talk higher level about, you know, what this means to the organization and what is going to.
Agent: Interesting and when we go to that next level up .
Agent: Can we talk through maybe some of the business value that you think that this will bring to the organization?
EndUser: Well, visibility across the business line. So for [PERSON-9] and I, operations, we oversee all of operations where my limited view is. Operations, training, finance, and eligibility teams where [PERSON-2] has numerous more. He's got the call center.
EndUser: He's got our claims team. He's got our provider maintenance team or our [ORG-25] team.
EndUser: So the visibility for him would be In really what I was talking about as far as the bird's eye view, he could sort by client, see everything across all of his business lines that's open by a client.
EndUser: He can also see it by AMs because frequently, you know, he's in the meetings with the sales team and with the account managers talking about, you know, our [ORG-26] is how are we delivering what our response time is that type of stuff so he if he could do it by Contract group he can he Contract on the group by AM and see everything they've submitted what the turnaround times are that type of reporting would be valuable to him.
EndUser: And of course, obviously the cost containment product, you know, more efficient processes, those are the things that really drive operations.
Agent: So the visibility because
EndUser: If a call comes through the call center, that case is entered and it could either that one case that came in as a call.
EndUser: Is going to touch on possibly three other departments before it makes its way to complete.
Agent: And to him being able to have that visibility because it from my understanding of the organization, everybody kind of works in their own individual silo, but there's overlap within those silos.
Agent: And so I'm sure like, as you continue to go upstream in the organization, you know, we've stayed really granular in the weeds on this process, but you know, [PERSON-2]'s probably not going to care too much about that.
Agent: He's going to want to know that level above and see that Interaction between those business units. And that's for some of those analytics and reporting are going to be valuable to him. Yes.
EndUser: Yo u And then are there any sort of KPIs for your team that he's measuring?
EndUser: So are, you know, is anybody watching those SLAs that you've put into play?
EndUser: Yeah, it's mostly productivity, you know, data.
EndUser: Okay. So like, yeah, we have turnaround times that we have, we're held to especially. So our SLAs volume,
EndUser: Things like that.
EndUser: And
Agent: In [DATE-1]'s current environment with the majority of that being done and happy [ORG-4].
Agent: Is there a little bit of, is there a limitation into his visibility into that or into your ability to kind of communicate where you're at with the SLAs or those KPIs?
EndUser: Um, I think, I think it's just more to add to, you know, how much time can be saved on, we're just one team eligibility that, you know, has a potential use sales force.
EndUser: And for us, you know, I'm looking at, you know, one, one, you know, a whole intake specialist, how much can I, can I automate on his part so I can use him for other things, uh, you know, and to your question I mean.. .
EndUser: [PERSON-18], I just spaced out.
EndUser: I can only get one report on an option act. So any other reporting, which is most of it is manual, manually modified and updated.
EndUser: So talking about saving time, those are my more seasoned people or the people with higher value that I'm using their time to create manual reporting for. for [PERSON-2].
EndUser: So for cost containment purposes, those are the things that I'm looking at for just my team. Small part of [PERSON-2]'s overall team.
EndUser: And that would be a multiplier across all of his teams would be doing the same thing where they're having someone pull these reports. So obviously we report to him on a [DATE-8] and [DATE-9] basis.
EndUser: We also do the executive summaries for our board of trustees. And those are all manual reporting that we pull.
Agent: Mm-hmm. Yeah, so the operational efficiencies you'd gain from that would just be tenfold across all the different arms. Okay. And to be consistent, that's one of the other things is you have all these individual departments pulling manual reports.
EndUser: So we're all putting together spreadsheets that aren't formatted the same. So he's getting a variety of deliverables.
Agent: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I'm sure just being able to audit them for our accuracy, there's no real way for him to put those guardrails on place either.
Agent: And then I'm sure just from operational standpoint of just, you know, if you all are asking for additional headcount or any of that, I'm sure I'm sure it's tough to create those business justifications with the current model.
EndUser: Oh, you just said it time study would be under reporting as well.
Agent: And [PRODUCT-3], I think you mentioned last time, you know, [PERSON-2] was almost was it was it was he pushing your team to find a way to be able to kind of get the get the cues and the information out of happy [ORG-4] and kind of into a single system.
EndUser: [PERSON-2] was pushing for us to find a system or to launch a system that gave him visibility. Happy [ORG-4] was what we used at the time because we had it in house already, but it's not
Agent: It's not so easy to say. It's not so easy to say. It's not so easy to say.
Agent: He wants, he wants to be able to know what's happening in his business so you can make decisions as a business leader. Okay.
Agent: I mean, it makes sense, but it's helpful to hear it from your team in terms of like what, you know, where we think that he actually, where we think it would actually move the needle when we actually bring this to him.
Agent: Yeah. And so that kind of brings me to my next, uh, my piece here, which was, let's see if I can share my screen.
Agent: We talked about kind of, we talked about being A couple of us have ran through evaluations and helped kind of design systems.
Agent: But when we think about actually rolling something out, this is just a light mutual evaluation plan that I aligned with my customers on.
Agent: And [DATE-1] we're at a place where we've gone through our initial conversation to understand the problems and the challenges.
Agent: [PERSON-1]'s gotten a chance to understand what we can showcase when we go to actually validate the solution in terms of, you know, does it work?
Agent: And does it meet some of our needs and how customizable is. it.
Agent: And so our next step, I'd love to set up some time for us to be able to showcase to your tea m what we can put together.
Agent: That product is something that [PERSON-1] would be spending time to customize to take the information and learnings that we have [DATE-1] and apply that to her demo environment .
Agent: And so if that's something that we feel meets the needs, then I think we'd be ready to actually present the stadium and get his buy-in, understand.
Agent: How you want, how you heal, build the business case together with us to be able to get by and from [PERSON-18] to actually sign up on this.
Agent: And so if it's something that when we think about actually rolling this out, we would need to actually think about We can, sure we can tack on all of the, you know, I can turn on a hundred licenses for you all in the intern services or, and you can have access [DATE-1].
Agent: You know, I've been from access to the information that, you know, the system, everything, but then somebody needs to go in and set up the customizations to customize it to your team's use Cases and purposes.
Agent: And we have to determine what we'd be doing that in house.
Agent: You know, I know [PERSON-18], I've worked with him before and he's really sharp and other people on the team have told me the guy can figure out anything.
Agent: But does he have to bandwidth?
Agent: And if he doesn't have the bandwidth, you know, we have, he didn't really even know SI stands for, but Implementation partners and consultants that we work with who can becom e they'll scope the work.
Agent: We can, we don't have to make you guys, you know, start over from scratch, but they'll be able to understand exactly the processes that we want to build the workflows that we talked about, the cues, the triaging, and they'll be able to take that .
Agent: Put together a statement of work in terms of here are all things your team is asked for and this is the typical cost associated with them based on [TIME-3] that it takes to complete that project.
Agent: And then we'll have a potential cost for sales force but also for implementation. So pausing there. Have we thought about who would actually build the customizations [DATE-1].
EndUser: I have an idea as far as internally. What I have seen, like you said, we've had challenges when we have an in-house person doing all of it. It's much better if we have a Support for it.
EndUser: However, I will also say that [ORG-9] is the one who did do the Implementation of our happy [ORG-4] and really he's the one who identified all the weaknesses with it, when it's been running in here for [DATE-10] that was identified.
EndUser: So. Um, I have people this. But it's a band. It could be a bandwidth issue.
EndUser: So did you guys bring it on [DATE-10]?
EndUser: It's been, yeah, it's been literally [DATE-11]. Yeah.
EndUser: And across all of [PERSON-2]'s departments.
EndUser: So eligibility was the last. And outs, and outside of [PERSON-2]'s scope as well. So.
Agent: Let me ask you this.
Agent: Do we, because we're, you know, this is an interesting scenario where we're also working with that [ORG-8] team for a similar use case, obviously the customizations and workflows are a little bit different, but does [PERSON-2] work with that team as well?
Agent: Are you referring to the CCPU team?
Agent: Correct.
EndUser: They are a separate line of business. [PERSON-18] is their VP. So she would be [PERSON-2]'s counterpart on that side. They were they are a new team. So they were in Happy [ORG-4] because they launched with us.
EndUser: So [PERSON-2], me, [PERSON-4], we were part of their launch of [ORG-33].
Agent: Got it. OK, that was helpful.
Agent: Okay, I think where we stand here, let's set up the time for the dry run. You know, we can, it'll be this team [DATE-1] and we can talk and we can showcase to your team what we put together.
Agent: And then from there, we can set up time to determine, hey, did we feel like this is something that we can bring to [PERSON-2] or not?
Agent: And then from there, we can talk about the steps because, you know, cost for the scoping of work, those are, you know, people [TIME-4] that would, you know, require time and services and we'd have to scope that out and it would add a few steps here.
EndUser: I realized timeline is something we never really talked about.
EndUser: Was there a timeline we wanted this kind of up and running?
EndUser: We never want anything going live after [DATE-9] because we are then in peak season. So our window of opportunity is [DATE-18] through [DATE-18]. Oh, [DATE-18].
Agent: [DATE-18] to Go Live and test out platforms. And so obviously the end is not the best. If we can get it somewhere [DATE-18] to be like up and running, that'd be fantastic.
Agent: And then obviously before that, we need time to implement it and actually get things successful.
Agent: Okay, let's see. [PERSON-1] would be doing the build. She's doing a similar build for our friends over on the pinnacle side of the house, which we're actually showcasing.
EndUser: You're saying [ORG-26] is it we're all. I think I'm pinnacle. Yeah. Yeah. I think he's more [ORG-8] than they are. The clinical claims TPA. Let's, uh, we'll go for [ORG-33].
EndUser: First CCPU. [ORG-33], that would be nice. I would like to be applying the wall to see what kind of requests they were asking. Yeah. You were asking for. Yeah.
Agent: It seems like a very similar like if you go from a bird's eye view of being there's a submission, you walk through the triaging of that through the various work queues, you know, then you have a specialist that's working at gathering all the documentation before like, you know, basically green lighting and being completed.
Agent: So very similar, just at a high level.
Agent: So do you all think that that, because again, you know, we're trying to expedite your process because it sounds like you definitely want to have something up and running by [DATE-9] if you choose to implement a new system Do you think that demo, since they're very similar would be kind of, we can rinse and repeat the same thin g for you all, maybe tweak a couple thing s for when we show it to [PERSON-2] .
Agent: Um, I would say yes, but I would,
EndUser: I would caution you that our side of the business is the bigger side of the business. So you would be, it would behoove you to cater it to our side of the business.
Agent: We are the most knowledgeable side of the business, not to give us Twitter on horn, but we are. Yeah, that's right. Just say with place. No, I'm going to use your word.
Agent: We are the legacy side of the business. Okay. That's very valuable information for us to know too internally over here.
Agent: And so. Go
EndUser: Ahead. I was just going to say that, you know, we've talked a lot about just the eligibility portion, and that's what our bread and butter is.
EndUser: Personally, I also have other things that over time, I'm over seat that I would like to transition to a serum as well. that aren't just eligibility cues. So more things I wanna do with it. Yeah.
Agent: Based on the questions that you've personally asked and the way that you've approached thinking about [ORG-1], I feel like if we actually rolled this out, you would one day become an admin. Just just.
Agent: Not [PERCENT-1] like to be the admin for it. I'm currently that for. I was connect.
EndUser: You know, for me, for me, you know, manage, you know, I.
EndUser: Hey, let's track these Cases to me isn't justification to buy sales force. I could do that right now with Happy [PERSON-17].
EndUser: I do without Happy [PERSON-17] and I can coordinate all of my systems together, you know, and send data to each other if I wanted to. I want it to be easier.
EndUser: But I'm looking for me specifically, I'm looking for ways to improve communication across [PERSON-2]'s team as well. There are a lot of interconnected pieces and workflows that are directly tied to each other.
EndUser: I have to send things to claims.
EndUser: When I do my eligibility piece, you know, so, you know, we're... And finance, right?
EndUser: But on a [DATE-17] basis, I'm, you know, coordinating benefits for claims. So, you know, I answer ticket. I'm great. I'm... We'll make another ticket and give it a claims. you know, right now in Happy [PERSON-17].
EndUser: So there's those pieces still again, just eligibility side. But those are the examples of things that we can improve and also report on. I think better in the [ORG-1].
EndUser: But also, yeah, I'm just looking for a way to manage information and communication through [PERSON-2]'s teams overall.
EndUser: I'm jumping on you, [PERSON-4], because one thing, because you are also doing a demo for [ORG-33]. It was the who of you to know that when [ORG-21] was behind, it's our team that supports them.
EndUser: So we're also looking for a [PRODUCT-1] that we don't have to all of a sudden get access to help another team. Or cross train or train on the whole new [PRODUCT-1]. Yeah.
EndUser: That would be very valuable for you all. The sales force have a limit on the number. Currently, we call them tears because that's the way you guys built it.
EndUser: So to [GPE-1], [GPE-1], so I'm not sure if that's what your lingo is, but is there a limit on the number of tears and a limit on the number of cues that [ORG-1] can have?
Agent: I'm sure in some capacity, there is a limit. I don't know that number up the top of my head, but it's not going to be a small limit.
EndUser: If that answers the question, it's going to be a large limit. And I would be shocked if we hit those limitations with these use cases. But I can give back to you on what that official limited is.
EndUser: I'm just curious, because in the example from [ORG-9], if I have an eligibility case, I need to transfer it over to claims.
EndUser: I'm going to flip that case over to the claims queue so they can assign it to somebody so that it can be looked at. And they're going to flip it back. And the same thing with.
EndUser: If I have to send something to the sales, I'm going to flip it over to their queue and then vice versa so that it stays all within.
EndUser: And outside of [PERSON-2], but under [PERSON-18], you know, health management is also in happy [ORG-4], you know, so that that's something that goes through another one of our VPs up to [PERSON-18] and they're facing the same problems we are.
EndUser: So that may be another opportunity for you guys.
Agent: Who leads that team?
EndUser: That's [PERSON-19]. That's interesting. I don't know if we've heard about that type or that side of the house just yet. Probably not. But, you know, I mean, yeah,
Agent: They got on Happy [ORG-4] for everybody who made that decision.
EndUser: I don't know. I just know that we have a mystery. It's a one day. We were doing just fine. [DATE-19] we got stuck with Happy Fox.
Agent: So then at least in my perspective, so. I got you. So here's what I propose is our next step. You know, I initially have your demo drive run with your team.
Agent: [PERSON-8], if you wanted us to take a look at the bigger project, we can still approach this from a phased approach.
Agent: But if you wanted to set up time to explore it, be able to then when it comes time to actually show you talk with leadership and say, [DATE-1], just like you said, we can handle claims.
Agent: This will be a more effective way to manage the claims and the players will use your ability, but in the future, we can actually be able to handle these additional things I don't know if we've actually said exactly what they are, but I know there's additiona l areas we can help with that might help us build our business value to actually get thi s project and get the body in there Yeah
EndUser: So why I'm bringing it up so, you know, I was really finance So finance communicates externally with vendors and account management team heavily and accounting .
EndUser: They send things internally to account managers counting and also externally sometime s. Yeah, health management almost exclusively to member [PERSON-18] again, that's outside of [PERSON-2]'s scop e. But there's,
EndUser: We have reporting team handling things in Happy [ORG-4]. We had that again outside of [PERSON-26] reports to [PERSON-18]. We have who else I'm missing someone besides [ORG-17].
EndUser: And provider maintenance. There
EndUser: You go.
EndUser: That's helpful. If you prime is all [PERSON-18].
EndUser: Yeah, you know, and then. To me integration, I don't know. I don't I haven't had a conversation with them about it, but you know.
EndUser: If I can build a proposal that not only includes our eyes side, but also includes our [ORG-8] side for account management sales. I mean, to me that a college team. that dramatically increases my use case for [ORG-1].
EndUser: Cause then I have both sides of the house. Yeah. Um, under one, one roof, so to say, I will say in my mind, I feel like [PERSON-17]'s team has been grouped a little bit with the,
Agent: I guess you guys, I'm probably going to say another team you're going to say that's actually us, which is the membership team. that uses Fontiva [DATE-1].
Agent: And so I, my understanding was that there was this overlap of the membership users and the potential customers based
EndUser: That [PERSON-17]'s team would sell with. That's a different team. Just the membership team is under the trust. Yeah.
EndUser: Um, [PERSON-17], well, it's probably working with them because, you know, we're, we're very, uh, I don't know what's a good codependent, I guess, is a word.
EndUser: But, you know, on both sides of the business, [PERSON-17] was probably working with, but for the membership team, I don't think they're gigantic or anything, but they handle it.
EndUser: I mean, it's in the name and they handle our membership services for the trust, for the association, I should say, not just the trust, but for the association. which is the overall arch overarching umbrella over at [ORG-25].
Agent: Yeah, and that team uses that platform built on top of [ORG-1] platform [DATE-1], the [ORG-25] platform.
Agent: And we've talked to them about that earlier or towards [DATE-18] and then hoping to kind of restart that conversation because we have a team that we think we can Help with some of the bugs there.
EndUser: So, you know, for me, just right off the bat, I mean, I have to report to membership [DATE-26] because under the trust, I have, I have some people.
EndUser: So, you know, the assurance trust, they have to be a member to be a part of the trust. So I, but not everyone as a member has to be a part of the trust.
EndUser: So they have people that they manage billing for from a finance perspective, from a accounts receivable perspective. And then our accounts receivable team, our finance team, they only, they can't see everything. Right.
EndUser: So having that increased communication visibility, interdepartmentally, being one of managed accounts receivable, for example, for the ment for membership would be one thing. Yeah, just another thing.
Agent: That's huge. There's so many different things. That's why when I [DATE-17], when I started working with your team, I was like, wow, there's a different departments. There's so many different use cases.
EndUser: And they all sound very similar. They sound very similar. He put that correctly. [ORG-25], you must be a member of the [ORG-41] to be a member of the trust.
EndUser: Yeah. However, not all members of the association are a part of the trust.
Agent: That's fair. That makes sense. And then being a part of the trust means that they are they are mostly receiving health benefits through the trust.
EndUser: As part of the trust, as you benefits. Yeah, I mean, if you want technical term, it's a multiple employer welfare arrangement. Yeah.
EndUser: Um, but the, yeah, but the, um, but membership right that that's not on the health insurance side. That's not an insurance services side. That's. The whole different, the whole different thing.
Agent: [DATE-17], I talked to the [DATE-21] about that. And that's the first time I heard the term me.
Agent: Why?
Agent: So that rings a bell. Yeah. I appreciate all this context. Let's do this.
Agent: I mean, I guess our next step, let's rather than doing a demo, actually, it sounds like there's a little bit more that you guys, if you would like to share with us and show us, you know, kind of how things work [DATE-1] and that, and then we can try and build a bigger business case.
Agent: Obviously still potentially rolling this out in phases when we actually get to that point, but it'll allow us to capture kind of the breadth of what we can help with here at salesforce.
EndUser: So we're kind of dead in the water for [DATE-25]. [ORG-34]. This is his [DATE-25] before he leaves on vacation and immediately upon his return [PERSON-4] leaves. Lots of vacations and fun happening over there.
EndUser: Our peak season just ended. You've got to go over cover. Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: What would be your possible turnaround time for the dry run as you put together?
Agent: Yeah, so I think what might be valuable to sort of step before that and do what we like to call just a reverse demo, where you all kind of show us what it looks like in Happy [ORG-4] and all those various processes.
Agent: Because one thing like how one and I want to do before we get in front of [PERSON-2] is make sure that they're actually looking at this from more of a high level holistic business processes and not just keeping it siloed to that, that intake.
Agent: Um, because I think one of you mentioned earlier, you know, that's not going to resonate with him. He's going to be like, you can do that in Happy Fox.
Agent: And so I think it'd be valuable for us and we can do this as quick as you all can show it to us And that would also give us a better idea of, you know, how wide we need to go with the demo or what we need to show And then usually once we have all that information, usually within about, we can have [DATE-26] we can turn around a dry run .
EndUser: I can make that happen for you [DATE-33]. That way while we're on vacation, you're working on the demo and then we get to see it will come back. That's perfect.
EndUser: That way we don't lose [DATE-21] of time while everybody's kind of.
Agent: Kind of in motion over there and taking their much well deserved vacations. So let's see here.
Agent: Let's see what our schedules look like [DATE-33] and what time zone are you in?
Agent: So we're all in the same time zone. How then we're just down in, they're just down in [GPE-2].
Agent: And looking at your calendar, which is busier than mine, I think first thing in the mornings, a window that you and I both have, unless you have other times that are more building blocks literally.
Agent: I can move around my [TIME-5] call if that works for everyone, or I can do after [TIME-6]. I'm not like wanting to do things [DATE-17] after [TIME-7]. So let us know what works on your head.
Agent: I can either do from nine two 10 or I could do from one two two.
Agent: What are you doing at eight?
Agent: At eight. I can do eight.
Agent: [TIME-8]. It is perfect. [TIME-9] works for me.
EndUser: Perfect. And you just need someone to walk you through our correct ops connect process of how they intake it. Correct.
Agent: Yes, yep, the ops intake would be valuable.
Agent: And then any other process, you know, we're talking about all of these, like the claims on behalf of finance, if you have any of that you can show us just at a high level, how it would all report in that be helpful.
EndUser: I'm, I'll be gone. I don't know if anyone could do that for you. I'll be gone [DATE-33], unfortunately. So.
EndUser: I can show you the basics. I can have someone show you the basics because I think that's our first phase one. getting eligibility and getting that through the process and then we can build upon that.
EndUser: You want to use like [PERSON-17] with you or?
EndUser: I was going to use [GPE-3]. I don't want to impose on my [DATE-17] work for since I'm up on myself. Okay.
Agent: All right, perfect. Well, thank you so much for turning that around quickly and be willing to do that first thing in the morning on a [DATE-17].
Agent: Appreciate that and And thanks for all the time that you all have given us so far.
EndUser: No problem.
Agent: We'll see you guys all [DATE-33] morning at [TIME-10]. I'll send it out now. And if there's anybody like two forward it to, please feel free to add them to the calendar invite.
Agent: Sure. Great.
EndUser: [PERSON-8], have a great vacation and we'll see you when you get the clock. Thank you. I appreciate it. All right.
EndUser: Oh, does everybody have access to [ORG-9]'s calendar so we can calendar to that when she gets back or we should be dating now?
EndUser: They do. Yeah, they do. Okay. You can see it.
Agent: [DATE-25] then. All right, thanks everybody.

1.

video_19755_167_6qr3y000000saD5AAI,"Agent: All right, and everyone see my screen to kick Perfect.
EndUser: Us off.
Agent: So there's a lot that we talked about on our last call.
Agent: I am going to try to get to all of it [DATE-1] with a little bit of a story about, you know, a day in the life of an advisor in [ORG-1].
Agent: I will try to call out exactly what is, came out of the box and what I may have added to the page.
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: Definitely feel free to jump in with any questions that you have. I definitely want to keep this conversational as we go. Okay, Cool.
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: Okay. We're going to start off a day in the life of our advisor here, [PERSON-1]. This is her homepage. The bulk of this homepage is out of the box. Coming, templated with [ORG-1] for advisors.
Agent: This is essentially where she's going to start her day, but also how she's going to start to kind of identify exactly what her priorities are for [DATE-2], right?
Agent: She might want to start by checking out this dashboard. Again, this is one that comes pretty nicely out of the box. That is tailored for advisors. We really did do interviews with advisors.
Agent: We wanted to make sure that we understand exactly what does, like, impact their day-to-day, what metrics they need to keep track of, what kind of KPIs they're being held to.
Agent: So of course, it is editable, like a lot of other stuff here. But hopefully this is a really good starting place for you.
Agent: The reason that [PERSON-1] is seeing this is because she is an advisor, and she has the role of an advisor within [ORG-1].
Agent: So if you have other roles that start to filter in, as you get more diversified, as you grow, if there's a manager role or even different types of assistance and things like that, We can have different views for different people.
Agent: You can see the dashboard not only rolls up how she has been tracking to all of her goals But these are actually live dashboards as well as I roll over them.
Agent: You can see I can kind of jump in As long as I have the permission to view the file Behind this I can go ahead and jump straight into it into the file itself and see the data points that make that up And I can refresh it as often as I need to this does update any time we add a file at a contact You know, they're bank information.
EndUser: This
Agent: I just want to say hello to [PERSON-2]. Hi, [PERSON-2].
EndUser: Oh, there he is.
Agent: Hi, [PERSON-2]. Hey,
Speaker 5: How are you?
Agent: Welcome. Hey, [PERSON-2], how's
EndUser: It going?
EndUser: Good,
Speaker 5: Good.
Agent: Welcome to the party. Thank
EndUser: You.
Speaker 5: Thank you. I'm trapped over here, so I'm
Agent: Here to listen. No, I'm good.
EndUser: They said this will be Recorded to [PERSON-2] so we can always view it again offline.
Agent: We've just started here on the home page of an advisor. So the first place we log in [TIME-1]. They have a really nice dashboard of all these metrics.
Agent: They also have a really clear way to kind of prioritize their day. So you can see here there is a calendar. This is something that I have added. It's in the
Agent: App exchange. So something you can easily download for free and pop into your screen. But it helps me kind of visualize all of those different events and tasks that are coming up on my calendar a little bit better.
Agent: These pieces are out of the box. Something we also talked about is how much you folks use things like Outlook and Calendly to keep track of all of your different pieces of information.
Agent: This is actually the first place where you'll see our native Integration with Outlook. We have the ability to surface up all of your calendar within the system.
Agent: If we book something in [ORG-1], we can have it update your calendar as well. And this applies to email too. So I'll show you that in a little bit.
Agent: Any dates, events that you need to keep track of, I have an example of birthdays and upcoming RMDs here. Those are all things that you can kind of set up to be tracked within this dashboard as well.
Agent: So first thing that [PERSON-1]'s gonna do is she's gonna actually jump into her leads for [DATE-3]. She knows she's got some new leads coming in and she wants to take a look at those.
Agent: So we're gonna jump into our leads view. This is an example of a list view within [ORG-1]. This is very similar to an [PRODUCT-1] document from [ORG-2].
Agent: So it can be a nice way for new folks to come up to speed. It's a little less high-tech. It's a nice little stepping stone for those people who are just becoming more technological.
Agent: But this is a really nice way for us to be able to break down this large list of potential leads that might be coming in into various groups.
Agent: So you can go ahead and filter by any of the fields that are on those leads. And we can build these kind of preset views. So open referrals that I'm been assigned might be like onboarding prospects.
Agent: It's very easy for me to switch between those views and see those different lists and kind of filter down.
Agent: I have a couple hero records of folks that I've built out really well within the system that I like to kind of showcase as I'm doing these demos. And that's kind of where we're going to start.
Agent: This is a referral that came in. This might be something that [PERSON-1] inputted herself, or that you might have a lead form, some sort of website form. [ORG-1] can help with that as well.
Agent: So we have the ability to build any type of lead form to host it on your website to give you the Code to put it into your website builder.
Agent: And essentially what that enables you to do is to have these leads coming in directly to [ORG-1] with no re-typing happening. And that's
EndUser: Real quick. Now, if I can jump in, keep the conversation going. That is a form that's lead forms that can be built in [ORG-1].
EndUser: Because I know there's plenty of them that can be integrated easily, but you're saying that we actually might have the opportunity to use forms within [ORG-1].
Agent: Yes, so we have a forms builder within [ORG-1].
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: That allows you to expose it via a link or even, you know, as a little
EndUser: Html Code on the website. Okay. Cool.
Agent: And you can brand that you can collect whether fields are relevant to you.
EndUser: And is that coming out of the box with [ORG-3] cloud?
Agent: Okay, build the lead form.
EndUser: Awesome. It's not to Probably.
Agent: But the functionality does refer to it as web to lead.
EndUser: It come in. We Got it.
Agent: Perfect. So yeah, the benefit of that you just kind of outlined is that there is no Integration necessary. So it's a really nice little piece that you can expose very easily and have data flowing and cleanly into [ORG-1].
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: Cool. A couple things I'll point out about Mr. [PERSON-3] here. It's very easy for [PERSON-1] to see the important information.
Agent: A lot of what I'll show you [DATE-1] is our standard out of the box, how the data would be sorted for you.
Agent: But just keep in mind that if you found that the referral information was more important, if you wanted to collect an extra field, it's actually really simple to set those types of changes up collect more or less data as needed.
EndUser: And to
Agent: Something you'll also start to see is that there's a lot of like associated things. So there's an account that's associated to this. There's an opportunity that might be associated.
Agent: This is a pretty rich lead that's come in so far. There's also this ability to track all sorts of different things.
Agent: So, you know, as a part of my Outreach process, it's probably important that I call [PERSON-4] or that I reach out to him.
Agent: The email, make that initial point of contact, right?
Agent: These types of actions can be baked into the system. So this is another place where we're kind of seeing that.
Agent: Outlook Integration with [ORG-1] inbox that allows us to do things like, of course, email directly from my own email. So this is gonna be my email in this case.
Agent: But it also allows you to use things like templates, like time for a call [DATE-4]. that have all sorts of formatting and branding, merge fields that are already in here.
Agent: So I don't have to make sure that I'm typing in the right name or the right field. And it also allows you to put in things like meeting availability. So this could potentially replace your calendly needs.
Agent: It would pull these types of resources right from your Outlook calendar and allow you to place it right within the system.
Agent: Cool. There is also the ability to do that same thing from Outlook.
Agent: So depending on how it all balances out at [DATE-5], where you're spending the most time, is it your Outlook email or is it [ORG-1]?
Agent: Obviously, we would prefer that it be [ORG-1]. But this is kind of what it would look like if you were in Outlook. I have a little Recording here because I have [ORG-4] personally.
Agent: But you can see that this is [ORG-1] sidebar that both gives you information about the people that you're emailing and allows you to log emails, create contacts straight from Outlook itself.
EndUser: It's awesome. Very helpful.
Agent: Right. Any questions so far as we move through.
EndUser: No questions.
Agent: Okay. We typically see that there is kind of a lead process associated with a lead as there might be like a sales process associated with an opportunity.
Agent: So this is a really nice way to onboard people quickly to have consistency in your data is to be building these kind of step by step guidances.
Agent: You might be building in mandatory fields for every particular step that you're moving through. But the goal is, of course, to convert it.
Agent: At [DATE-5] and to convert it into an opportunity and an account that you can nurture on an ongoing basis. Once you can go ahead and get that referred.
Agent: Perfect. This is where we really get to the fun stuff. Once we convert that, you know, there's going to be a variety of objects that are created.
Agent: And this is where it kind of gets a little bit richer in [ORG-3] cloud than maybe a sales force that you might have seen before.
Agent: When we convert someone, I'm gonna switch over into [PERSON-5], who's an account. There's a lot more specialized objects built into here for advisors. to really make sure that you can have valuable conversations.
Agent: They can be keeping track of their interests and their life events, things that actually make them human.
Agent: So you can be a friend and a true advisor to them and not just someone that they talk to twice a year. So again, all of this comes out of the box.
Agent: This is kind of the customization from a Sales Cloud is that these types of objects don't exist. You could probably build them. They wouldn't look quite as nice. But there's a lot of like prefab stuff in here.
EndUser: So like for financial services, you're saying specifically.
Agent: Yeah, for this advisor, [ORG-5]
EndUser: Supervisors.
Agent: So there's this really nice roll up quick view of [PERSON-6] calls you, you know, exactly what the high level beats are.
Agent: But if you have time to prepare for something, say you are preparing for an [DATE-6] review or [DATE-7] review with her.
Agent: You have this ability to dive really deep on her, even if she's one of like hundreds or thousands of clients that you have, you can keep track of these. valuable pieces of information.
Agent: You can reach out to her on her birthday. You know that, you know, she's married and we can track that relationship.
Agent: We also know that maybe if we put the reasons first, the most recent things that she's done is, you know, move to [GPE-1]. She has this business that's associated with her.
Agent: And we can even start to dive a little deeper. But there are these fields that are standard, things that [ORG-6] fields, you would have to track for her.
Agent: Things like, you know, what kind of service model she has, what her account number is.
Agent: But there's also these more ephemeral pieces that you might want to keep track of to invite her to campaign, you know, Marketing events, to invite her to webinars, to talk to her about when she's, you know, to suggest something she might be interested in investing in.
Agent: Um, tags are kind of cool because they allow you to create new fields. Field creation is not something that we typically expose to like an end user and sales force, but it allows you to, um, track different things.
Agent: You can still report on these types of things and segment people out if you want to do like a Marketing campaign. Um, but it allows you to.
Agent: To go a little deeper, right?
Agent: And to do these different categories, it might be like charities or sports, or maybe even just risk tolerance that you want to keep track of within that kind of module.
EndUser: Cool. And easy, I assume, to jump into one of those and see a list of people that have real estate investments or are in that tag.
Agent: Sure, absolutely. It's just as simple as clicking on it. So we can see, we have a couple of records with interest <inaudible>. We have categories maybe within that. You can even who it's created by within your system.
EndUser: Okay, cool.
Agent: Any ideas on how you would start to use these capabilities?
Agent: Do you have these capabilities [DATE-1]?
EndUser: To some extent, probably. I mean, we definitely have list tagged capabilities. That's one of the wealth boxes strongest things. Probably on the [PRODUCT-2] side is just the easy ability to tag clients with various things.
EndUser: But it's difficult to actually go to the next step and utilize that, right?
EndUser: To actually make that tag work for you in some way, other than just assigning a tag to a, to a household or to a client.
EndUser: So the flow, the process of getting to, like you said, inviting clients to a specific event or a specific email campaign.
EndUser: I can see us using it by tagging clients with our specific portfolio sets, right?
EndUser: Our large cap dividend portfolio and maybe sending out specific communication to that group only if there's this particular piece that we want to talk about from that portfolio. So that would be interesting.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. It's a little bit off our story, but if we wanted to jump in here and maybe like filter our list of leads down to. Maybe we have expressed interest mortgage, probably don't want that one. Like investments.
Agent: You wanted to filter based on like where they are, right?
Agent: Could or something like that.
EndUser: Be like,
Agent: Little, [GPE-2]. You can filter this list down and then add those people. In this case, we're a little bit too, too filtered down.
Agent: We've just have But you have the ability to add all those people to a campaign really easily.
EndUser: A nice.
EndUser: It's
Agent: Like some dice as much as you want on any field you like.
EndUser: And those the lead piece of this, I mean, I definitely see that as tremendously helpful, especially for [PERSON-2] and I every [DATE-8], we were meeting, who are we talking to, you know, where are we at?
EndUser: Is it pretty easy to basically.
EndUser: Like leads and referrals, right?
EndUser: That would be team [PERSON-7], which is [PERSON-2] and I versus what [PERSON-8] and [PERSON-9] are working on or another advisor.
EndUser: It's pretty easy to filter that data based on users, correct?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Seriously. [PERSON-8] he's an advisor working
EndUser: Won't see my leads per se if in his book, right?
EndUser: Or another advisor that comes in and has their own leads.
EndUser: You know, we don't need to see their actual lead set, right?
Agent: Yeah. There's definitely the idea of ownership within the system. As leads come in, they can be auto-assigned or they can be manually signed.
Agent: It might be that you are importing a list of leads into the you want to assign them out manually.
EndUser: System and
Agent: That's totally possible here as well. But I'm operating from a super admin view where you can see all leads. But in most cases, you would only be able to see your own leads and then segment those down.
EndUser: Cool.
EndUser: Now I'm assuming you could automate it like... in that form building, I mean, is there a way to, like, auto assign based off of either who sent or yeah, have a response in the form, you know?
EndUser: Out the form
EndUser: Hey, which advisor are you reaching out about, you know, for the one on the advisor and then auto assigns?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: So the web, you could ask specifically questions that might help us assign them out, right?
Agent: If you ask, like, what state they're in, or like any and you had some sort of like territory and assignments or whatever the case may be a specialty where like one person has a specialty skill want to assign those people to that kind of logic can be built in but it's fairly common for like during that web to lead for you to Take the lead in assign it and then usually send some sort of like email saying for completing the lead, but it can be built out a lot more than that as well
EndUser: Would
EndUser: Thank you
EndUser: Awesome.
Agent: Great, we can dive a little bit more into Marketing campaigns later too.
Agent: Couple more things I wanted to call out on this [PERSON-5] person account here is the fact that there is so much that we can do from like an Integration standpoint.
Agent: I know this was like a big one for you folks is the unification systems. You can see data from all sorts of different systems kind of within here. We might have imported in any number of these fields.
Agent: Typically we see them from a portfolio management system as being our kind of key primary integration. Because it has those types of data fields. A lot of times they've already connected financial accounts.
Agent: We have a pretty good tracking of their investments from within those systems. But as a secondary wave, sometimes people will integrate in their financial planning system for goals.
Agent: If you're getting things directly from [PERSON-10], we could do that as well. We have that integration.
Agent: But a lot of times, you know, we're we get those in like a secondary waterfall, right?
Agent: From [FAC-1] or whichever portfolio management system you're going to use, they're already connected to those carriers, so we can kind of get them without adding too many integrations to your rollout.
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: This also allows you a really nice way to kind of act on that data as it's coming into, things that the portfolio management system doesn't necessarily have some of the time is things like, is it held away?
Agent: Do you own that investment or is it being invested somewhere else?
Agent: So you can also start to enrich the data as it comes in, whether this is something you're manually doing or we have some sort of automated rule behind the scenes saying, you know, if it is, you know, held, you know, each one of these has a file within.
Agent: And if the, the ownership is not with you, then we can check that box and
EndUser: Make it more of this.
Agent: Something that's also a little bit unique is that we are able to really deeply track relationships between people, especially for wealth.
Agent: We see that these relationships are so important, right, to the decision making of this person, like their risk appetite, the places they might want to invest, how they move their money around.
Agent: And of course, you have all of that great. networking for referrals that you want to kind of nurture as Of course, you can always track these relationships within people.
EndUser: Well.
Agent: Between people within these systems, but we built out a really nice way to structure various households, kind of a visual way for you to see not only [PERSON-6], but also maybe [PERSON-11] spouse.
Agent: And each one of these is actually a file behind the scenes. It's not just a name or gaming track of, these are linked accounts within the [ORG-1]. So we might be working on a case for [PERSON-4], where [PERSON-11].
Agent: We haven't made any, you know, any inroads to his accounts yet and that's a place we might want to grow. It also goes beyond just the household itself.
Agent: You can keep track of things like attorneys, trusters, like the company that she owns, right?
Agent: Or she might be a board member of. So those are great ways to kind of continue to, you know, get your tendrils into various different pieces of business as well.
Agent: Would this be valuable to you?
EndUser: Yeah, I think so.
EndUser: I think definitely the idea of better tracking opportunities and relationships, which we really don't have much, you know, we have an [PRODUCT-1] file right now that we're referencing, you know, to say where are we at?
EndUser: So, you know, the track, track connections, you know, where we met people at, who they're connected to, that would be helpful for sure. I mean, on the [PRODUCT-2] side of things.
Agent: Conversations that we tend to have with wealth management folks is like, what is the center of influence?
Agent: What is her center of influence?
Agent: How does she make decisions?
Agent: But also that generational transfer of wealth that you don't lose out on a customer.
EndUser: Makes sure
Agent: And then their whole family business by failing to nurture a relationship with their children. [ORG-7]. All right. The last thing that I definitely wanted to hit upon on this account page is these action plans.
Agent: Spoke to that a little bit during the initial discovery that we were doing. Want to make sure that these complex processes, like an account opening or an [DATE-6] review, They might be multi-step processes.
Agent: This allows you to stay organized, have basically a checklist of tasks, document collection that are all organized into one place. This can be kind of process driven.
Agent: So maybe I can't prepare the overview document until I book the room. They can also be assigned out to multiple team members.
Agent: Again, as you grow, as you specialize, it might be multiple touch points with multiple people that it takes to close something.
EndUser: Cool question
EndUser: With that.
EndUser: Can you integrate [ORG-8], I know you guys have the [ORG-8] integration, but does that go right?
EndUser: Can you integrate that right into the tasks by chance?
EndUser: Like link a specific document envelope or something like that. I'm just thinking through like the onboarding process. If the CRM Workflow literally was where we sent out the [ORG-8] and where we could view it, that would be awesome.
Agent: Yeah, I can definitely check on that for you. I don't think I've seen it in the task list, but I know we do have the Integration with all of essentially the templates within.
Agent: Um, so at the very least we could direct you to open up the correct template and send it out.
EndUser: Um,
Agent: But let me check for you to see if it can actually like the button can be within this task list.
EndUser: Cool. Sounds
EndUser: Good. Thank you.
Agent: Great. And to again, circle the box, there are action plan templates that come out of the box So this [DATE-6] review is a really popular one onboarding.
EndUser: Back to like what's out of
EndUser: As well.
Agent: Those are all things that we want to make sure that you have like a good starting place for, but you're probably customizing it a little.
EndUser: Yeah, but it's not something that's an add-on per se. Like it's just takes my take time for us to customize how we want it to be for our team or our firm.
Agent: Exactly. If your documents are a little different or the steps that you take, you know, it's very easy to edit
EndUser: It.
EndUser: I do have a general question here.
EndUser: So for Um, kind of from the perspective of, you know, super admin or whatever is where if we're creating this out, is it standardized for everybody at the firm?
EndUser: If we're building it out, um, do we have the ability to customize individually?
EndUser: Is that just a simple permissions thing?
EndUser: Like maybe it's like, Hey, you allow some people to customize. You allow some people not to, um, tell them what they can and can't customize.
Agent: Definitely.
EndUser: Probably just pretty much flexible.
Agent: I'd say it probably went a little too deep, but anything in our setup.
Agent: Capabilities like the behind the scenes editing, like what fields are we collecting on the page?
Agent: That you would want to restrict just to an admin or a couple of But the ability to edit data on a page, the ability to save things in, you can like go field by field and tell people what they can and can't do.
EndUser: Probably
EndUser: Admins, right?
Agent: So it is very granular.
EndUser: Or even like cards, right?
EndUser: Like let's say just as an example here, because the life events thing is here, I could protect.
EndUser: I usually see an advisor being like, you know what that's a lot of data that's a little bit complicated I've been running my business for.. . for [DATE-9] without having this mapped out.
EndUser: I don't want to add it.
EndUser: Can they just delete that card?
EndUser: And it doesn't exist for them, and they don't see it, and they don't need to see it empty?
EndUser: Or is that something that would need to be individually?
EndUser: Like, the super admin would need to go in and change it.
Agent: I think if you're going to change the page layout, we can do it by role, but it would probably be something you would want the admin to do, So like if an assistant didn't need to see life events, they didn't need to see this action launcher, we would take whole components of the page off and they would see a different view than a wealth kind of decide.
EndUser: Advisor. The role is the advisor, the wealth advisor, then they're going to see the same thing on each client that they open.
Agent: But you can build out different segments, right?
Agent: Like a very tech savvy wealth advisor versus your...
EndUser: It's like, theoretically,
EndUser: You could just build out a custom role if someone wanted something specific.
EndUser: You just couldn't...
EndUser: Anybody assigned to that same role is going to see the same thing, but you could always build out another role with a different view.
Agent: Yeah. It's
EndUser: Just depends on who's worth building that out the question.
EndUser: For is really
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: It makes sense.
Agent: You want to enforce some things, right?
Agent: It's We can take this life events component completely out, or we could put it within the financial accounts tab, where it's a little bit less in your face all the time.
EndUser: True. For sure. Yeah.
EndUser: Or something like that,
Agent: So you can build out what the master template looks like, and then deviate from
EndUser: There as well. Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Got you. That makes sense. I don't have anything against the life events so I.
EndUser: Thing. It was just right there, No worries.
Agent: All right, cool. Last thing I wanted to call out on the page is also the fact that we do have a couple of workflows that are also built out here as well. These are just fields on a page.
Agent: You can update them as much as you want, right?
Agent: But if you are going through something more complex, like in onboarding or scheduling an appointment or something like that, there are these quick actions that can either be built up here or over here in the action launcher.
Agent: This is just two ways to see similar data. And what they can prompt is something like an action or a screen flow that pops up . and collects X amount of data from you as the user.
Agent: So these are kind of more workflow-based items. We do have out-of-the-box ones for client onboarding and like [ORG-6], like adding a beneficiary. There's different ways that they can be surfaced to you.
Agent: So you saw the screen pop up, but this one also can open up a tab. And they just kind of take the information that's already here. We know all of her financial accounts.
Agent: And then we can go ahead and collect the information that's necessary.
EndUser: And that data, like, for instance, if it was connected to [PERSON-10], that's obviously not is beneficial information so that we can bring over from there.
Agent: That's more key. I would say I would have to check in to the [PERSON-10] integration. I think [ORG-9] is mostly for like account data. We can like automatically open account with [PERSON-10] or something like The system.
EndUser: That.
Agent: But you would have the data that you need to do so.
EndUser: Yeah, the data living in one place is important just centralizing that.
Agent: Yeah. And [ORG-1] is a totally open API company. We want to integrate if there is capability to do so.
Agent: Carriers have traditionally been a little bit more closed off just because they're big guys, big players, and they can kind of do what they want. You can throw their weight around. But Made-In [GPE-3] with [PERSON-10].
EndUser: We have
Agent: I know you work with [GPE-4] also, a page on their website that said they were open to integration.
EndUser: And they had
Agent: So whatever you feel you
EndUser: Need at the end of the panel.
Agent: All right, fantastic. I did want to give you one example of what a file might look like if it's a little less built out as well. I know [PERSON-6], we have [QUANTITY-1] of information for her.
Agent: But on [DATE-10]. You know, your records might look a little bit more like [PERSON-9] here. You have a couple of important life events that you can put in there.
Agent: We have a little bit of information about his interests, but this might be someone that we want to grow a little bit more, make more inroads with.
Agent: And there's also a lot of rules and automation that you can build it around that.
Agent: I was just talking with a client about like a flow that would be running behind the scenes that would be checking to see when was the last activity that was logged on this account.
EndUser: We
Agent: Can designate them as cold or hot based on that last activity and we can actually kind of set a status make it a field based on that.
EndUser: But that would be good.
EndUser: Can we have like at the firm level, for instance, if [DATE-6] reviews are something we want, you know, every client to have at some point, then we can run, you know, like you said, what does that call the flow report?
Agent: A
EndUser: Flow?
EndUser: Constantly reporting, you know, if it's been outside of [DATE-11] since the last annual review or something like that.
Agent: Yeah, something that have done in the past is just automatically set.
EndUser: Clients
Agent: So when they finish out that action plan, when they log the [DATE-6] review as complete, it automatically creates a new one now.
EndUser: Right here from
Agent: Then you get all of that like tasks that are said, reminder schedule this right that That's another way to are set up.
EndUser: Cool. do that. That's helpful for sure.
Agent: Fantastic. Cool. So I'm going to back out of the file itself. And I want to take us to a little bit more of that, like reporting and dashboard That was very important for you.
EndUser: Piece.
Agent: Something we saw on our main homepage was just this ability to kind of see from a wealth advisor standpoint. what the information looks like.
Agent: You have the ability to kind of build out as many dashboards as you need to slice and dice the data to show you important things. We do have a couple of reports that come out of the box.
Agent: Essentially, each one of these dashboard widgets is a visualization of a report. So if I click into this, this is my close deals. And this can show you all that data that it's kind of pulling in here.
Agent: So if you wanted to create a custom report, a custom widget, you wanted to see the data in a different way, slice and dice differently. That's how you do that.
Agent: And you can turn any, any report into a dashboard.
EndUser: Okay. Cool.
EndUser: Is this the accelerator piece?
EndUser: I'm just want to be sure, like, clear what I'm looking at. Like the. The [ORG-10] accelerator that [ORG-11] said came with it.
EndUser: Is this what we're looking at?
EndUser: Or is that more wealth management focus on bringing in custodial data, et cetera?
Agent: This is, so [ORG-11] for advisors, the solution I'm showing you right that accelerator are kind of like two ways to say the same thing.
EndUser: Now, and
Agent: It's OK. And this is part of it,
EndUser: A package together. for sure. OK, got it.
Agent: You might have seen ways to extend this.
Agent: If you wanted to get much more in depth, if you got much more sophisticated, your company have this like [PERSON-11] or like [PRODUCT-2] analytics where we can be pulling in more data from different sources that might not even be integrated with [ORG-1] and be putting them together at [DATE-5].
EndUser: [PERSON-16], we do
Agent: But I don't think based on what we talked about, it's probably not
EndUser: Something you want.
Agent: If that [ORG-9] is already [FAC-1] or [PERSON-16], then the information is in [ORG-1] and anything in [ORG-1], we can pull it to our report.
EndUser: Happening with like
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I guess and just to be
EndUser: Clear here, just I think we've talked a little bit about like, you know, potentially like bringing in information from [FAC-1].
EndUser: I think kind of at least how we've been thinking about it is kind of a either [FAC-1] or. Salesforce kind of thing.
EndUser: So I for clarification there as you're thinking through how it would apply, we just want to make sure that Yeah, we wouldn't be getting both.
Agent: Just, just
EndUser: I don't think it would be kind of either one or the other. So if there's data that like we would need [FAC-1] for in order to get it into [ORG-1], that would be valuable.
EndUser: That'd be an issue. Yeah. For sure.
Agent: Yeah. We were
EndUser: Kind of exploring the full suite of solutions with [ORG-1] to say, hey, could this tackle our major needs, right?
EndUser: At least right now. And so the [PRODUCT-2] side is fantastic.
EndUser: We're looking for a little bit more also on the data side in terms of pulling things in from both our custodians, making sure everything's kind of in one place there as well within the system.
Agent: Okay. Do you have a portfolio management system that you're using [DATE-1] instead of [FAC-1]
EndUser: Or [GPE-4] kind of is the starting place because it now they take a custodial feed directly from [PERSON-10].
Agent: So
EndUser: Like I see all my [PERSON-10] households and accounts through [GPE-4]. So like they're already segmented out into households and assigned through [GPE-4]. So, you know, if there's any way to build that out.
EndUser: I mean, [PERSON-2] and I were talking [DATE-1] and [PERSON-8], you and I will talk more offline.
EndUser: But really, the appeal of [FAC-1] was to bring in, you know, sort of our planning data, our risk-alized data, and custodial data.
EndUser: So we just have more information in our fingertips, maybe more to present to a client in a portal.
EndUser: And also the reporting element, like performance reporting for clients, not just generating reports of our lead activities and stuff like that. So being able to go to account level performance for clients was pivotal. Now, [PERSON-11] does that.
EndUser: So we can do that if there's an easy way for us to download the report for [PERSON-11] and make sure we can drag it into the [PRODUCT-2] somehow.
EndUser: Hosted to a client portal, send them an email with a link to it from [ORG-11] or another secure file sharing.
EndUser: There's plenty of ways to say, hey, maybe that is stil l incredible value for us But we were trying to kind of see if [ORG-16] s was or if [ORG-1] rather was more that one stop shop .
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Short answer, no, we don't have another portfolio management technology.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: [PERSON-11] fills a couple of those But yeah, we're not using anything else.
EndUser: Gaps.
Agent: Okay. I would say our, our most successful engagements do hook up to a portfolio management system as kind of like the system of record. If that is ultra, I think we can definitely make that happen for you folks.
EndUser: Kind of you because that's important because you kind of want the one place like the source the one source of truth right of where data feeds are coming from.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Kind for
Agent: Of like a primary source of truth those pieces and you know sales forces a a CRM we slice and slice and dice the data.
Agent: But typically like from a data storage standpoint like a again like a system of record. We do typically lean on a portfolio management Okay, so that could be outrost in this switch it up.
EndUser: System.
EndUser: Case and I'll just diamond
Agent: Sorry to be using black confusing because they offer both the [PRODUCT-2] layer as well
EndUser: As that management. All right.
Agent: So this was my final kind of look. Again, dashboards can look super different depending on who, who it's built for, what the purpose is. You can start to have these like super high level CEO dashboards.
Agent: One of the benefits and the differentiators of [ORG-1] is that we can have Marketing and sales and even like service information all in one place. and stitch all of those pieces together for you.
Agent: Because ultimately it's the same people behind the scenes. We're a very like person-centric system. It's the same people who are doing all of those things.
Agent: And we want to make sure that we keep track of their happiness by keeping track of their service cases. But we mark it to them based on the information that we know. And we keep all
EndUser: Of that.
Agent: All right.
Agent: Any questions on reports or dashboards?
EndUser: Can No, all looks great
Agent: I move forward?
EndUser: For now.
Agent: All right, cool. I do want to touch really briefly upon campaigns. This is like the first level of how you could start to do marketing. This is what's baked into [ORG-11] for advisors. So I wanted to start there.
Agent: Um, as you start to build out your Marketing capability and you start to like do things like, um, run events.
Agent: Might be you just want to nurture a specific segment of your clientele, be just a general broadcast for everyone that you know or based on certain traits.
EndUser: Might
Agent: You can build out campaigns. And this is how they're kind of, we start to like segment out customers and assign them to these different rolling campaigns.
Agent: Essentially, the goal is to track effectiveness of the campaign and also to attribute, you know, to start to link those related campaign members, right, to this campaign.
Agent: So if we start to see a lot of action, we start to see that they've- responded or they've attended these events, then we can start to see which of these campaigns are more successful, which we should be doing more of, which we should probably improve.
Agent: We do higher levels of Marketing tiers depending on how sophisticated you want to be.
EndUser: Have
Agent: This is again just like the free one that comes with [ORG-11] for advisors, but I think what [ORG-11] might have already, you know, Put in your minds is [ORG-16] .
Agent: A tool set that we can kind of layer on top of this as well. And essentially what [ORG-11] allows you to do is really start to dig in deep with, you know, reports and dashboards and attribution.
Agent: There's all sorts of like email tracking on opens and and making sure that you can start to really see the behavior. These various people and how it drives towards sales opportunities and like new accounts being onboarded new customers.
EndUser: Okay, so this isn't where we would, you know, effectively we can probably click into any one of these contacts, send them an email from here, right, for [ORG-11] out of the box.
Agent: Oh yeah, and you can, you know, send a list email to all of these campaign members.
Agent: I think that's the benefit, right?
Agent: You start to segment do actions to the whole group based on features, yeah.
EndUser: Them,
Agent: So if I wanted to send them a list email. There's plenty of ability in here to do that kind of base level templating.
Agent: But again, something that [ORG-11] would allow you kind of add on is like newsletters with segmentation. It's a lot more kind of sophisticated like. build of those beautiful Marketing documents.
EndUser: Out
EndUser: Right, that's Okay, But easily being able to send it to a recipient list of sorts, people from a certain company in a certain industry, can just have all those lists built out.
Agent: A little bit more sales focused. cool. Tactical.
Agent: You Absolutely.
EndUser: It's helpful.
Agent: [ORG-11], did you have anything you wanted to add there?
Agent: On the Marketing piece, no. It's kind of again just dependent on what you guys are looking for.
Agent: If this is going to be kind of enough for you within [ORG-3] cloud or if you want to dive a little bit deeper into [ORG-11] cloud.
Agent: That's kind of up to you in terms of pricing. I included kind of [ORG-16] in like your your proposal. So it all falls within budget.
Agent: I just want to understand kind of your guys use case a bit more to be able to give you more the most accurate kind of the Price and everything.
Agent: So that's kind of up to you guys, but In terms
EndUser: We can. of the marketing. Yeah.
Agent: I mean, Two folks, do you want me to dive in deeper there?
Agent: I can show you
EndUser: A lot more. I mean, if you can show me a little bit more on that might be helpful. I don't think that's something we need to necessarily commit to right away.
Agent: Yeah, it was
EndUser: Just sort of a hey, if this can do it, that's amazing because. We're talking about sending out email campaigns. If somebody responds or clicks through a link, we want to send them to this list.
EndUser: It'll go out with this email. And so those are fun things to think about, but they're not by any means. Just being able to better track leads and email people from a campaign.
EndUser: It all gets logged into their contact file. And it's all in one place. That's super helpful for us to begin with.
Agent: And this is always something that we can phase out as well if you wanted to get started with just the [PRODUCT-2] first and then you know if this was something you wanted to explore we can always.
EndUser: Phase
Agent: To another time. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah. I don't know if we need.
EndUser: I mean, is there anything specific that you wanted to see real quick?
EndUser: Because I think we more of our time on the other.
Speaker 5: Probably should spend
EndUser: Yeah, it's
EndUser: Fine. I have to be my guest. At least for now. I don't know if there's anything specific you wanted to see or had a question about. I think we could address that now.
EndUser: But in terms of like a demo, I think if we got a little bit closer to. You know, if we feel like we needed a full service we can demo those
EndUser: Is there, then we
Agent: Other ones for sure.
Speaker 5: Just a quick question. I don't imagine there's any [ORG-23] that is produced and available for advisors on emailing Marketing side.
Agent: You mean just like out of the box kind of like templates
Speaker 5: And things?
Speaker 5: Correct.
Agent: I don't
Speaker 5: Believe [DATE-6] reviews referral opportunities clip small clip videos you know things like you know four-fielder you know but that's what their pure job is but i just know if there was any templates are would we we'd be building them all out ourselves what i assume
Agent: Yeah, I think from an email perspective, customers tend to want to build those themselves.
Agent: We can definitely talk a little bit about recommending your partner for implementation, and they can give you a lot of guidance around that, but I don't think we have any emails that come
EndUser: Out of the box.
Speaker 5: No worries, thank you.
Agent: Absolutely. OK. Great. So I think the last thing I definitely wanted to hit upon [DATE-1] because I didn't realize we were so close to time, is that portals piece had talked quite a bit about.
EndUser: That you
Agent: So we've talked a lot about what's available for advisors.
Agent: Obviously, this is kind of like the full set of data that is in sales force that's available to them that we want to make sure that they can access with various levels of permission, but There are other people that you may want to bring into the conversation.
Agent: And this is, I have a couple examples of what. a website might look like a might look like for your customers.
EndUser: Portal.
Agent: This is an example of a portal. Again, this is a little bit of a very broad template my data is not filtering in [DATE-1].
EndUser: And unfortunately,
Agent: But this is a look at how we could start to get that information back out to your clients. So this is the homepage. It has a couple of alerts on here about an RMD.
Agent: We have some suggested actions that you might want to surface up to your customers. We have some webinars and info sheets that you might want to surface up to them.
Agent: But they also have this ability to view their accounts and summaries within this. So anything that we have in [ORG-1], we could list out We can also segment it out.
EndUser: For them.
Agent: You have here accounts versus documents that they might have uploaded. And whatever you decide to kind of expose to them, you can have here.
Agent: So you can see how it's similar to what might be exposed to an advisor, but it's also a little sure.
EndUser: Bit different. It's presented differently for
Agent: This can be a great place to collect documents, to help them to make them available to them.
Agent: So this might be, stuff that you want available to them for download or something where you might be, you know, collecting documents from them.
Agent: You can give them a checklist of things that they I think you asked about action plans and exposing that to a client.
EndUser: Need. And
Agent: Definitely something we can do if there's more like task-based stuff. But it's also a great place to just like set up appointments or have a question that same kind of calendaring.
Agent: Capability, you can go ahead and set an invite on your advisor's calendar or request, a meeting.
EndUser: You know,
Agent: So obviously this doesn't look completely beautiful the way that you might want but that is the capability that's available there.
EndUser: To see it,
Agent: And we do want to make sure that you know that We do have portals for customers. We might have portals for partners as well as you start to develop Different ways to slice and face the data.
EndUser: Those.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: I wanted to ask too, um, if you guys had time to review the email I sent and could kind of give us a better understanding on if you think you fit better with like logins versus members.
Agent: So we can kind of get a better idea on that as well as far as which one
EndUser: Would be better for you. Yeah, we saw it. I think that knowing a little bit more, a little deeper of the platform now, I don't think portals would be even necessary for us if we're to use [ORG-1].
Agent: I think
EndUser: If we if we still needed, you know, we'd either.
EndUser: Get folks to have a portal login with [PERSON-11] if we wanted to sort of build on their portfolio management system or wait until we do a black diamond or something like that.
EndUser: Because if the data, basically what we wanted in the portal was a client's risk-alized score to come through any planning, you know, summary that comes through and then performance data.
EndUser: So unless we're, unless we're pulling performance data, you know, from altruist or [FAC-1] or wherever else, it doesn't seem necessary to go down the portal route with [ORG-1]. So I guess maybe this is good.
EndUser: I really appreciate putting, you know, all that you guys have put together. It's exciting for. a lot of reasons.
EndUser: There's a lot of really great features, I think, that our firm would use certainly as we're growing our business and tracking leads better, just overall more seamless you know, cohesion and uniformity within the client contact records, right, sending emails events, everything just seems more in one place, which I do think offers tremendous value to us I think if anything, we'd be looking for maybe the scaled down [ORG-11] version of, hey, basically what can we use this to do everything [ORG-21] does and then som e?
EndUser: With salesforce sort of the molar, all-inclusive big picture, you know, if we were to go down that road with [ORG-1].
Agent: Versus
EndUser: [PERSON-8], did I capture that?
EndUser: Okay, you think the spirit of where we're at [DATE-1]?
EndUser: I think, at least me personally, I think I still have a couple of questions on the not entirely clear on full capabilities. And I think that,
EndUser: Kind of would determine whether or not having that portal would be something we we want. So I agree with you, but I don't I wouldn't say like Immediately like as of now, like we don't want it.
EndUser: I just I think I need to understand a little bit more of like, okay.
EndUser: This data integration, this need for a portfolio manager, managing company, can we bring in all that data just directly from an Integration with [PERSON-10]?
EndUser: Is there the ability to, which I don't think we touched on.
EndUser: Like is there the ability to show performance data or generate reports for the client based off of their portfolio performance?
EndUser: Cause I think those kinds of answers would, maybe I missed it.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: Maybe maybe we already we already talked about that. So if so, I apologize, but
Agent: No, that's totally reasonable question to ask. I think [ORG-9] is generally for the client information. So it allows you to pull in all of those accounts. The balances.
Agent: Sometimes allows you to pull in like things like a golds and held away. I don't think it's pulling in the performance. like on that granular level. But I can check into that for you.
Agent: I want to make sure that I'm not telling you lies. Because yeah, typically we would see that portfolio management system having at least a little bit of a differentiated role to play.
EndUser: Got you. OK, yeah, that's helpful for me just because I think that wasn't completely clear. With that,
EndUser: Yes, I would agree with [PERSON-16]'s sentiment I think we need a portal that can there.
Agent: Do that. Well, so I think we need another meeting to dive a little bit deeper into some of these other touch points and figure out which solution is going to be best.
Agent: And then did you guys put any more thought into the Implementation partner piece?
Agent: Like is there someone that you want to have me set up an introduction with or?
EndUser: No, not at this time.
EndUser: I think we want to just still we're just trying to kind of wrap our hands around exactly what sales force would mean for us and how we'll use it as a and then decide the best route to go with implementation.
Agent: Firm, you know,
EndUser: Because if it's really just like a, you know, If it's more of what you've shown us, [PERSON-23], there's a couple other things you said you added, but those all seem very easy for us And then obviously just implementing getting the data feeds correct with how we're synchronizing across platforms is important.
Agent: To add. Yeah.
EndUser: But I don't think this is going to require a big custom, build that with the way we might use you guys going forward.
EndUser: So I think looking ahead, I would, you know, we'll examine it together and say, OK, what value does this bring right now?
EndUser: We know we want to. want to grow, we want to be on board with someone that's, you know, we can grow wit h and build out much larger capability in the future.
Agent: Certainly
EndUser: So that's exciting.
EndUser: So we jus t want to see like what those costs would be for, you know, hey, out of the box with thes e features that we know we're going to use, you know, versus some of the other bigger stuf f we might get you down the road .
Agent: We can also send over a summary of all the pre-configured pieces that I showed you [DATE-1], just so you remember what you've seen.
Agent: And I'll definitely jump in and make sure I get all the details on [ORG-9] for you.
EndUser: For sure. I think a big thing would be on the forms side as well of... Anytime we can kind of like digitize things that either clients, prospects are filling out.
EndUser: I'm even thinking of, you know, [PERSON-9], our firm owner just called me [DATE-1] and said, Hey, I've got a guy who needs life insurance. And so he wants to pass him to [PERSON-2] and I to do a policy.
EndUser: So like something as simple as him going in to our website or somewhere else and just typing in the data.
EndUser: So now it lives in the important just to make sure, you know, Cases don't fall through the cracks that we're staying on top of referrals.
Agent: System. Like that's
EndUser: And then as a firm, we can. better track that too, who referred . you know, to whom.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So it sounds like another kind of use case for that web to lead, making sure you can capture all the referrals that are coming in.
Agent: But also we have, you know, I think that's another strength of [ORG-1]. This is just a piece of the overall [ORG-11].
Agent: If you folks decide to like dive deeper into insurance in the future, you know, if you decide to dive more into like loans and things like that.
Agent: There are capabilities beyond kind of just wealth, what we've shown you [DATE-1]. I still think wealth is a great place but you could build out a Workflow for collecting the correct insurance for your internal to start,
EndUser: Information team. For sure.
EndUser: Yeah, even as something as simple as, one of us going in, typing in the referral, and then just knowing it gets automatically put in a lead campaign referrals from [PERSON-9] or something like that, so we're making sure we're tracking everything.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, I would say those are probably the two use cases. The integrations, the knowledge on the integrations, each of the integrations that you have, and these like work customized automations and rules to make everyone's life easier.
Agent: Those are the two places where I would say a partner might be helpful
EndUser: To bring in some insight. And comment for sure.
EndUser: Okay, I do have a question. I, I said, I don't think introduction with a partner is necessary right now, but if you do have any advisors that, you know, are on.
Agent: Fsc
EndUser: That you'd be willing to make the introduction for us. We could have a conversation with them and see how they've, you know, what their experience has been like.
EndUser: Um, I think that's on that note, [PERSON-8], I know you brought up last time.
EndUser: Do you guys have, uh, you know, do you have any figures trends that would excite us, you know, people that have come over from wealth box or otherwise and have seen great use Cases for, um, for [ORG-11].
EndUser: Or any
Agent: Yeah, definitely. I have a [ORG-24] channel completely dedicated to [ORG-11] for advisors. So I will find some good stuff in there for you guys and make an introduction.
EndUser: What would be I know we're running at a time here, so I won't be long, but with, you know, [PERSON-2] and I and how we're working together sort of as a team.
EndUser: You know, can you show us quickly what our best use case would be to stay more organized together, not just leads we're working, but also, you know, notes. Hey, talk to this client. Here's what we need to do.
EndUser: Send out a task, that kind of stuff. Just you can briefly run through that for me.
Agent: Absolutely. It's all here. I kind of that same modal that I used to set up my in [ORG-23], [PERSON-21], create a new event.
EndUser: Email from earlier
Agent: There's also this really nice capability of Chatter.
Agent: So it's going to automatically be keeping track of all the updates that are happening You can also use it for notes, for comments, keeping track of all of the activities that have happened on any particular file.
EndUser: Here.
Agent: So it's probably be a little bit of a combination of the two. If I wanted to pop up this new task . and assign it to myself.
Agent: This is kind of a manual version of some of those things I was talking about before, where we're creating a new task for that.
Agent: Any review, if I wanted to log a call, all of that gets logged in this activity log. So I want to keep track of all the comments of everything that I talked about so far.
Agent: This is also, I mean, so maybe close it out on something that's kind of fun and exciting.
Agent: This is something where [ORG-1] is really delving into AI and how generative [PRODUCT-3] can start to A lot of this note taking and summarizing and delving into the data that you already have in the system.
EndUser: Help.
Agent: In this case, we have an [PERSON-24] assistant called [ORG-23], who can start to like, summarize what's So you can say, Hey, can you please tell me a summary of what's happening on an outscape and they'll write it up for you.
EndUser: Happening on the account.
Agent: Or they could tell you, you know, what are some similar, you know, it's really conversational.
Agent: So like, what are some strategies that I've been working out recently on deals that have closed?
Agent: So this is like a nice way that [ORG-1] is starting to like look at the future. We're using all of these.
Agent: For many, many resources, and you get to take advantag e of all of the updates that are happenin g across all
EndUser: Of the clouds at [ORG-1] .
EndUser: And what is this like [FAC-2]?
EndUser: What is this environment we're looking at right now?
EndUser: Like even
Agent: That <inaudible>. It's a hard retail environment. So [LOC-1] is just an example company.
EndUser: Um, schedule call. Yeah.
EndUser: Just be, you know, so like what's the, can you show us back on the system?
EndUser: Is it just in the in the comments place?
EndUser: Like where's the best place for notes?
EndUser: Cause [ORG-21] does that really well right now is being able to like you basically type at like a social media handle and type the client's name and you can quickly log in note.
EndUser: You know, what would be the equivalent here?
EndUser: That being the chatter section.
Agent: Yeah, I would think so. You might want to use chatter to keep track of major stuff on the account. It could also be a field. This is where it gets kind of to be your own workflow.
Agent: If I would actually say, like, maybe logging a call would be the best way to, like, I don't know how to type really fast.
EndUser: Because you're basically logging a meeting or a call or a zoom or whatever you did. You're logging Interaction with the client, Yeah.
Agent: Basically.
Agent: Okay. And this title can change. You can select.
Agent: Is it a call?
Agent: Is it a no?
Agent: Is it a customer meeting?
EndUser: Is it, you know, so that's how customizable. And then where's like the activity feed if we just wanted to see it bigger, like clients, like, could where.
EndUser: Like multiple you have or maybe like, you know, [PERSON-16] and [PERSON-2] are sharing clients.
Agent: And so [PERSON-16]
EndUser: Goes in and, you know, has a meeting with [ORG-26]. It shows at the top.
Agent: Okay. So it looks like this is what Chatter looks like.
Agent: If you bring it up independent of a file, it can be a great way for you to like, you would basically subscribe to all of the accounts that you're an owner of or that you're already attached to.
Agent: So that happens automatically, but you could also, you know, be welcomed into another account and you can share an update.
Agent: Probably wouldn't want to just like share it publicly based on nothing, but you can tag accounts and you can also notify people.
EndUser: Here
Agent: So maybe this is more akin to
EndUser: What you have [DATE-1]. That's very similar to what we have [DATE-1], yeah, for sure.
Agent: Yeah, and you can attach files. You know, there's a lot of updates that have been made recently about emojis and colors and styles and things like that.
Agent: But I think tactically, it's a good feed to understand what's been happening on your
EndUser: Accounts. Okay, cool.
EndUser: Does it save as a note if you post in there?
EndUser: Like if you do at client and do it, does it save it as a note?
EndUser: Or does it kind of save it separately as like a chatter input?
Agent: So I think we would want to do [PERSON-5]. There we go. And we would want to like make a note.
Agent: And then that would go ahead and share out to anyone who's like connected to [PERSON-6].
EndUser: Okay, anyone who has ownership of that, of that specific account.
Agent: And that would also show up on [PERSON-6]'s chatter feed, the one they were looking at earlier.
EndUser: So if you go back to that chatter that you just had up.
EndUser: And so for instance, I post the notes as make a note, [PERSON-2] can, [PERSON-2] will see that on the activity And if he writes a comment directly on that, right, clients not seeing that at all, this All internal.
Agent: Feed.
Agent: Is all internal.
EndUser: Okay. Got it.
Agent: Yeah. So you can have a full conversation in his well.
Agent: The reason this isn't as built out is because we've started to like move to, you know, things like [ORG-24], which are a little bit, it's like this, but a little bit more sophisticated where you can build out like customer channels and be having more cohesive conversations that aren't just kind of like comment style So that's definitely something you can look into if you don't have an internal Messaging system already.
EndUser: Like this.
Agent: But it's really all about collaboration.
EndUser: And I step.
Agent: Think each other is a great first For sure.
EndUser: Cool. Well, thank you guys very much. I appreciate the more full tour of the [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: Yeah, definitely.
Agent: What would make sense for you guys for next step should we set up another meeting where we can kind of go a little bit deeper into the portals use case if you think it's something that will work for you or not or just any other questions and things that we can get more clear on.
Agent: With
EndUser: The [PRODUCT-2]?
EndUser: I think I would say we would need crystal clarity on the altruist Integration if we can pull data because altruist again is feeding in [PERSON-10] So, we can use altruist as the one source of truth for the [PRODUCT-2], then that's super helpful because it'll have all the data necessary there.
Agent: Data.
EndUser: And then I don't know what [PERSON-8] and I have already commented on for portals. I don't know if that's something we need to necessarily do a whole meeting on right now.
EndUser: I think we need to go back to the board for us and say, awesome. This is super robust, certainly does a little bit more than [ORG-21] does.
EndUser: And then say what is the firm's path forward in terms of use case, you know, with sales force versus what we're currently using.
EndUser: I think clear pricing options think we talked generally, but I don't think we got into specifics.
EndUser: As well. I
EndUser: So I think that would be.
EndUser: Very helpful, especially if of at this point, it sounds like we'll need to still be considering a portfolio management system, I think ultra does a couple things, but I think, you know, they don't do everything.
EndUser: We kind
Agent: Which
EndUser: So if we need to go that route, we'll likely need to pull the trigger on something like [FAC-1], which then, you know, they're expensive as well. So just we need to be thinking about the cost there.
Agent: No, for sure. Yeah, and this meeting has helped a lot.
Agent: Get
Agent: Me a more clear view on what to expect here with cost and everything that we've seen [DATE-1].
Agent: So this But do you guys want to meet on maybe [DATE-11]?
EndUser: Helps.
EndUser: Uh, [DATE-4], the rest of [DATE-4] is going to be tougher so probably [DATE-9] if we need to schedule it, um, but we don't necessarily have to put it on Okay.
Agent: For me. Um,
Agent: Yet.
EndUser: Uh, if, if there's a way for you, [ORG-11] to send us a little bit, hey, if you go this lane, here's what you're looking at.
EndUser: If you go this lane, this will put you on a platform to expand to this and it might turn into this. Just a little bit more options so we can digest.
EndUser: Hey, is this something we're able to do sooner rather than later?
EndUser: Do we need to really, you know, make sure that we have all ducks in a row to bring on black?
EndUser: Time in first, etc. I think that's what we'll look at for next steps .
Agent: Okay, cool.
Agent: We'll come up with kind of a list of all these things that we wanted to get some more clarification on and I'll get some, some trends and advisors to make the introduction to you too and everything and then all put together kind of just an overview on what cost looks like with [ORG-26] and kind of give you different options [PRODUCT-4].
EndUser: There.
Agent: And we can go from Thank you.
EndUser: There. Sounds good.
Agent: Yeah, of course.

They also appreciated the potential for growth and building out larger capability in the future. However, it is not explicitly mentioned that they felt any specific feature would be the most impactful.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current process for tracking leads and referrals, as well as their specific pain points and challenges. This would have helped tailor the demo to better address the customer's needs and showcase the value of the sales rep's product in solving their problems.

2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's use of forms and their current integration with their existing systems. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's needs and provide a more tailored solution.

3. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific use case for portals and how they currently manage client interactions. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more targeted demo and address the customer's specific needs.

4. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current process for tracking notes and interactions with clients. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's needs and provide a more tailored solution.

5. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific needs and use case for AI and generative [PRODUCT-3]. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more targeted demo and address the customer's specific needs.

video_19756_167_6qr3y000000g3QoAAI,"Agent: I can.
EndUser: All
Agent: Right,
Agent: So as valid promised, you guys have me or I have you guys for [TIME-1] or so. So we got a lot of Content here that we prepared. Let's just keep this interactive.
Agent: I try to keep these a little more conversational and make sure that you guys are getting all the information you need and getting all your questions answered.
Agent: What we like to typically do is kind of frame these demonstrations up in the kind of a storyboard format. So I'll be taking you through the experience from the customer's perspective.
Agent: So you see there on the top left, our customer [PERSON-1] customer of various. She is a systems architect with convex insurance [ORG-1] And she's going to be interacting with the various customer support specialist who is [PERSON-2].
Agent: So you'll be spending plenty of time with [PERSON-2] as he manages his Interaction with [PERSON-1] as well as others through the service console and Which is kind of the primary UI for the Service Cloud And then we have [PERSON-3] who is the barris could count manager.
Agent: So Obviously will be showcasing the ability to interface not only with customers externally, but also internally With other colleagues. So in this case it'll be support working closely with sales account management.
Agent: And then [PERSON-4], she's a various support manager and she manages day-to-day operations for the use of configurable dashboards and what we call our on-the-channel dashboard, which gives her that real-time visibility into her contact center resources and kind of, she can see who's doing what and where and when at any point in time.
Agent: So more specifically, Our customer [PERSON-1], she has an issue or she's got a question regarding SQL claims server that she's in the process of configuring.
Agent: So she's going to go out to our support portal where she can review knowledge based articles. She can get the tech. Tech docs.
Agent: She can even engage with conversations or discussions with other customers as well through our Q&A discussions or what we like to call peer to peer self service. Ultimately, she's not going to get all the information she needs.
Agent: So, of course, she's going to submit a case that case is going to be routed to the various support desk and it's going to land with our good friend [PERSON-2], whereas promise will be spending time with [PERSON-2] as he's managing this case.
Agent: You'll get a good feel for his immediate access to all the relevant data and all the relevant tools that he needs to respond in an efficient personalized and accurate manner as he interacts with [PERSON-1].
Agent: We'll touch on his ability to interact with [PERSON-1] within the community so he can, you know, post or kind of direct mess. Through the community interface, he can also email with hers.
Agent: And then we'll get into the account manager. So the account manager can monitor not only cases, but all of our other relevant [PRODUCT-1] data through the use of her mobile app.
Agent: So we'll bring up the mobile app as [PERSON-3], and I'll give you a quick tour around how she can access, much of which you'll see from [PERSON-2]'s experience, all that data, all those tools are available to other folks such as [PERSON-3] through her mobile app.
Agent: Then we'll finish up with reporting analytics and then the persona of How's that sound?
EndUser: [PERSON-5]Agent: So, so, right. Yeah, action packs, like you mentioned earlier. Um, let's jump into it.
EndUser: We're going to start
Agent: Off the barn. So again, you guys can see my screen. Okay. Uh, you can see here that we took some liberties. Uh, we borrowed a few of your assets off of your existing website.
Agent: And we've stood up in a relatively quick manner, a self-service portal, right?
Agent: So this allows folks like [PERSON-1], you can see that [PERSON-1] is authenticated in. So she has a very personalized experience.
Agent: Obviously, this support portals don't have to require, or they can be public facing, right?
Agent: Oftentimes they are. You can get to public facing content, documents, training, videos maybe, as well as Knowledge Articles and so forth.
Agent: But obviously when someone like [PERSON-1] logs in, we have her profile, we know who she is, we've got all that rich contact information that's sitting within our [PRODUCT-1], and now we can deliver a more personalized experience for her.
Agent: So she scrolls through her homepage. She can. get to various data such as her cases that maybe she's submitted and she can get a quick view into what the status of those cases are.
Agent: Based upon her purchase history, her product usage, we can also start servicing up relevant product information, maybe even training suggestions around training and so forth.
Agent: All right, you'll notice here in the bottom right, You know, our Service Cloud in our platform is multi channel or we like to call on the channel.
Agent: So at any point in time, if a customer such as [PERSON-1] wants to escalate into a live channel, such as a chat or even a phone call, they may be wanting to do some Messaging through a WhatsApp or SMS, all that's available to them as well.
Agent: You can also see this is highly configurable, right?
Agent: So this, these are kind of template based, allows you to take an existing template as an administrator and design and configure these sorts of experiences and then deploy and test them all from a single user interface which is the admin console.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: So a typical [ORG-2] administrator would have the ability to stand up these portal environments, test them out, deploy them, maybe start small, maybe do a little bit of A, B and testing, depending on the type of Content you want to share, and then you can deploy it to a wider spread audience over time.
Agent: And you'll notice here we've got some tabs, Right?
Agent: If I click on groups that give you a little glimpse into our ability to allow our customers to interact with each other. This is where they can maybe join a group.
Agent: Maybe it's a product beta testing group or a user group.
Agent: These groups can be private, so that's basically invite only, where you could have half a dozen to multiple dozens, even hundreds of individuals, if you want, can share information, ask questions, all more of a private manner.
Agent: Or we can have public tracing groups as well. So this is just folks where they're asking questions, getting answers to those questions, sharing best practices.
Agent: We can also provide collaboration, not only between your customers, but between customers and folks with [GPE-1]
Agent: Maybe it's product managers, even developers, okay?
Agent: So, you know, that's what we like to refer to as peer-to-peer service. Sharing of ideas would be another way where we can have customers maybe submit enhancement requests.
Agent: We can tag those enhancement requests and track them, you know, for other folks to view and maybe even vote on. And then based upon the popularity of those ideas, we might even work those into our product roadmap. Okay.
Agent: We can extend this environment to include pretty much any data object that resides within [ORG-2].
Agent: We'll see cases where we've got a glitz in the cases, but whether it's orders or invoices, product information, the ability to maybe step through a particular flow or a process is also available here to your end users.
Agent: In fact, when we go back here to home, I'm going to click on get started.
Agent: We talk about the automation through workflows, right?
Agent: So we can expose workflows out to our customers. This is a simple onboarding workflow.
Agent: As I'd mentioned, it could be a product registration Workflow or maybe a return or an [EVENT-1] type of Workflow where a customer can be prompted to go ahead and provide information, validate information, Here I'm just creating a, maybe a user account as part of my onboarding process.
Agent: I'm not gonna complete all these. But once I complete this information that I'm prompted for, I can validate that information and create the appropriate record. In this case, it could be like a user profile or something.
Agent: But this would apply to product registration or product returns, those seem to be kind of popular self-service processes.
Speaker 4: All right, so I asked a question here. Sure.
Speaker 4: These workflows [DATE-1], is this just within the platform?
Speaker 4: Can it make API cools to other systems and things like that?
Speaker 4: Yes. It is supported through what we call flows, which is our core automation flow management, Workflow tool, and yes, it's extendable to other systems, definitely. Thanks.
Speaker 4: So, I mean, the net here is getting the relevant information in need, the data in need, as well as engaging in the appropriate business processes.
EndUser: All right. Let's go ahead and a question regarding her claims server.
Agent: She has
EndUser: Sorry, sorry, I was just thinking a little bit there about the flow. If the flow involves, let's call it, multiple interactions. So, for example, they kick it off. They kick the flow off.
EndUser: Provide some basic information, we ask some questions, maybe we do a task, we then ask for some more input. And that's the natural flow. We know that there's going to be a two-ing of throwing between the parties.
EndUser: Is that all encodable?
EndUser: So, you know, we can have a Workflow that says get data, do automation, wait for user input, do next step.
EndUser: Is it like that kind of workflow?
Agent: Where we can have automated and manual tasks in that workflow. Yeah. So the data you're capturing, let's say or a form
EndUser: In a screen flow like it shown, can trigger follow-up if you will.
Agent: Tasks So yeah.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: It's that flow.
EndUser: A flow designer where you can visualize Yeah.
Agent: Okay. All right. I don't see it. We just call it our flow builder. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, for sure. That's Salesforce Flow. This is what we're touching on here, all right.
Agent: You're just seeing kind of the end product and the end user experience, but maybe as a follow conversation, we could spend [TIME-2] an hour diving a little bit more deeper into [PRODUCT-2]. You'll see it too.
Agent: I mean, it applies to the agent experience as well.
EndUser: So you'll see
Agent: Where these workflows come into play and help kind of drive automation with the agent experience. Thank you. All right. So remember, she's got a question regarding her claim server, calc engine configurations.
Agent: So she's just going to type in into the global search here, a search on claim server.
Agent: And this is essentially a global search, a [ORG-3]-like search, that's going to allow her to search across all the records and the [ORG-4] that's made available to her.
Agent: So you can see here you get a kind of a feel for the types of Content that she's searching through. In this case, it's just a short list of relevant knowledge based articles.
Agent: But you'll see I've got actually some production sites too that I'll bring up here in a second. But obviously, it can be much more comprehensive.
Agent: We're somewhat limited here in the demo environment as far as the data set itself. But once I find a document or an article, I can hover over to get a quick peek into this.
Agent: If I want to open it up, I can go ahead and click into it. This is just an example of a knowledge article. So we have a knowledge base. It's a core to our platform.
Agent: We can service up Knowledge Articles across most any channel. In fact, we can even syndicate or publish out knowledge [ORG-4] beyond just your support portal. So we can place little widgets like you hear on the right.
Agent: Those can be placed most anywhere across websites as well as mobile apps. Allowing your customers self serve at any point time wherever they may be in their support journey.
Agent: And these Knowledge Articles and support rich text, obviously [ORG-5], [ORG-6], even video can all be presented within the Content of the knowledge article. All right. Cool. Scroll down. Let's contact support.
Agent: So the story goes, she got the information she needs, but not all the information. So she's going to go and. put in some additional requests for support. She's gonna populate this configurable web form. Let's see, SQL.
Agent: And it's SQL claims, what type?
Agent: Obviously this is all configurable. These can be dynamic as well. So as she populates some of these fields with data, depending on what data is being provided, we can prompt her for some additional data.
Agent: And that's just it. The card pays.
Agent: And you'll notice that I'm populating this. We've got a little widget here on the far right that's updating.
Agent: So essentially in real time, it's evaluating the Content of the web form and providing sort of a last opportunity for [PERSON-1] to self-serve where it's servicing up relevant Knowledge Articles based upon the [ORG-4] that she's providing in the form.
EndUser: Right.
Speaker 5: Yeah.
Speaker 5: Do you capture how often people that go off and use these?
Speaker 5: It's cool rather than look at ticket. Yeah, so abandoned web form. We can do that. There's methods of doing that.
Speaker 5: If you want to get really granular, we typically would recommend using kind of website analytics tools such as [ORG-7] and others that are out there. But as you'll see, as we get into the agent experience.
Speaker 5: Much of the actions that [PERSON-1] is taking here, including the submitting the case, but also viewing content, that can also be shared with the agent.
Speaker 5: So once they pick up the case, they have even more context around what they were doing prior to submitting the case.
Speaker 5: So they can see kind of preview what what maybe Knowledge Articles or tech docs were already viewed reviewed by the customer before they submitted their case.
Agent: Right, so we do have some level of behavioral analytics and a certain level of click tracking that we can, that are part of our platform. All right, go ahead and submit.
Agent: You're gonna see that a case is created and we've got a unique case number here. In fact, if I click on it, The case is available for [PERSON-1].
Agent: So at any point in time she can go back to her portal. She can review the case. She can make updates. She can track the progress of the case.
Agent: In fact, let's go ahead and she's decided she's got a couple of documents here. She can attach most any type of document. I kept it simple here. I just pulled a couple PDF samples off your website.
Agent: But this could be CSS code. It could be XML code. It could be other type of word or what have you.
EndUser: Docs
Agent: We can attach these. They could be
EndUser: Up to two gigs in size. Then we go ahead and share. Quick one. Now this becomes a part of the case record as well. Yeah, of course.
EndUser: Can the original [ORG-4] be edited or is it once you've submitted it?
EndUser: The next update is another, effectively another
Agent: Public update by the customer.
Agent: Because I see editing means people need to know what changed or how did it work?
EndUser: Well, it's typically not you can make updates like I'm doing here, right?
Agent: So
EndUser: Yeah, you can't do that.
EndUser: Not the comment, right?
EndUser: Okay, fine, that's fine. So the reason why you might edit is, for example, pasted in some confidential
Agent: You might have inadvertently
Speaker 4: Material and you think, oh, I need to redact it.
Speaker 4: Is redaction possible?
EndUser: Never happened to us, of course, we've never done anything like that, but if theoretically, what were to put confidential information in place where someone wasn't meant to see it?
Agent: Yeah, we've had people put their passwords Okay, in before.
EndUser: Got it. Well, and we can kind of protect against that through data masking. Okay. Yeah.
Agent: It's not big deal because I think it is commonplace that you don't allow editing of the original comments and you just append new edits. Yeah, that's what we're seeing here. I haven't seen this. That's a good question.
Agent: I love box we don't allow editing. That's not to say maybe we have some sort of work around or some approach that might not enable that. All right.
Agent: So you got to feel for how we can kind of navigate our way through a self service portal. We talked a little about how, you know, these can be only the branding, but just the layout and the
EndUser: Easily configured, not [ORG-4] to provide that personal experience for the customers. Sorry, a couple of questions on this. Yeah, sure.
EndUser: A lot of our clients operate in the concept of a super user or a super representative for them, and they want to see all tickets for their organization or all tickets for their organization on product X, but not product Y.
Agent: Is there a granularity and service model for different personas within the client that can see not only their own, but other tickets?
Agent: Yeah. Simply put profiles just like we do with our core [ORG-2] users such as our service agents.
EndUser: And permissions
Agent: Those are applicable to our end users as well. We also have other concepts, administrative concepts, like sharing sets where a person has, she can be a super user for an entire account.
Agent: So let's say [PERSON-1] is a super user for convex insurance. She can see not only her own cases, but cases that have been submitted by other folks within her team at convex insurance.
Agent: And that applies to other records as well. We can service up orders and opportunities and so forth. Cool, thank you. Yep. Couple quick examples here, [ORG-8]. They are technology solutions, specifically a banking platform.
Agent: You can see that they've developed a support portal, specific for their developers. So they've got a developer community out there Developers can explore and share content. That [ORG-4] is organized by product area or solution area.
Agent: You can see we've got some discussion or peer-to-peer content. Knowledge-based articles are also surfaced up. Unanswered questions, most liked, and so forth, you can see there's some pop-up here notifications that we can also configure within the support experience.
Agent: If I wanted to, I could type in, well, let's make this quick. And I've got a question regarding the infinity solution. And now you see more filtered data where it's specific to a particular product.
Agent: And again, I'm looking across all content. So this is kind of like global search results, article, and forum content, as well as documentation. Then I've got some tabs up here that provide more immediate filtering of the relevant content.
Agent: Cool. Yeah. Another example, Snowflake, so think of hosted data warehousing solutions. They also have their community. It's very much a kind of peer-to-peer self-service community where they're experts.
Agent: They're customer experts and consulting experts can ask questions and get information amongst themselves. We have a certain level of gain of vacation.
Agent: So a lot of times consultants that are very knowledgeable around a product like to promote their services by engaging and being active out on these community websites. And that's what you see here on the right. All right.
Agent: And you can see how it's in the content. Not only do we have the global search, but we also have. the [ORG-4] organized by these different topics on the top. Yeah.
Agent: And create account, similar to what I saw demonstrated or what I showed you earlier, and as far as registering and creating account and creating a profile in the system.
Agent: And that allows me to then go in and authenticate and have a more focused, more personalized experience. All right.
Agent: Any questions?
Agent: We create a case. So what I was going to do is transition now over to the various support agent.
EndUser: Persona before I do that.
EndUser: Any last questions here on?
EndUser: No, I mean, this is virtually identical to what we're current capability. I mean, there's some bits
Agent: And pieces that are different, but yeah, it's the sort of thing we need to replace what we have with. So yeah, that's cool.
Agent: Yeah, and I think on that because I don't like to hear when you say it's exactly identical because I like to think it's much more powerful than your current state with the index.
EndUser: Point,
Agent: I mean, if we were to open up the administrative side, we can quickly get into the community builder you'll see that from that single, you know, administrative UI, we can design and test and deploy multiple communities, right?
Agent: So you can have communities for your developers for your end user. as you can have partner communities .
Agent: You can even stand up employee internal communities, right?
Agent: And be able to manage that all from a single administrative point. And you also have access to the same [PRODUCT-1] platform. So you can design those communities and surface up the relevant data.
Agent: You're not having multiple points of administration.
Agent: There's no real level of Integration back into [PRODUCT-1] because it's all sitting on top of your [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: Ok. From a customer perspective, it looks like both more there that we can do. I'm not sure.
EndUser: I don't feel like communities and peer-to-peer sharing that other companies
Speaker 4: We have the same
Speaker 5: Might have. We've chosen not to. That's the feature we haven't used. We try to use it. Yeah, but I feel I don't feel we necessarily benefit from it because I don't.
EndUser: Well, I think the point that [PERSON-6] made is quite interesting is actually using it for our own communities inside our risk, even if we don't have it as internal.
EndUser: So there's a real opportunity to use [ORG-2] more broadly than just customer facing.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, kind of be your intranet, if you will, and employee portals.
EndUser: That's a common use case here.
Agent: Partner portals as well, you know, partners and distributors. We can. allow them to have their own interface through a partner
[ORG-9] as well. Cool. Okay.
Agent: Yeah, let's jump into [PERSON-2]. We're going to flip over to our [ORG-10] support agent. This is [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-2] is logged into what we call the service console. This is configured specifically for his role within the [ORG-10] support.
Agent: Team.
Agent: So you can see here, he's got immediate access to relevant metrics, right?
Agent: So we can surface up these dashboards most anywhere. He's logged in by default. He logs into his homepage.
Agent: So I've got kind of a dashboard here that gives them kind of a high level visibility into metrics that are important to him. But he also wants to be able to track cases.
Agent: In this situation, he's looking at kind of the general Q, but he could look at a, you know, more personalized list of cases as well. We can start surfacing up other information.
Agent: Whether it's order information, sales information, events, tasks, and stuff that might be relevant for him [DATE-1] or [DATE-2] . is all configurable . configurable based on what we call our component based architecture .
Agent: Each of these little tiles like this analytics tile, this omnital on the top right, this case is tile or related list tile . are individual components . that can be used to design the experience for our service agents.
Agent: In fact, I'm not going to dip into it now, but theoretically, if someone like [PERSON-2] had admin privileges, go in, click on edit page.
Agent: That's going to take take him to the page editor, and that's where he would see a whole library of components, both standard components as well as custom components that he can then use to design this interface for himself, or if he's an admin for other folks on the team.
Agent: So, highly, highly configurable based on this, our component-based architecture. You'll notice up here too, he's got [ORG-13], similar that we saw with [PERSON-1]. Google-like search allows him to search across all... the relevant [ORG-4] that's available to him.
Agent: It's been made available to him through his permissions and his profile that his admin manages. And you'll notice here he has access to those objects as well through a nav menu.
Agent: So we'll be spending most of our time looking at cases and managing cases, but obviously he can get it to other relevant information, whether it's business accounts, customer contact records, We can extend this to bring in data.
Agent: You know, this is obviously a platform underneath all this. So we can bring in data from core systems, whether it's [LAW-1] or [ORG-13] or otherwise.
Agent: So if you've got maybe a separate core order management system, we can integrate into those systems and make sure that our service agents and others have access to those relevant data records. like click the question.
Agent: Sorry, you said that I just turned to the graph on the left, there was a, uh, there was the task is what is it?
Agent: What is the task in this context?
Agent: I'm not the task of the core object.
Agent: Yeah, it's not being populated, but think of, you know, actually, Like in a support situation, you might have a backline engineer that needs to go research some area of a product in support of a support case, right?
Agent: So you can assign that person a task, give that task a due date, and then they can then go ahead and complete that task.
Agent: And you can track the progress of that task all from obviously this through the console, but also within the context of the case that it's associated with. So tasks are... like many assignments if you will.
Agent: So you've got case objects, you've got task objects, there are any other sort of, I assume it's a bunch of objects and you don't want to go through all of them, but any other key ones that they will there.
Agent: Yeah, I mean the core objects, you think of [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: It's going to be accounts, it's going to be customer contacts, it's going to be cases, Marketing campaigns, Tasks and calendar events are all pretty standard.
Agent: We do have our own orders and order management system, but oftentimes customers already have pre-existing systems that we'll hook into products. So these are obviously products and services that we're selling. You'll see a reference to assets.
Agent: Asset are those products that have been purchased and are owned by the customer. Right. I think we have different analytics to that would be kind of represent objects as well.
Agent: When you talk about events, is that, again, just within the context of the system, what does it do things like integrate it out of the whole other systems?
Agent: What is an event?
Agent: It does integrate.
Agent: Well, an event is like a calendar event, a meeting, right?
Agent: Yeah. Okay. That would be kind of a basic example. A webinar could eventually potentially be an event as well. So think about a meeting. That's that sort of calendar event.
EndUser: And yes, we do have folks into Outlook. Gmail as well, and others. Yeah, thank you. This for dropping. Lost my network. Actually for a second. Just quick one on the global search.
EndUser: I don't know if I managed to get through but
Agent: A lot, the global search.
Agent: Does that search cross all object types or can you types you're trying to search across?
EndUser: Control what object So, yes, the organization. So, yeah, if I wanted
Agent: To filter on just cases, I could select cases. And I could. Yes. Now I'm late.
Agent: Ok. Any questions?
EndUser: Moving along
Agent: Into cases here. So we mentioned we can take those inbound cases from any channel. We can route them to the appropriate queues. So unlike [PERSON-7], we can have one or multiple queues.
Agent: Here we could have just a general queue of all of our open cases. In fact, we could see that case. It just came in from [PERSON-1], from the web.
Agent: We can view into these cues using what we call list views. So this is a list of all cases across essentially all cues. coming in from all channels like you see here. Whoops.
Agent: And these list views themselves are pretty standard. They're essentially can be cloned and templated, but you can also give customers the ability to create their own or refine their list views
EndUser: List views to meet their specific needs. So I just saw [ORG-14] here. [ORG-14] here.
Agent: Can you manage ticket statuses by dragging between [ORG-14] queues?
Agent: Yeah, that's exactly. In fact, I didn't set this up, but let me see if I use this and I do status and I click save. Give me [TIME-3].
Agent: I hadn't touched this part, so it's going to take a little bit of time, but it'll bring up a [ORG-14] view and you're going to see all your cases broken out by case status.
Agent: I can see here along the top.
Agent: And now as I'm looking at this sort of high level view, I decide that, oh, I need to pull some of these from the working queue and to an escalated queue by doing that or even a closed queue.
Agent: We could then fire off as we have escalation and assignment roles or escalation triggers that once I switch it to an escalated. status based upon let's say the case type, maybe even the customer or the customer type.
Agent: Notifications going to be sent out, tasks could be automatically triggered and generated. And we could even reassign this to maybe an escalated queue or a team of experts that manage these types of escalated cases.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So by updating status of cases, whether it's doing through a [ORG-14] view, a ListView or even within the case record itself, we can trigger follow up actions and oftentimes those
EndUser: Could
Speaker 4: Involve escalation triggers as well. And those statuses are configurable, they're cool, cool elements. No.
Agent: They're highly configurable.
EndUser: So you can
Agent: Have different statuses or kind of, yeah, cycle could be different
EndUser: Let's say the life based upon the different types of cases, right?
EndUser: It's not highly configurable.
EndUser: I might be a better question to ask, is there anything in the [ORG-2] cloud service that is, you know, sacroton, changed?
Agent: Hardwired and can't be So, what?
EndUser: Is there anything like that?
EndUser: You'd be hard
Agent: Pressed two find it. Yeah, most everything you're seeing here is configurable. Yeah, OK. Yeah. OK. So we talked a little about these list views.
Agent: You know, I can sort, obviously, right?
Agent: I can configure these and make them my own.
Agent: And I could create these cues, you know, we can have cues specific to product types. You could have tier Qs, so you have like a tier one support, as opposed to tier two or back end tier three.
Agent: And all those Qs can be automatically populated with cases based upon the routing rules, right?
Agent: We've got what we call our on-day channel routing, combined with our flows engine, that Workflow engine that I mentioned before, that allows us to create very, very complex and comprehensive
EndUser: Routing rules and routing logic. Yeah, so in fact, it won't ruin your flow, but it just this trigger to a bad memory.
EndUser: We got a tax from somewhere Somebody pushed large amounts of cases into our service by constantly spamming an email box.
Agent: Else in the world.
EndUser: I assume there are I won't say IP, but there are address
Agent: Restrictions and things that we can protect our service desk from. Yes, yep, they're definitely about the practices to help prevent against that. You can lock down to the well, and restrict who can access, IP address as
EndUser: And even some of the cases, yes.
EndUser: And are we able to pick the channels by client?
EndUser: So we're currently trying to educate some of our clients that like traditional methods on in life.
Agent: To move
EndUser: So we want to, for the majority, start with those being not allowed, and then for those that we're trying to educate, we give them a bit more time.
EndUser: So can we control the channels at a client level, or is it really at an instance level?
Agent: You can control... the channels at the client level, oftentimes that's done through like service right?
EndUser: Level agreements, those can be contractually
Agent: And those right, bound.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, the customer knows what they're signed up for and and often cases there might be paying additional fees for those support services or it can be, you know, sort of behind the scenes internal SLAs
EndUser: That you can set up as well.
EndUser: Yeah, so those things you've just touched upon the SLAs by client that is quite important to us and it's something that we we're currently going through actually right now we've got about about 10 different SLAs for various different ages of contracts types of client services we provide and it becomes a filtration system.
EndUser: So you apply rules and I see it was always your rules but up to each other. You should never have a ticket not dropping into one of them.
Agent: But I assume it's the same
EndUser: Sort of thing. You just define your rules to pick up the [ORG-14] and obviously
Agent: You have a catch all at the bottom. Yes. Yep. You can define, you can attach your routing logic to SLAs. Essentially...
Agent: Slas can be evaluated as routing logic.
EndUser: Part of the Yeah.
Agent: Once you'll see it as we get further into the demo here, we'll get into account record. If they count record, we can see if they have a service contract and what their SLAs are.
Agent: And in fact, in [TIME-4] here, when I open up the case, We can also provide through a little entitlement's widget.
Agent: We can allow the agents, into what those SLAs are, what those milestones are, and they can start to kind of proactively manage those milestones.
EndUser: Immediate visibility
Agent: You'll see that forthcoming. But yeah, we have full service contracts, entitlements. Those are distinct objects within the system and can be configured, obviously, to meet your
EndUser: Business processes and... all the way down to the account associated products as well.
Agent: Level SLAs contracts. We can have those
EndUser: And service operations [TIME-5] as well. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Agent: Because
EndUser: One of the things we're currently looking at is potentially offering different service hours for certain things.
Agent: Maybe even for certain clients, so it will be rules driven. So, okay, good.
EndUser: I mean,
Agent: We have, I mean, customers like [ORG-14], right, is a big service-pelt customer. And I think they've got over 10,000 users deployed globally. [ORG-14] is also a very large Service Cloud user, [ORG-21].
EndUser: So these are large, you 101 companies that are all deployed on Service Cloud globally.
Agent: Know, not even, these are [WORK_OF_ART-1]: So it's definitely enterprise-grade.
Agent: Yeah, I get the point. We should stop asking about features because they're going to be there. That's fine. No, no, I mean, I definitely that's what I'm here for is the answer to questions.
Agent: And it's helpful to know what's important. Yeah, thank you. So I mentioned the routing.
Agent: What we can also do is we will typically set up our agents with their own profiles, right?
Agent: So I as [PERSON-2] have certain skills, maybe on a expert and certain products. I'm also available across maybe one or multiple channels. And once I make myself available, the system's going to know that, oh, [PERSON-2] is now available.
Agent: We know a skill set. Let's start sending him one or even multiple cases for him to manage. So here we'll have an inbound case review. We see the one that's coming in from [PERSON-1] earlier.
Agent: We can set this up so he has kind of a high level view into some summary level information. He can accept that case. And I'm going to go ahead and put myself at a busy status here.
Agent: And we're going to bring up the case. So this is a detailed case record. It's designed so that our service agents like [PERSON-2] can quickly get to the information they need.
Agent: You can see it's there's such a, this design, of course, it's component based. So you can kind of lay it out however you like.
Agent: But typically we like to have sort of the case content, the details, as well as customer and account information and history listed here along the left. So I can quickly kind of wrap my head around.
Agent: Who this customer is, what this case is about, if there's any sort of a history of similar cases, those can all be service stuff or if there's active sales opportunities like you see here in the bottom left, those can also be service stuff.
Agent: Notice here in the middle, this is where I can start to take action, right?
Agent: That action could be responding in email. It could be collaborating through what we call like a case swarm.
Agent: If I want to bring in multiple folks, make them aware of this case and have them assist me in resolving this case, I can generate a case swarm which I'll show you here in [TIME-4].
Agent: I can always dip into the details of the case and related records. Again, other cases.
Agent: Anytime we're managing interactions, whether it's a phone call or a chat or an SMS message, those transcripts can also be captured as part of the case.
Agent: And of course, much of this case data can be rolled up into the account in the contact record.
Agent: Files and so forth survey are all native to the platform so we can capture those survey responses and the context of the cases. I can initiate a slack.
Agent: Swarm which I'll show you here in a bit and we can also provide [ORG-14] and do other systems such as [PRODUCT-3]. This is just a bit of a placeholder.
Agent: If I click on it, you'll see I just put in some fields here but typically what you would see is the ability to maybe search JIRA for related bugs, right?
Agent: Or if I identify the bug as part of my Case Management process, I could create a new bug and have that be managed within [PRODUCT-3]. All right. There are standard connectors to systems like [GPE-2]: And that's going to allow for that sort of bi-directional Integration into those systems.
Agent: Moving to the right, we have some tools, right?
Agent: So we have the ability to proactively manage to any milestones based upon the service level agreements. that are associated with this account.
Agent: So this is just sort of a, kind of showcases how I as an agent know which are my milestones that are forthcoming.
Agent: If a milestone has been maybe breached or exceeded, I can send out notifications and alert the appropriate people. I can maybe even drive automated escalations based upon those either missed or upcoming milestones.
Agent: Next best action is essentially the ability to evaluate the contact and the context and the progress of the case and recommend to your agent maybe certain steps that they should take, right?
Agent: So maybe if this is a specific troubleshooting issue, all right, or a case for a particular product, we could recommend the agent step through a series of troubleshooting steps. All right, in this case, it's somewhat generic.
Agent: We've just identified that this is loyal customer.
Agent: As we have them on the line, there might be some additional information that we wanna share either through email or if they're on chat or phone call, we could share it with them real time.
Agent: And of course, we've got our knowledge base, right?
Agent: So as this case is progressing, as we're making
EndUser: Updates to this case, this little knowledge widget's evaluating the context of the case and always surfs seeing up relevant knowledge articles. Couple of quick five questions for you. Yeah. I'd like to see the audit history of this case.
EndUser: Who's updated what field, when, what events have triggered, and
Agent: Also I assume there is a full audit trail of every event that end user or client or our applied.
EndUser: System or own agent has Yeah.
Agent: I mean, underneath this, we have our record logs that are extremely detailed. Yeah. OK. I don't feel like any specific feed updates. This is the case feed. This is configurable.
Agent: So you kind of need to let the system know important view .
Agent: But typically, we want to know who opened it and when, who's made any updates to the status, if there's been any emails or chats or even posts or collaboration with a customer or even internal collaboration, such as [GPE-3], all that's going to be captured in nice clean chronological
EndUser: Order here within the case speed. Okay. I guess I've seen, for example, automations that have failed in the background and been able to see which as well.
Agent: Automations were triggered.
EndUser: So yeah, I guess so, yes. Yeah, fine. And then the next one is around, I guess, more the [ORG-14] side of things.
EndUser: So if we want to create a problem from this ticket because maybe they're raising, you know, a systems down type ticket, how can I trigger effectively a problem ticket?
EndUser: And then from there, move some of my activities for not only this case, but other cases
Agent: That might have already come in. for that problem. So you're getting into resolution, management process, which is fully supported by [ORG-20].
EndUser: Incident problem,
Agent: Those are distinct objects. That kind of use case isn't something within this demo environment, but it's- Not okay, it is there.
EndUser: That's configured but it's there. So it's there.
Agent: Yes, I know I'd actually call so anything. Okay. No, no. We typically, yeah, no, but like you mentioned, I tell, I mean, if you're looking for a solution that's. I tell certified.
Agent: We typically work through partners to provide that we have it till. solutions that have been designed on the platform and that are available. But if you're looking to do just maybe more lightweight problem
EndUser: Resolution management, that's all standard and that is all part of service. I'll give you an example. [DATE-3] it still hurts. We had an outage that affected [PERCENT-1] of our clients in one go.
EndUser: The ticket started coming in thick and fast. Our ability to communicate to the clients was stretched to say the least.
EndUser: And I'm looking for how this solution could allow me to proactively go out to clients, as well as answer the ones that have already fed in, but very quickly connect things without having to fill in 20 fields to classify a problem and whatnot.
Agent: So I'm just looking for an opportunity to make that kind of catastrophic event less painful. We have tools that allow you to kind of evaluate that sort of situation.
Agent: In flag-solar cases and even present them in a list like this, you could then take those cases, identify that yes they are related and you could then relate them to a and kind of go down that problem or incident problem resolution process.
EndUser: Problem
EndUser: Again, within [ORG-20].
Agent: That's all standard
Agent: Yes, so I just don't I don't have any of that turned on if you will. That's fine. That's fine. Yeah, and you know that's a good point because I mean, [PERSON-8], we can just make note of that.
Agent: We can follow up.
Agent: I'm sure we probably have demo videos that would that address that particular use case if you're if you want to take a closer look, right?
EndUser: Some
Agent: Yeah. So keep it with the case here. You'll notice here, you know, AI or what we like to call [PERSON-9]. That's kind of how we branded our [PRODUCT-4] capabilities on the platform. [PERSON-9] has already started assisting us.
Agent: It's through the use of machine learning and in particular classification model. It is evaluating this inbound case and providing recommendations. So this is a way to help automate. and assist our agents in that initial triage of the case.
Agent: You think about it when a new case comes in, you know, if you've got subject, they got a description, maybe some other details that are then provided through the web form, but then they need to determine well, what type of cases is this?
Agent: Is there a subtype?
Agent: Is there a particular product family case reason or so forth?
Agent: We can use [PRODUCT-4] and machine learning to based upon our very rich history of closed cases to evaluate this case and use that classification model and make these these recommendations.
Agent: So we're essentially automating that initial triage process or helping to automate. So I can evaluate kind of what [PERSON-9] is recommending and I can go ahead and save it.
Agent: As I save it and I update the case, we can based upon that new updated case, start dynamically presenting next best actions like you see here on the right or other [ORG-4] as well. All right.
Agent: Additionally, I can go in and as I'm sort of, Continuing to kind of wrap my head around this case, I could dip into the customer record, or we like to call the C392, the customer 391.
Agent: I can see their whole history of maybe product orders.
Agent: I can, you know, based upon this customer, we can also recommend actions to be taken within the context of the customer, which is what you see here in the bottom left. I've got related records as well.
Agent: So I can see at the customer level, other cases that they've submitted, the status of those cases, assets that they currently own. Maybe there's a particular asset product.
Agent: I can see when it was purchased, whether or not it's under warranty. I could even dip in further at the product level or the asset level, the C related cases and so forth.
Agent: So what you can see is very quickly, as I'm moving from the case, I can open up the customer record, I can open up asset records, all those are being presented in very efficient manner through this sort of a tab display.
Agent: So you have a parent tab and sub-tabs that allow me to quickly move through these records, get to the
EndUser: Information I need, get back to the case and continue to work to resolve it.
EndUser: Just in terms of this kind of collaborative effect, If an end user raises a ticket with us first time, they might have just arrived at the organization. They've just effectively created an account by emailing us with a problem.
EndUser: Let's say they're not known to our [ORG-2].
EndUser: When we save a case, does that add that person to the organization in [ORG-2]?
EndUser: And are we then allowed to kind of to our sales team?
Agent: Connect that
EndUser: I guess there's some Workflow in there, but it'd be really nice for us to actually comment on whether they're an influencer, a director, or whatever and compliment the work that the sales and the account management team are doing.
EndUser: I assume that's how it works, is that if we create a contact
Agent: From the very first time, it goes into the standard area. It's going to evaluate to see if this customer already exists. Typically, it's looking at the email address. There could be other that you'd use to evaluate.
EndUser: Criteria
Agent: If the system thinks they already exist, it'll present you with a short list of one or maybe multiple obviously don't want to create duplicate records.
[ORG-21] that you don't
Agent: So you want to take that case and attach it to the relevant existing record or a new case or Yeah.
EndUser: You can be prompted to create a new record, excuse me.
Agent: Okay. Yeah. And You know, over time as you're interacting with that customer and this customer record becomes built out. And obviously this, like everything else is configurable.
Agent: You can see they're kind of their customer history, which would also include, I think it's in here, any opportunities, active opportunities, those can also be serviced up within the the customer record.
Agent: You can also see here I've opened up the account.
Agent: So similar to a customer 392, we have the account 392, a little bit of a different layout, just to give you a kind of a feel for how we can design these record detail layouts.
Agent: But I can look at who the contacts are for this account, convex insurance.
Agent: I can look at sales, right?
Agent: Sales opportunities orders, service cases and so forth. filling and so forth. And this is also where you might see some additional tabs.
Agent: Maybe it's an [ORG-13] tab or an SAP tab or something that you could then use to kind of dip into relevant. data and records that are coming from course systems. All right.
Agent: One last thing too, over here on the far right, I'm opening up bin sites. Now as I'm rapidly jumping around, so I apologize for that. We're back in the case record.
Agent: On the far right here, I click on the Insights tab. This customer insights, this is what I mentioned before.
Agent: So as part of the context of this case, I can see what [PERSON-1] was doing prior to submitting this case.
Agent: So if you was viewing a knowledge-based article or open up any sort of training videos or technical articles, I can see that and that can help me, again, provide a more relevant experience as I start
EndUser: To collaborate with her. I'm sure so, team your demo.
Agent: Probably
EndUser: If you can close a case, is there a case closure, [PERSON-10] at all?
Agent: So what we call case wrap, yes. Similar but on the back end of that case lifecycle.
EndUser: To a case classification,
Agent: So if you've got some, you know, It can recommend how to disposition the case, I guess. So it can recommend field values. We can even use next best action to recommend or take them through maybe a disposition process.
Agent: We also have the concept of a macros. I know I believe you guys are using this. It's a common tool. It's very within [LOC-1]. Same with Service Cloud here.
Agent: If I need to close out a case, that's another method that I could use to help. automate those final I guess one
EndUser: Steps and the disposition of the case.
EndUser: Yeah, of the hopes I would have, and maybe this is too much of a problem, but it is some kind of summary of the case, both a public facing summary and an internal facing summary.
EndUser: So all the updates kind of collated to say, well, this case went through this journey, and here's a summary of and then the non-public perspective.
Agent: It from a public perspective
EndUser: And potentially because that summary is quite useful, it could be then promoted to an article.
Agent: Yes, yes. In fact, when I close out this case, so I have a quick example of how we can capture case information and recommend the creation of an article and even step through the creation of that article.
Agent: So yes, that's a common sort of process. In regards to case summaries, Stay tuned. I mean, maybe in a follow-up conversation, I can show that to you.
Agent: We do have, as part of our initial set of [PERSON-9]'s [ORG-23] features, what we call case summaries.
Agent: So if it's the cases within an email or a chat we can provide summaries, essentially, evaluate the case, summarize the case, and present it back to the to the agent.
EndUser: Channel,
Agent: We can then take those case summaries. We can do whatever you want, which you can include them in notifications internally. We can send them back out as an email or automatic to share them with the customer.
EndUser: We can have them created as for posterity as part of the case record itself. So we do have this, this concept of case summaries, it's relatively new just within [DATE-4].
Agent: This
EndUser: We've released it. I'd love to look at that, even if that was in some kind of offline method. And there's a couple of concerns I have, obviously, apart from the usual, about just randomly picking stuff up.
EndUser: But our cases have a lot of SQL or very technical language, like or.
Agent: Stack traces
EndUser: You know instructions on how to install something. So when these case summaries come up, the last thing you want is for some SQL to be embedded in the words.
EndUser: So it's really interesting to see that and the intelligence of it. Once you see how good it is as an engine, then you can put it in anywhere in the process. So we're quite
Agent: Interested to say that one offline. Yeah [PERSON-6], we did have a few slides that we were originally planning to walk through on that [DATE-1], but we'll probably run out of time for that [DATE-1].
Agent: But that's definitely something that we want to walk through with you for the case summary. And then even the knowledge article creation too, I heard you mentioned that.
Agent: So we can schedule, send them in the meantime, and then schedule more time to walk through the generative
EndUser: Features that would benefit the risk.
Agent: Yeah. And we are running out of time. We got [TIME-6] here. So I'm going to kind of fast tracking this, but just want to show you some of the other capabilities.
Agent: I talked about the ability to collaborate, right?
Agent: So we can do that several different ways. We can post back to the customer out to the community. So here I just threw this little post tool.
Agent: I did a quick cut and paste from Knowledge article and I'm sharing that relevant information with [PERSON-1]. Of course, if [PERSON-1] comes Backup here, we open up her case, which I would find within her account. Sorry.
Agent: And right there. And there you go. So you can see, we can, you know, we can, we can collaborate with them within the community. We can also collaborate with them. through SMS as well as email.
Agent: In fact, I don't have SMS turned on, but typically if you need to initiate a conversation, you'll see a little button up here that says start conversation. And that could initiate an SMS back.
Agent: If they were if they opted into that SMS messaging, I can also create emails, right?
Agent: So I take this, we've got email templates, I can take an entire knowledge article or even snippets of [ORG-4] from a knowledge article, I could attach it in.
Agent: So here I can attach an entire body of an article into an email. And I could send that along as well. So just some couple quick examples. I didn't get into specifics of email templates.
Agent: Email templates are becoming more and more automated. So we can traditionally consider sort of an out of box or a library of templates. Those are becoming much more dynamic.
Agent: Now with Einstein GPT, we're moving the direction where we can dynamically start displaying or providing relevant and very personalized email templates using generative [PRODUCT-4].
Agent: You're also going to start seeing that with Knowledge Articles themselves, where we can sort of consolidate or use [PERSON-13], [ORG-20], to pull information across knowledge-based articles and then create a summary response back to the customer.
Agent: Kind of a hybrid knowledge-based article.
Agent: Do you capture how long agents are spending on cases and safety activities?
Agent: Yeah, we do at a high level.
Agent: So think about these statuses, right?
Agent: So we can track how much time is spent in the status. We can track the entire time of the lifecycle from the time it was open to the time it was closed.
Agent: If you want to get more granular and you want to look at their actual like detailed case tracking, like the time that they have the case record open in front of them and they're actively working at.
Agent: Those case tracking tools are provided through through partners through our app exchange.
EndUser: So that would be an example of a kind of an app, if you will, that could be downloaded from our app exchange
Agent: And quickly integrated into your Service Cloud deployment. I know seeing most of those are charged, obviously, to the integrator. So there's next to it. Yes. Oftentimes we have our own.
Agent: Like you'll see on their label that have been designed by [ORG-20]. And oftentimes Right, but um, okay, the better
EndUser: Those are going to be free.
Agent: Ones usually
EndUser: All have an additional cost. So, yeah, of course they do. Yeah. That's fine.
EndUser: It's that it's looking like is that way something we all have is something when we save a case, you can edit it with the amount of time you've spent on it, both manually and it defaults to the amount of time you've had the case open for.
Speaker 4: So you can put a negative number in just to discount any time that you've officially used. I use it quite heavily.
Speaker 4: So for service requests, for example, it's quite important to me to understand how much high-meage service requests is taking different categories of service requests.
Agent: I'm not just how on the tickets being opened, but how long it's taking the agent to service that request.
Speaker 4: Okay, but you were saying you had to manually update it?
Speaker 4: Is that what you were saying?
Agent: Well, no, it guesses, right?
Agent: So it'll go, I think you've spent [TIME-7], but then the agent has the ability
EndUser: To overwrite that and say, no, actually, it was <inaudible>.
EndUser: Okay, is that something that's [DATE-1] or is that?
Agent: Out of the box with [ORG-20]: In the same way that [PERSON-6] described it, it's a marketplace. I've been in this case, but obviously
Agent: There are other versions of it for Zendes that you can pay all sorts for extra features.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, we can send a couple of those examples then to you. And while we're talking here, I just trying to fire off a macro. It looks like. It's not, oh, there it goes, all right.
Agent: So what you're seeing here is just the ability to automate a process. Typically within our case lifecycle, we might have these processes such as closing a case or maybe escalating a case.
Agent: Those sorts of processes, we need to spawn maybe some additional tasks and assign those tasks out. Maybe they would involve the response back to a customer through email or other channel of choice.
Agent: Those sorts of sort of standard workflows within the context of the case can be automated through the use of a macro. Here I just close it out.
Agent: What you would typically see is that the case has now been closed. Notifications have been sent out internally as well as externally. We can attach an email.
Agent: We can even conduct a search and attach the relevant article automatically to that. To that case and have it part of the response back out to the customer. And of course, if I go back here to [PERSON-1].
Agent: And I open up [PERSON-1]'s inbox. You're going to see that she's got some email notifications, including a closed case survey. So surveys is also part of our platform. She can respond back.
Agent: Oftentimes, she can respond back within the context of the email, or if it's more detailed survey, we can bring her out to the survey web page.
Agent: All this can be branded specific to, obviously, kind of look and feel and we can have her provide her feedback . capture the survey feedback.
Agent: Again, if it's like a low [ORG-20] score or something like that, the system's got the ability through Workflow engine to alert the appropriate people and kind of start automating the follow-up steps to maybe a negative [ORG-20] score.
Agent: Going back out to [ORG-20], within the context of the case, and even the agent record itself, we can go in and we can even look at these survey responses.
Agent: As you would see here, we can look at the individual responses all the way down to the question level. Okay. So surveys
Agent: Is core.
Agent: What else?
Agent: Oh. And the surveys, these two [PERSON-6], I think you're part of the [ORG-32] for the medalia. Looking at feedback management. So yeah, that kicked off [DATE-5].
EndUser: So hopefully you have the credentials to be able
Agent: To play around with that too.
Agent: Last thing we leave you with before I give you a [TIME-8] nickel tour of analytics is swarming, right?
Agent: So this is the ability internally. Let's say we have a very complex case or something that's going to require multiple individuals to assist. we can create what we call a case swarm.
Agent: We're using [ORG-35] collaboration tool to manage these swarms.
Agent: But essentially what I'm doing here is I can initiate a swarm and I can request that this either be attached to an existing [ORG-35] thread or what we call a channel or a new channel.
Agent: Let's create a new one. And we're going to say this is claim server.
Agent: Issue and this sort of Workflow is going to prompt us, do we want to add in specific members or do we want the system to find experts to assist us with this case.
Agent: I'm just going to add in [PERSON-13] who's the account manager and I'm going to add in my colleagues [PERSON-14] and [PERSON-14] and I'm going to create this form. Now, a swarm record has been created.
Agent: If I go over here over to [ORG-35], it should show up. My slide. Sorry, just integrate with [ORG-32] supposed to slide.
Agent: So, yes, there are connectors out there for Teams, right?
Agent: It's not as comprehensive. It's not as tightly integrated as you're going to find with [ORG-35]. But yes, we do have some. some actually I got a quick finisher. We do have some Integration capabilities with teams.
Agent: Now that I clicked on finish, I can go out here I think to [ORG-35], you're going to see the swarm.
Agent: I could even click on the URL, it's going to take me out to my [ORG-35], and this is where folks like [PERSON-3] or other folks that may or may not be working in [ORG-2], maybe they spend most of their time within [ORG-35] and they can.
Agent: Use Slack as their primary tool by which they're managing accounts and customers Right?
EndUser: As well as cases.
Agent: I can view a case just like I could view other records within [ORG-2]. I can do that all within my Slack environment.
Agent: I can start collaborating with my colleagues and asking them questions, sharing documentation, and so forth, all within [ORG-35].
Agent: So this is the ability to get multiple people to collaborate and swarm around a case, share information, and ultimately hopefully close out that case.
EndUser: Sorry, I'm coming out to rapid fire as well. That's fine. You've got to go. That was a great demo. And threads to follow up on.
Agent: There's obviously a few more
EndUser: The Slack one is one that we definitely need to think about because that's not of choice.
Agent: Our chosen tool
EndUser: Yeah, it's been a great demo. I think it's really highlighted some of the differences. and the Workflow in particular is one I feel that is a strong point.
EndUser: Obviously there's governance and who would have the rights to do what and and what aspects should be centrally controlled and what aspects would be locally controlled. There's a big discussion to be had there but not for here.
EndUser: That's a more of a one-virus concept. But yeah, that was great. That was an awesome demo. I think we, yeah.
Agent: Yeah. Good. I'm glad you found it helpful. You got a good baseline understanding of kind of what service thought has to offer. Hopefully I've convinced you at least with this intro demo that there's a lot we can do.
Agent: It definitely is Enterprise grade and can meet and exceed your capabilities on the Zendes. And look forward to any follow up questions in conversation.
Agent: So definitely let's look at [PERSON-8] and happy to go deeper into any of these elements that I shared with you [DATE-1]. Or if you have other questions, let's feel free to
EndUser: Schedule you.
Agent: A follow up conversation.
Agent: Thank I think there was more on that we wanted to show too, right?
EndUser: [PERSON-6],
Agent: The analytics
Agent: So I'll just
EndUser: Follow up. So I'm on my phone swinging. That's what the noise is. Sorry. Yeah, no, that would be great. Yeah, start of
Speaker 5: It's definitely this is the
Agent: A few ideas, right?
Agent: Thank you so much for that. Thank you very much. Thank you, [PERSON-8]. Yeah, thanks everybody for joining. [PERSON-6], I know that we wanted to go through some of the high level pricing and then also this.
EndUser: Next steps and scheduling some of
Agent: Do you have a hard stop right now or should we just reconnecting [DATE-6]?
EndUser: Yeah, could we reconnect this way?
EndUser: Yeah, I really I think
Agent: Was a lot of time waiting for you [DATE-1]. So, yeah. you were right there in half, one of them. And it probably [TIME-9]. I know, I'm glad that I updated it.
Agent: Ok, well then let's point and we can talk about scheduling any follow-ups.
EndUser: So I'll just send an invite for works for you or what you do.
Agent: [DATE-7] [TIME-10], if that
EndUser: Yeah, I'll
Speaker 5: Give you some times for my blog. OK.
EndUser: Good. Thanks, guys. I need to dive off the camera. Thanks, [PERSON-14]. Thanks, guys. You've prepared the time. Okay, [DATE-6] I can do
Agent: [TIME-13] my time so that'll be what's [TIME-13], 8am your time?
Agent: Okay, [TIME-13], yes that could work.
EndUser: Is that the only time?
EndUser: Yeah, we probably don't want to do [TIME-14] [DATE-6] so. Oh, all of it.
Agent: I could probably do a little bit later if it works. I can switch to another meeting out.
EndUser: I could either do [TIME-14] your time [DATE-6] your time on [DATE-8] if that worked.
Agent: Or [TIME-13]
EndUser: [DATE-8], no, let's go [TIME-14] then. Okay. Hang on, hang on.
Agent: My children's football is If it's [TIME-14], let's do 5.
EndUser: Half.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Are you sure you're not going to miss?
Agent: Yeah, no, that's fine. That's fine. I don't want you missing. football. So, okay. It's fine. Okay, it should be [TIME-14] or maybe even quicker. So let's do that [DATE-6] and then we will continue the conversation.
Agent: But yeah, thanks again for rallying the team
EndUser: Together and for the time [DATE-1]. Excellent. Thank you very much. That was awesome. Thanks, like for taking us through it and thanks [PERSON-8] for the intro. And whoever is dialed in, thank you too.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-8].
Agent: Yeah, all right.
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: Thank you. Cheers. Bye bye.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer seemed to feel that the seller's product has the potential to meet their needs, particularly in terms of Workflow and capabilities that exceed their current state. However, they also expressed a need to replace their current system with the new one, and there were discussions about governance, rights, and central vs. local control that suggest further conversations are needed to ensure the product aligns with their specific requirements.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current capabilities and how they compare to the seller's product. The customer mentions that their current capabilities are ""virtually identical"" to the seller's product, but the seller insists that their product is ""much more powerful."" The seller could have asked more questions to understand the specific ways in which the customer's current capabilities fall short in order to make a more compelling case for their product.
2. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's use of communities and peer-to-peer sharing. The customer mentions that they have not used this feature and are not sure if they would benefit from it. The seller could have asked more questions about the customer's current support processes and how they might be improved by incorporating communities and peer-to-peer sharing.
3. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's service level agreements (SLAs) and how they are currently managed. The customer mentions that they have multiple SLAs for different types of contracts and services, and that they are currently going through a process of filtering tickets into these different SLAs. The seller could have asked more questions about the specifics of this process and how the seller's product might be able to automate or streamline it.
4. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's incident and problem resolution processes. The customer mentions that they had a major outage that affected a large portion of their clients and that they are looking for a way to manage incidents and problems more effectively. The seller could have asked more questions about the customer's current processes and how the seller's product might be able to support or improve them.
5. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's use of Slack and how it might be integrated with the seller's product. The customer mentions that Slack is their ""chosen tool"" for managing accounts and customers, and that they would like to be able to view and collaborate on cases within Slack. The seller could have asked more questions about the customer's current use of Slack and how it might be integrated with the seller's product to provide a seamless support experience.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions were aimed at understanding the customer's needs, current pain points, and requirements. Here are some examples:

1. ""What are your main challenges with your current state?""
2. ""What are your expectations from the new system?""
3. ""How do you see this solution fitting into your existing workflows?""
4. ""What kind of improvements are you looking for in your support process?""
5. ""Are there any specific features or functionalities you're interested in?""

These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs and tailor the demonstration accordingly, focusing on the aspects that matter the most to the customer.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have provided a clearer and more concise introduction of the company and its product, outlining the key benefits and differentiators.
2. The sales rep could have done a better job of addressing the customer's pain points and how the product can solve them. While the rep did mention some features of the product, they could have more explicitly linked those features to the customer's specific needs.
3. The sales rep could have provided more concrete examples of how other customers have successfully implemented and benefited from the product. This would have helped the customer better understand the potential value of the product for their own organization.
4. The sales rep could have done a better job of highlighting the unique features and capabilities of the product, as compared to competitors. While the rep did mention some differences between the product and Zendesk, they could have more strongly emphasized the advantages of the product.
5. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep could have provided a clearer summary of the key takeaways and next steps, to ensure that the customer was left with a clear understanding of the product and its value proposition.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So you'll notice here in the bottom right, You know, our Service Cloud in our platform is multi channel or we like to call on the channel. So at any point in time, if a customer such as [PERSON-1] wants to escalate into a live channel, such as a chat or even a phone call, they may be wanting to do some Messaging through a WhatsApp or SMS, all that's available to them as well.""

   The customer seemed more engaged as they asked a follow-up question about abandoned web forms and capturing how often people use them.

2. ""So, you know, that's what we like to refer to as peer-to-peer service. Sharing of ideas would be another way where we can have customers maybe submit enhancement requests. We can tag those enhancement requests and track them, you know, for other folks to view and maybe even vote on. And then based upon the popularity of those ideas, we might even work those into our product roadmap.""

   The customer asked if they capture how often people use these and if they can track abandoned web forms. They also asked if they can get granular with website analytics tools.

3. ""So, yeah, I mean, customers like [ORG-14], right, is a big service-pelt customer. And I think they've got over 10,000 users deployed globally. [ORG-14] is also a very large Service Cloud user, [ORG-21]. So these are large, you 101 companies that are all deployed on Service Cloud globally.""

   The customer asked if they can control the channels at a client level and if they can set up SLAs by client. They also mentioned that they have about 10 different SLAs for various different ages of contracts and types of client services they provide.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or who the correct person would be if they were not. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call."
video_19757_167_6qr3y000000odwrAAA,"Agent: And [PERSON-1], maybe if you have them ready, you know, the intro slides, I know I think I threw that at you, you have them ready, we could show them now if you wanted to just kind of explain who you are when you kind of do a quick intro.
Agent: But I'm joined [ORG-1] by a colleague on the [PRODUCT-1] team, [PERSON-2], who is a solutions engineer.
Agent: [PERSON-3], you want to just quickly introduce yourself?
Agent: Absolutely.
Agent: And like yourself, I'm also a little bit under the weather. currently battling COVID, but I'm definitely on the tail end. I'm based here in [GPE-1]. I've been with [ORG-2] for going on [DATE-1].
Agent: I've been part of the [PRODUCT-2] Cloud product team for [DATE-2] and came to [ORG-2] originally from a sustainability startup.
Agent: So I've kind of had this relatively long background in sustainability and a lot of depth of knowledge of the [ORG-2] platform. So that's why I'm here to give you a presentation [DATE-3]. Cool. Thank
EndUser: You all.
Agent: Great.
Agent: And [PERSON-1], are you ready or do you want me to buy you some time?
Agent: Yeah, maybe you could [TIME-1].
EndUser: Introduce yourself. I need probably OK,
Agent: No problem. So we're going to come back to [PERSON-1] and the deck, but [PERSON-1], why don't you just quickly introduce yourself and then we'll go through some [ORG-3] and then come back to you.
EndUser: Yeah, it's nice to meet you. My name is [PERSON-4]. I am the CEO of Green Impact. We are a Salesforce SI that exclusively focuses on net zero cloud implementations.
EndUser: And we really make sure that we tailor our implementations to our customer needs.
EndUser: We're a little bit more of a niche player, and we like to make sure that we really focus on the onboarding of the customer onto the tool. So that's a very impactful part of the implementation.
Agent: Great. Thanks, [PERSON-1]. And [PERSON-5] has been great to work with on this team. They are super nimble, very open-minded. They also create their own IP Content from things like commute management. And so they're very creative.
Agent: And I really enjoy working with them. So I can't recommend them. more highly. So in terms of [DATE-3], [ORG-1], I mean, we've kind of got an agenda of some things that we can get into.
Agent: I'll just verbally kind of give you the high level. We can do a mini intro since I didn't really show you any slides to Net Zero Cloud, a high level.
Agent: Talk a little bit about what maybe year one might look like and then [DATE-4] and beyond.
Agent: We talked a little bit about starting with a starter plan and then going to growth and I can talk you through that and the licensing costs.
Agent: What would you really like?
Agent: What's your top checklist for [DATE-3]'s conversation?
Agent: Would you say so we make sure that we cover that?
EndUser: I mean... [PERSON-6]'s not here. I didn't really realize he wasn't going to be here up until this moment when I checked the invite and it said that he declined because he's quad booked or whatever he is usually. Yep.
EndUser: And why we recorded.
Agent: That's
EndUser: Yeah. I guess I really am at the stage where I need, I have confidence that I can get the result that I need. There's no issue there, obviously very companies speaking.
Agent: Reputable
EndUser: On behalf of very reputable companies, right?
EndUser: So I don't really have any issues there per se.
EndUser: It's just like, I'm going to say it, because they say everything like this, which is like, can I afford it?
EndUser: Like that's kind of where my help goes, obviously, because there's always urgency when you're kind of late. I mean, I feel like everybody you probably talked to is late to the game on reporting and decarbonization plans and whatever.
EndUser: Like we're all playing catch up. It's just that like the conversation has to have a fiscal feasibility. Otherwise kind of like I can't it's good use of everybody's time to know that we're all in the same. Places.
Agent: You know, no, I totally understand that and look I appreciate your candor because By the way, you're in a very large group the bell curve is a lot of and Especially in [DATE-5].
EndUser: Sometimes
EndUser: Folks playing catch up
Agent: We've seen [QUANTITY-1] of Interest in that zero club because of [GPE-2] A lot of people are like boy. We got to get going [DATE-6].
Agent: So we're having a lot of boy We got to get going conversations But why don't, would it be helpful to kind of just give you a little bit of context around the platform, kind of what we're thinking will be useful.
EndUser: So you're in good company.
Agent: Yeah. [DATE-7], show you that And then we could kind of cut to the licensing costs.
EndUser: A little bit.
Agent: And [PERSON-1] could talk through some ideas he has and some questions he has about how they might be able to help.
EndUser: And maybe he can potentially, I forewarned him on this, give you a ballpark so we can kind of cut to the all-encompassing cut Does that make sense?
Agent: [ORG-4] and have an to the chase conversation.
EndUser: Yeah, trying to stall a little bit until [PERSON-7] got here for the whole UI Like I'm trying to also real-time think for her to see because I drag her along that in a couple of things.
Agent: That's fine. I don't know if I was
Agent: Experience.
EndUser: Of what's valuable And it is a bit above her. It's out of her comfort zone, but.
Agent: So let's just roll with this. It's going to be recorded. It'll take as long as it takes [PERSON-7] to See that's fine.
EndUser: See whatever she gets.
Agent: Yeah, well, we can delay the demo by time for [PERSON-3] and kind of cover some slides and talk through with [PERSON-1], you know, what you might need.
Agent: So why don't we do that?
Agent: So I'm going to just share a few slides, kind of what we're thinking high level here in terms of how we might be able to help and how the platform fits in and use a little bit of wizard behind the curtain here.
Agent: But let's just jump to like talk [DATE-8] here and.
Agent: What kind of is the value?
Agent: Because I know you're going to have to talk internally, right, about like, why do I you know, because you're so I think what you really benefit from, and I think the slide would benefit from a spell check.
EndUser: Need a platform and why,
Agent: Well-pelled management correctly, but you'll know this is a customized presentation for you is you really want to get started right and have a streamline system and secure data collection of management because this is like your foundation for everything that you slowly want to build out there at degree, right?
Agent: And you also want to build a system from the get-go that's going to be auditable, that's going to give you different ways to ensure data quality.
Agent: You also want to have a system that's going to be doing accurate calculations within the system and matching things up correctly with the right emission factors.
Agent: You're also going to get guidance from [ORG-2] and from the system in it, greater green impact and [PERSON-1] and his team. You're going to get some consultative layer of guidance. So you're not doing this all by your lonesome.
Agent: And then lastly, Lastly, you're going to get data management and a single source of truth that's goin g to hold your data for that future reporting By the way, I learned this [DATE-3]
EndUser: [PERSON-8] is now reporting in [DATE-9] instead of [DATE-10] So everyone gets [DATE-9]
Agent: To be ready for [GPE-3] .
Agent: Report
Agent: [PERSON-9], where's the [ORG-5] meets party confetti?
Agent: Thank you. Yeah, okay, great. And then if we think [DATE-13] and beyond, so let's say you start out with starter plan.
Agent: [DATE-13], you can upgrade at [DATE-14] mark, you could upgrade at the one year mark. Then [DATE-4], you think about really reporting at scale, because now [GPE-4] might matter.
Agent: Like I said with the compliance reporting hub which I can show you a little bit and [PERSON-3] can show you a little bit later .
Agent: You can really report at scale and reuse reports [DATE-13] or reuse information qualitative and quantitative across different types of reports and tag them.
Agent: And we're also going to have AI being layered in [DATE-13] that will pre populate reports.
Agent: And then we're also going to shift from the type of templates that are in there over to [ORG-6] and [ORG-7] format and make that even easier to use.
Agent: So there's a lot of really good stuff that in [DATE-13], you could really leverage in terms of reporting and that compliance hub.
Agent: You can also then, once you're assuming fingers crossed you're approved by [ORG-8], you can then be tracking your [ORG-8] targets and your progress against that. You can start to build out broader scope 3 tracking.
Agent: We can cover the 13 categories, 13 of them in a very out of the box way. Two of them require a bit of configuration. And then you can do different scenario analysis if you want to.
Agent: Question from the C suite, you can quickly kind of pivot some things and show them wha t changes that might look like . rather than doing pivot tables for [DATE-21].
Agent: Then you can also, if you consider if you want to do this, broader, really social and governance, API management and tracking.
Agent: So things like we have our [ORG-9] dashboard and you can attract demographic information and layer that in if you want to. So that's [DATE-13] and some of the benefits of that growth bundle. I'll stop here.
Agent: Am I at least, You know, are some of the darts hitting the middle of the target?
EndUser: I hope maybe not all of them, but I just like. Like I'm glad we're not.
EndUser: I hear because I was like, we have a BI tool and I don't know about the integrations, but obviously if I can get this stuff into we use DOMO, like if I can get potential integrations and tech stack.
Agent: Any kind of
EndUser: Compliments that's always a big Cell point and then also I should probably mention that I got hit with like a corrective action any eco baddest too.
Agent: For one of our customers
EndUser: So I Okay, I'm just firing on all cylinders with these clients. We have right now.
EndUser: So the reporting to me can help me bring up the average, if you will, specifically, especially given that eco-vattice is going to change the rating, change the curve for us [DATE-6].
EndUser: We aren't going to be graded the same regardless, even if we do everything the same, we're going to be not given the higher rating
Agent: Or the whatever, how your metal, Yeah. Sure, honey. So [PERSON-1] and his team can help raise your scores, both with [GPE-3] and also [PRODUCT-3]. They can be like a trusted advisor around that at some level of advisory services.
Agent: You brought up [PRODUCT-3]. I think I said this before, but we do have a pre-built integration that's free.
Agent: Obviously, you have to have your subscription with [PRODUCT-3], but it is a free connector in our app store ready to go for [PRODUCT-4] to [PRODUCT-3]. So we do have that.
Agent: And then as we think about integrations, you put it in the brought that up You have a lot of different ways to extend the NetzERO [PERSON-10] d platform because it's built on top of the core [ORG-10] e platform .
Agent: So whether it's the open API, as you know, [ORG-2] has a very robust and easy to integrate with API or [PRODUCT-5] or other middleware, you can bring in your spend data from your ERP system and integrate with that or business travel systems or we have some pre-built connectors like you kavana.
Agent: So anyway, I'll stop there if you have any questions around the integrations. We can also talk a little bit about data collection that's on the slide.
EndUser: Is it fair to say that [PERSON-1] and Green Impact can bring to the table something that are, so if not zero cloud is a decarbonization sort of platform, if you will, can Green Impact bring more of an end to end?
EndUser: Program management, like ESG program management feel, or does Net Zero Cloud actually do that?
EndUser: I'm just not understanding. Yeah, there definitely is program management with inside of [LOC-1].
EndUser: That's really kind of the idea that they have for decarbonization, right?
EndUser: Once you have your underlying inventory all there, you can start to look at what projects you might want to implement to actually do the decarbonization. And then you can kind of stack those on top of each other.
EndUser: To see what the ultimate end results will be. And you can do a lot of that data modeling in the tool that allows you to kind of see those sorts of things.
EndUser: I won't go as far to say that we're, you know, an ESG decarbonization firm, right?
EndUser: But we understand the technology and how to make your team get the best use out of the technology.
EndUser: Okay, but for like, if you're looking at the ESG, you're looking for the social governance like where does that fall, right?
Agent: And the governance, bits of it,
EndUser: Environmental, we're over here with [PERSON-9] and then there's the company. My company itself doesn't have a program, like an end to feel good about contributing end.
Agent: We want to make everybody to better environmental everything, you name it. So I'm trying to solve for that problem too. OK, so here's you to read this.
EndUser: A list and I don't expect
Agent: And it's, you know, but this, these are all the different KPIs that are already in the data mode.
EndUser: So you have environmental
Agent: On the left, social, and then governance.
Agent: And you can also add, if you really need certain custom categories or other capabilities, you can you know, this is the underlying data model, right?
EndUser: Add them. But,
Agent: And then you can surface that up depending upon which ones you want to track. Demographic information is pretty common. And then again, I'm doing wizard behind the curtain here. We do have a pre-built.
Agent: [PERSON-13] dashboard that can show that demographic information and you can pull this information. I don't know. I think we talked about this.
Agent: Do you have [DATE-19] because it can integrate with Workday where you can just download a CSV for us.
EndUser: And have that data be anonymized?
EndUser: No, no Workday
Agent: There are competitors. Oh, to cut it.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So, I'm going to cut it. I'm going actually, this is my world.
Agent: This is
Agent: My entire career at [ORG-2] has been spent on the impact management side of things. And I think you were basically asking about like an end to end impact management program for your organization.
Agent: Now we're talking about the technology here, right?
Agent: We've got the tools to track the outcomes. We've got an actual programs and initiatives feature that you would use to sort of track the performance of the initiatives you have around things like, you know.
Agent: Changing things under [ORG-9], improving your metrics under [ORG-9], or taking a look into your value chain and improving your metrics up and down your value chain. So we've got tools to help you manage all of that.
Agent: But I think also what we bring to the table is many, many years of experience as an organization in doing exactly those things. And we have a lot of depth in things like volunteer management with the [ORG-2] platform.
Agent: Grants management with the [ORG-2] platform, whether that's literally, you know, we actually have a [ORG-9] module.
Agent: If that's something where you need to, you know, launch that, you've got like an employee matching program and you want to be tracking those funds and seeing what's the impact of those funds, we actually have components that can do that.
Agent: Now, [PERSON-13] is more on the compliance and reporting end, as well as then the programs and outcomes kind of end of tracking all of that.
Agent: But the bigger picture is that the [ORG-2] platform, the [ORG-2] ecosystem and [ORG-2] itself are really kind of pioneers in that space from a technology perspective. So that's kind of my on what
EndUser: [MONEY-1] I thought was the larger question you might appreciate that. I appreciate that. I know that [ORG-2] has a [PRODUCT-6].
EndUser: It worked at a couple of different software companies and there's some [ORG-2], there's some interesting stuff that you would never to do.
Agent: Expect Salesforce
EndUser: That's right. That's
EndUser: I think. So the part that I would add onto that and [PERSON-14] showed kind of the objects and the data that are available.
EndUser: What we have done
EndUser: And have done quite a bit actually is helping our customers to start to gather a lot of that information and develop the process for gathering that data because that's really the first step in creating the policy or the process around what you want to do.
EndUser: You have to have an understanding of where you're getting all of that data and where you're starting from as a starting point.
EndUser: We're just not going to actually help you write the policy around we're going to do this or that. That's kind of where we would stop. Got it. No, fair
Agent: [PERSON-13]. I appreciate the boundaries. So. Okay. Great. Well, in terms of different capabilities that we were talking about, let me show you where you might start here.
Agent: So consider this like, year one or year one and a half, you start with your data coming in, the data gets organized, you know, and basically it's formatted correctly to these categories.
Agent: Then the calculations are done in the platform. All these emission factors are preloaded in the platform, or you can add your own custom emission factors. It's really a flexible platform and easy to do. Then the calculations are done.
Agent: And then once you upgrade to growth, you'll have that reporting and compliance hub, but you don't upgrade to growth. You have the auditing dashboard and the data gap filling capabilities and ways to really manage that data better.
Agent: And you can always, for [DATE-19], export a CSV and green impact can help you for the [GPE-3] reporting and things like that just for [DATE-19].
Agent: But the data will live in [DATE-23] so that in [DATE-4] and beyond that [GPE-3] reporting is really super automated.
Agent: So that's... kind of a high level of a lot of the capabilitie s that live under the hood . And I know that's a lot to process.
Agent: In terms of the compliance and reporting hub, I talked about that a little bit, but I just want to dive into it in a little more detail. So. We have this disclosure compliance reporting hub.
Agent: This is in the growth bundle that you would upgrade to. And like I said, it allows you to report at scale.
Agent: So it has these pre-built templates, the middle logos you see here for [GPE-3] and [LOC-2] and other voluntary reporting frameworks.
Agent: And you can tag questions, you can tag answers, qualitative and quantitative data, and They will show up in these templates.
Agent: And what we're going to do also is, as part of our product roadmap, is we built out a template for [LOC-2] once they came out with their guidance in [DATE-17].
Agent: And then we were off to the races with product and we built the template. We do the same thing for [GPE-4] once they announced in [DATE-19], like I said.
Agent: But then again, if you want to create your own custom reports for your [DATE-19] report, You collect the data in here and then you send it off to your graphic designers.
Agent: There's the ability to do that or key customer reports. I know you've mentioned a couple of key customers. You create your template for them, the data is put in there, and then
EndUser: [DATE-17] you can just update that template and be able to submit that PDF to your key customer. Yeah, we're actually even seeing a lot of suppliers demanding like data and formatted in a particular [PRODUCT-7].
EndUser: And we can certainly make sure
Agent: That net zero cloud would align that you can just easily export that data and then they to import it into their tool.
EndUser: Would be able
Agent: Should we dive into licensing and pricing?
Agent: Yeah, right. OK, so this is the growth package that sort of the whole [ORG-13] of all the capabilities for the most part.
Agent: The only thing that's optional is a supplier portal, but you're not really at that stage yet to want a separate portal to engage directly with suppliers yet.
Agent: So basically, the full set of capabilities is included the growth package, including that compliance reporting how I just showed you.
Agent: Think of this as something you might upgrade to [DATE-21] or in [DATE-21] But you really start with the starter package And this gives you that auditable process and syste m for managing your scope 2, and 3 data There's two categories of scope 3, business travel and freight you start out with You have the auditing capabilities the data gap filling capabilities, the workflows the CANBAN board to track your progres s those various different reporting .
Agent: Initiatives and datasets. You have a subset of dashboards and we'll show these to you. It basically is a really great foundational system to get started. It includes three users.
Agent: When you upgrade to growth, you get two more users for a total of five. In terms of pricing, this is the cut to the chase slide. You would start with the second line item.
Agent: At $[MONEY-2] a year at that run rate for the starter package. You could do that for [DATE-21]. And then you would upgrade, cost to upgrade, oops, sorry, is [MONEY-3] more.
Agent: You'd be at $[MONEY-4] per year for the growth bundle. That kind of includes pretty much everything. And then if you want to add additional users, it's a right around [MONEY-5] for additional user.
Agent: So I'll let you that sink in for a second. Sure. What, in terms of the starter package and
EndUser: Starting out, is that within the realm of the possible do you think?
EndUser: It's a really at the end of a calendar year, my friend.
Agent: Solid question
EndUser: Okay. I have no authority, but is like it's very
Agent: What I can say [ORG-13], right?
Agent: Okay. Yeah.
EndUser: Okay, good.
Agent: All right. So we're within the range of kind of what folks. Okay. All right. Good.
EndUser: So that was my sort of, you know, transparent presentation.
Agent: I how much I appreciate.
EndUser: Can't even tell you [ORG-4].
Agent: Yeah. So I'm going to hand things off to [PERSON-1] to ask a few questions and he can kind of talk through what his side of the equation might be. So [PERSON-1], do you want to kind of introduce
EndUser: Green impact a little bit more and then we'll I'll start. Make sense. Let me pull this up.
EndUser: Alright, everyone can see. The slide now. Yes, okay, perfect. So we didn't, you know, I introduced ourselves a little bit previously, but green impact is, you know, we have.
EndUser: We spun out of a larger consulting firm at [DATE-26], very much intentionally to focus on net zero cloud implementations.
EndUser: Since then, we've really gone through and done a handful of implementations and figured out the efficiencies of the Implementation and have worked to develop some IP that will really help us make the Implementation much more efficient.
EndUser: An example of that, and [PERSON-14] even mentioned it, right?
EndUser: So all of the assets that you have in the system, they all have emissions factors that get connected to them so that any time that you bring in energy use, it automatically gets the correct emissions.
EndUser: Factors signed to it . And so we've created some automations that automatically assign the correct emissions factors to the address based off of their location and just some more general things like that.
EndUser: But it just makes that, you know, it takes that one manual step of relating the asset to emissions factor out.
EndUser: And we've done a number of different things like that to really make sure that we can be efficient with the implementations. And at a very high level, I'll walk you through what the Implementation project process looks like.
EndUser: So, Typically, we're going to start with just figuring out exactly what the tool needs to do, making sure that we're aligned with your goals.
EndUser: We're going to create the users and enable some of the base features of Net Zero Cloud so that we can get you into them and start using it as a tool to be educating you as we're doing the implementation.
EndUser: Next, we'll really, like I said, start configuring some of the more intricate aspects of Net Zero Cloud, probably some of the object configurations, drop towns, going to turn on [ORG-14], and then really design the carbon footprint.
EndUser: What level do we want and what cadence do we want that at?
EndUser: Then we're going to really turn our attention to more of the data, right?
EndUser: Where are we going to be getting the data from?
EndUser: How can we engage those data owners?
EndUser: We also want to determine the process for acquiring that data in the future, not just the one time.
EndUser: That's really a bit of our focus is making sure that we can set up a process so that this is not just a one-time data gathering exercise, but we're really creating a process so that the data can give into the tool on an ongoing basis.
EndUser: Typically, we're going to review all of your data initially and make sure that we have everything that we need. And then we'll proceed with the historical data loads.
EndUser: I know [PERSON-14] mentioned that the data gap filler a couple of times. But after we get the historical data loaded, it's typically very common that you've missed a couple of bills.
EndUser: There's some bills that you weren't able to get a hold of. So we'll use the data gap filler to make sure that we have a complete inventory. and then really go through the QA process and loading the data.
EndUser: You know, including that, the tool is really like it's ready to go, right?
EndUser: So now we got to get your team trained. So we do a number of different trainings on the tool. Those can be more administrative trainings from the IT perspective.
EndUser: It can also be the end-by-step-by-step end-user training, making sure that you know all the ins and outs of the tool and the platform.
EndUser: The other type of training that we do regularly do is just for individuals that might be at a particular site or a particular facility and they're going to be just entering data into the tool in the future.
EndUser: It's a more streamlined, simplified training just to make sure that they understand how to get the correct data entered.
EndUser: I'm sorry, was there a question?
EndUser: Nope. Perfect. Green app impact has also designed some screen flows that just make that data entry process much more simplified.
EndUser: So rather than having to choose the correct scope three emission source or something along those lines, the user can click on the electricity symbol because that's what they want to enter.
EndUser: So you're just really trying to almost turbo-tax the user interface from the site user perspective.
EndUser: Is that like an overlay
EndUser: [PERSON-1] like how does that yeah?
EndUser: Yeah, that's exactly what it is. It really just fits into their all. They're all design using sales for screen flows.
EndUser: So they're, you know, designed to be built right into the into the product and rather than seeing like the normal detail screen with all of the fields on it.
EndUser: The user gets a, you know, a window that kind of almost like a wizardess tool that will step them through the process of what they need to enter. We would be glad to
EndUser: Show you that, you know, at [DATE-26], if necessary. For this whole end to end, like how much do I need myself.
EndUser: Salesforce admin .
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, it doesn't actually need to be all that much, right?
EndUser: So, you know, it really, it almost depends on your team and your policy, right?
EndUser: It's quite common for us to, because this is a new tool, and it's not like we're making modifications to your underlying sales cloud, oftentimes we can load and deploy directly in production.
EndUser: Other organizations, they require their IT team to be the ones touching anything that's in production. So it can be very, very little, or it can be a little bit more depending on kind of what your policies are.
EndUser: Got it. OK. Okay, and [PERSON-7] is here. Great.
Agent: Hi, team.
Speaker 6: How are you doing?
Speaker 6: Good. Good. I definitely came in the middle
EndUser: Of the presentation. Sorry about that, [PERSON-1]. Yeah, no worries. So I'll just finish up the last column there. I think we could probably pass it back to [PERSON-14] and [PERSON-3] for the actual demo.
EndUser: But then obviously, once we get the tool implemented, as [PERSON-14] said, maybe this is in a phase two, but we're starting to walk you through the [ORG-8] commitments, the program management piece.
EndUser: Obviously, the disclosures and making them as automated as possible. We also think there's, you know, some organizational benchmarking and things like that are possible to just get a better sense of where you're at.
EndUser: So, you know, certainly that is our kind of purview on the Implementation process.
EndUser: Any questions or anything I can answer for you?
EndUser: I feel like I interrupted you with my questions specifically. So thanks for your patience on that.
EndUser: I think it's really cool that you decided purposefully to take it to the next level and focus directly with not zero cloud, like it just means a lot. Yeah, it really does.
EndUser: I have a gentleman on my staff that, as we were kind of going through the transition process, this is back in [DATE-38] when it was Sustainability Cloud, not that Zero Cloud, but he just has a very big passion for sustainability.
EndUser: So he brought this to me and I was like, wow, this is an amazing idea. It's something that I could really get on board. And really having that mission driven
Agent: Purpose behind the organization has been huge for us.
Agent: Well, thanks, [PERSON-7]. I think we'll do some really world's fastest introductions just so you know who we are. And then I'd love to hear from you what you're most interested in us covering.
Agent: If you have any questions or objectives or things that you think we should think about. But I'm [PERSON-14]. I'm an Enterprise Account Executive Burnett Zero Cloud.
Agent: I have a background in [ORG-13], but also I've been in the world of [LOC-3] and SaaS and all that. So kind of have background in two worlds. [PERSON-3], do you want to
Agent: Briefly introduce yourself?
Agent: And then [PERSON-1], I guess you get another chance also. Sure, [PERSON-13], delightful to meet you. My name's [PERSON-2]. I'm based here in [GPE-1]. I've been with [ORG-2] for going on [DATE-1].
Agent: And in that time, this is my third cloud. The prior clouds were nonprofit cloud and education cloud. So I definitely have the interesting perspective on the [ORG-2] platform and how its technologies can be applied to use
EndUser: Cases that people don't tend to think of when they think about [ORG-2] and [PRODUCT-6].
EndUser: And then, Hi, [PERSON-7], I think you got some of some of my green impact introduction. But my name is [PERSON-4]. I'm the CEO of [ORG-13].
EndUser: We are a [ORG-2] partner that specifically focuses on net zero cloud implementations.
Speaker 6: Okay.
EndUser: Go for
Speaker 6: [PERSON-7]. You're doing your intro. Oh gosh. Okay. So [PERSON-13], I'm [PERSON-21]. And I'm a program manager here, a degree what I'm most interested in is how we make [ORG-1]'s life easier.
EndUser: [PERSON-7], [PERSON-13].
Speaker 6: She is always looking that I
Agent: Out for me. She thinks
EndUser: Maybe take on a little too much on occasion.
Speaker 6: So maybe kind of sort of, and we really do have a small team here.
Speaker 6: There's only a handful of folks that are even, you know, know that we're pursuing this, we must pursue it, and it will impact a lot of our team because it will make our sales cycle stronger to have this in our back pocket.
Speaker 6: But people don't realize that they need it. So we hope to be able to deliver something to them and make their day delightful because of it.
EndUser: We're doing all basically and we just need people to understand that we've done all the legwork We're being thorough.
Speaker 6: The legwork
Speaker 6: And that So
EndUser: Yeah, that's why we're at it now for sure Yeah, that's great.
Agent: So kitty, I'm gonna just review kind of like the why are we here or answer the so what question about why [WORK_OF_ART-1] cloud and how it might help [ORG-1].
Agent: So we kind of broke it down into [DATE-37] too but let's just talk [DATE-8] is that this would give [ORG-1] a true system to manage this data because with the new [GPE-4] regulations and as you know the [ORG-13] is finally going to make up its mind and come out with new regulations and you've got these other voluntary but very important reporting frameworks and you've customers asking for close.
Agent: Clean, accurate reports This really gives [ORG-1] a foundational syste m to begin to wrap her arms around thi s and be able to kind of scale her efforts over time It gives you, it's built to be auditable So there's an auditing dashboard all kinds of auditing capabilities other ways like data gap filling and other s to make sure that the calculation s and the data quality is at a high level And then also [ORG-2] and I'm gonna cover this, a new topic .
Agent: [ORG-2] provides guidance, Green Impact provides guidance. It's just kind of a layer of trusted advisors sort of hand-holding throughout the reporting cycles that [ORG-1] will go through.
Agent: Then you also have this single source of truth, this data management for future reporting. So you have a foundation to work off of. Then this little bit of, going behind the curtain here again.
Agent: I'm going to just share with you the layers of support. We talked a bit about the software licenses, but what gets lost in a shuffle is the human being inside of all this.
Agent: So I just wanted to cover off on this very briefly, just so also [ORG-1]'s aware, including your license subscription. Well, really four layers of support in addition to, we'll talk about green impact again.
Agent: First off, you get access to our sustainability team, which has 64 plus people. So down the line, let's say [ORG-1]'s really interested in scope three and supply chain emissions.
Agent: We can connect her with various experts that we have on our supply chain and how they've developed various best for practices, whether it's legal clauses or how you directly engage with suppliers in the most effective ways.
Agent: We can connect her with those subjects. subject matter experts on our side .
Agent: The second area is we also have the sustainability practice focused for that's focused on our [ORG-21] or cloud customers where they get more high level strategic guidance.
Agent: This might be around how [GPE-4] might affect your reporting and data collection approaches and what you should be thinking about. Or we've had recent workshops around [PRODUCT-8] and how AI layers in and how you can leverage that.
Agent: We also have sort of more standard tech support. And then we also have customer success support that's focused only on [ORG-13]. So you get those layers of additional support that [ORG-2] provides as part of the license.
Agent: And then... On the fee-based side is, as [PERSON-1] went through, you get the Implementation support with layers of training woven into that, plus some hand-holding.
Agent: After the platform goes live, [PERSON-1]'s team provides you with additional guidance around if you need to configure something, or design a report, or things like that. Their team can provide that kind of hand-holding after you go live.
Agent: And then there's also the layer of advisory services that [PERSON-1]'s team can provide, but they also have a partnership as [ORG-2] does with [ORG-19]. So Green Impact can partner with [ORG-19], the nation's probably best known and largest.
Agent: Environmental Consulting Firm has a very deep and wide bench of consultants, so Green Impact can also work with them and bring an additional guidance.
Agent: So there's a lot of layers of help that [ORG-1] can tap into in addition to just this software mostly talk about.
Speaker 6: License that we
Agent: Any questions around this?
Agent: No, come on here. Okay. So I'm going to stop sharing. So [PERSON-3].
Agent: If you can kind of think year one in terms of just [ORG-1]'s exposure to the platform, maybe show some of the dashboards she would have access to, just kind of an
Agent: Introduction to Net Zero Cloud, that would be really helpful. Thank you. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, first of all, This is [ORG-2]. The user interface is very similar across all of our different clouds.
Agent: And we can, in some scenarios, I have a single login that gives me access to multiple [ORG-2] clouds.
Agent: And if I go up to my app selector up here, I would be able to navigate over to those other clouds, but that's all just background.
Agent: So using the [ORG-2] permissions that allow me to access NHTC or Cloud, here I am. And everything that I see on the screen.
Agent: We've set up to make this as easy to use and to put the right information in the right people's hands at the right time . So the dashboards that I'm displaying right now, I set those up myself.
Agent: I chose which dashboards to display there. I'm not a programmer. I'm not even much of a developer.
Agent: So I using our very easy to use tools spent [TIME-2] setting up the tabs across the top to, you know, for essentially customizing the story that we're telling.
Agent: Over on the right, I've got things like my tasks. I've got a CSV template. I've got items to approve. Basically, elements of the [ORG-2] platform, features of the [ORG-2] platform, that we're leveraging to operationalize sustainability across our organization.
Agent: So we're leveraging workflows and tasks to set up these reminders and notifications and alerts around various things that are going to keep us on task and on schedule throughout [DATE-38]. So things like, you know.
Agent: Are we ready for scope three and our procurement summary is obviously that's down the road a little piece our fleet vehicle invoices for q Our an alert that we're seeing some energy that was entered that's outside of rang e And we're going to need to investigate that and that's going to be automatically assigned to a person to [ORG-1] or hopefully to a tea m To investigate what's going on or you know, do we need to take action ?
Agent: That's down the road again. Chaius level dashboard that we see right in the middle, my climate action dashboard, a summary of all of my activity across my organization, breaking down, breaking out automatically, breaking out scope appropriately.
Agent: Even breaking down location-based versus market-based emissions under Scope 2. These dashboards are all very interactive. We've got a number of filters across the top.
Agent: So I can drill down by, if you're a larger organization, I might be drilling down by business unit, business region, individual assets, or categories of assets. All those filters can be customized.
Agent: We do provide this set straight out of the box to make it easier to use from [DATE-35]. I can navigate and really investigate my own.
Agent: My data directly from this dashboard So if I click into any section of the dashboard it's going to update other section s to reflect the data that I essentially just filtered on and then I reset it back by clicking there I've got a lot of great informatio n at my fingertips of breaking down my emission s by asset or by source, by asset category or location And really, over time, giving me a heat ma p of the main sources of emissions across my organization And ideally, ultimately the opportunities for us to find emissions reductio ns across the organizatio n. And as you can see, I can review a [ORG-19] t. I can see the breakdown of my consumpti on of renewable energy grilling a little bit [PERSON-19] So that's our kind of highest level or executive leve l, or we call that, I like to call that the C-suite vie w. This is much more of an operational view of the dat a, righ t?
Agent: The energy intensity variants across my different locatio ns filtered by [PERSON-19]: So I'm gonna be able to do an [GPE-5] compariso n. I don't wanna compare a data [PERSON-23] to an office, but I do want to see who are my top performing offices and my bottom perform ing offices.
Agent: Maybe I need to know why or maybe I already know why and I just want to see t hat the projects that I'm launching are moving us towards our goal in improving performance acr
EndUser: Oss all of [PERSON-17].
Agent: Going pretty fast and I'll just kind of bring it back to you and ask for questions.
EndUser: You're like speed reading, you're great.
EndUser: So we talk a lot about offices, right?
EndUser: And locales and locations.
EndUser: But how does, how do you reflect like a largely remote work?
EndUser: Like we have offices that we works or there's sort of leases that have energy built in. And then we have hundreds of people that are,
Agent: Hang it out, do in their own thing, create in their own impact, you know. Right.
Agent: So obviously, there's, there are kind of two things, right?
Agent: So, offices, well, Under the [ORG-23] protocol, there's a whole decision matrix around where does your responsibility for the emissions lie?
Agent: And a least facility that you have complete operational completely different from a [ORG-17] space.
EndUser: Control over is
Agent: Now, the great thing is we have a feature that we call, I'm on the wrong tab, I think over here, for an individual location.
EndUser: So I'm on the record
Agent: In this case, it's our headquarters.
Agent: So this very large lease facility And we may have had to make some decision s about how are we allocating scope, right Again, do we have full operational partial operational control Do we have zero operational control Is gonna determine that So we have this feature that's called scope allocation And essentially location by location we determine what is the right scope allocatio on that ownership or control And then we agree .
EndUser: Is a
EndUser: Control Do we have
Agent: N based associate that and time setup thing basically during your Implementation working You'd help they'd help you navigate that decision process Set up the scope allocations and then basically as a
EndUser: That's a that's a one
EndUser: Batch upload all of your offices with the allocations set up already Does and when and when we were saying offices were also like a we work in [GPE-6], right is like a scope my home office here,
Agent: To, but like what, right?
Agent: So I did, I did a stop. Yeah, I stopped.
EndUser: It's confusing.
Agent: The next piece that you mentioned is homework.
Agent: And we know that is [PERCENT-1] scope three, right?
Agent: You're not paying anybody's electricity bills for them. So there's really no question I'll say honestly, that is an emerging picture for everybody.
EndUser: About that.
Agent: We at [ORG-2] are developing a model that's very similar to our employee commute model.
EndUser: In fact, we're sending out
Agent: A single survey. It is our employee commute and homework survey. So that's how we're tackling it. With just a series of questions about how often are you in the office versus not, what kind of equipment
EndUser: Do you have at home and then we're creating a formula that's going to do that on the back end for us.
EndUser: So the governing bodies, like generally speaking, the governing bodies that say what [ORG-23] is, right?
EndUser: And then it's [ORG-8] is validating that like, how, if it's an evolving picture for everybody, like how patient, how patient are
Agent: The people that you report to because it is sort of like, it's a bit nebulous. It's not the only category that's a bit nebulous either.
Agent: So the whole, I mean, this is really, scope one and two are really straightforward, right?
Agent: I mean, I kind of feel like we've had that nailed down for [DATE-45], but scope three is this big fuzzy thing that honestly keeps expanding. The standards are evolving.
Agent: And typical approach is, you make a good faith effort using validated, reliable sources for any assumption.
EndUser: The sort of
Agent: That you're making and you provide that sort of digital paper trail to the sourc e of your assumptions .
EndUser: That leads back And that's adequate [DATE-3]. That may change, but that's adequate for [DATE-3].
EndUser: I feel like I asked this question too, which is like, it just indicates how much angst I should have, right?
EndUser: Like your
EndUser: Answer
Speaker 6: Either calms So like,
Agent: Me down or amps me up.
Agent: What is that?
Agent: The pieces is materiality, right?
Agent: Now, we actually have a materiality assessment module. So if you haven't yet done one, you can do that leveraging our solution. Basically, you define
Agent: Your stakeholders associate stakeholders. Let me pull one up real quick. So this is based on the actual [ORG-19], [ORG-19], double materiality assessment. So we pre-seed it with the actual materiality topic questions that they ask you to use.
Agent: And then you associate individual stakeholders with the questions.
Agent: And those stakeholders essentially are going to review and respond to the questionnaire and give you their input on what's relevant to your organization and what and through that we then calculate and I'd love to pull it up but unfortunately it's not set up in my demo or just yet.
Agent: So we basically have a visualization of that of the output of that that's going to tell you visually.
Agent: Here's what's highest priority for your organization, as well as highest risk I think that's to me they're kind of the same thing if it's material to you it represents a risk as well, getting to your point.
Agent: How much angst should you have about it?
Agent: And, you know is work from home, highly material to your organization has a high impact to your organization?
Agent: Well then your angst level should be a little bit higher about how accurate
EndUser: There's an expectation that you
Agent: Need to be an d how firmly you have to have it dialed So, let me create I love I love it.
Agent: In. Got it.
EndUser: Okay. an angst dashboard.
Speaker 6: It.
Agent: An angst.
Speaker 6: I think I have someone internally
Agent: That. Or quadrant.
EndUser: Or
Agent: Quadrant angst. By the way, [PERSON-3], maybe because time's a little limit. [PERSON-19] is correct me is a priority.
EndUser: Unless you don't think this would be interesting because that is kind of a nice functionality.
Agent: Maybe the auditing dashboard
EndUser: For me to tweak the screen like I'm seeing the characters look like. Sanskrit right now like I can't hear if I can do for my en d I know you're in a demo environment,
Agent: It's you or if there's anything so I'm no t Okay, so I'm just blind. You could have just said that [PERSON-3] like no it's pretty cool and it's the difference
EndUser: In resolution.
EndUser: Yeah resolution Sorry about that.
EndUser: Screen is getting scrunched down.
Agent: There we go.
EndUser: That's getting older. Yeah.
EndUser: But that blue font read it and read as well so don't feel that.
EndUser: Is a little bit tough for me to no it's okay.
EndUser: Yeah,
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, that is what that is actually so yeah.
EndUser: The one thing that I wanted to know before you jump into this, [PERSON-3], is so Green Impact does have kind of the survey that [PERSON-3] was describing that they're using internally.
EndUser: Green Impact does have that built as an app that we call hybrid work wizard and it does do exactly that.
EndUser: So, it calculates scope three, category then we also get their work from home emissions calculated at the same time.
EndUser: Seven employee commute, but
EndUser: So we do have a solution that like completely nails that.
EndUser: Yeah, I think that's largely so, if you're looking historically, and those of you that have been doing this for a long time, that's great and I have it, but I think that's what everybody's leaned into, generally speaking in the industry, which is, hey, we're environmentally friendly, everybody works at home, we don't have all these offices, we aren't using all this energy, and it's like surprise, that's what matters.
Agent: We worked out that it's something like [PERCENT-2] reduction, it's not huge, Yeah, we work No, work from home.
EndUser: It is lower, but it's not huge.
EndUser: Or is that what you said?
EndUser: Oh, work from the office. Yeah. So we will list themselves [PERCENT-3] renewable energy. And like, I don't even know what to do with that piece of information right there.
EndUser: I think the problem is that a lot of organizations, they still have the office and then people
Agent: Are working from home. So now it's just
Agent: A move. Yeah. And you turn I mean, not anymore.
EndUser: The air condition on at home, right?
EndUser: On a hot day.
Agent: I
EndUser: Don't. No, not now, but you know, but no, I mean, like, I think about that stuff now, right, because If you're going to do the survey that you're talking about, those are going to be the type of questions.
EndUser: And we will have people here who ultimately want to make an impact, which is what we want to drive with a whole programmatic approach.
EndUser: So the more that I can get the people here at a granular level to fill out the survey and to feel like they have a stake in it and somebody up-skill themselves and a couple of things to do better, then you've got a program or you've got the groundswell [WORK_OF_ART-2] it.
Agent: For a program.
Agent: And that's what I want.
EndUser: Hey, We've got about [ORG-1].
Agent: [TIME-3]. Yeah. Unless we go into a little bit of overtime. But I don't know if [PERSON-3], are you available for a tiny bit of
Agent: Overtime?
Agent: Or
EndUser: [PERSON-1], or I can remember him. Well, I think we, yeah, my overtime is a little limited. But if we can get into this dash that, or this audit, I'll ask you that we could.
EndUser: And then I need to know if [PERSON-1] has
Agent: Cost too, right?
Agent: [PERSON-1]?
EndUser: Oh, right. Yeah.
EndUser: I probably I want to
EndUser: Have a couple questions before get to cost. But I can tell you, I get to tell you at a very high level, like my costs will probably be very similar to what the licensing look like.
EndUser: Sales force
EndUser: That's general. That we can be
EndUser: In if we're looking at a starter implementation. Okay, dope. We can, we can leave that there. And you can ask me all the questions you want to get to a better place. So yeah, let's check this out.
Agent: So this is a way of setting up [PERSON-13] to really facilitate your audit process. It could be an internal audit, could be an external audit.
Agent: We do provide an auditor persona in our sort of permissioning side of things, which is essentially a read-only user profile.
Agent: An auditor coming to this screen is able to launch in, run through a flow that's going to essentially look for any records that have been flagged as requiring review or other for a variety of different reasons.
Agent: It's going to share with you what those audit flags are. And then go ahead and confirm that this is the output of that. We're aware of these are the ones that are flagged.
Agent: That's the steps that I'm going through. It's got a layout of the steps that I need to take.
Agent: And then ultimately from a data analysis perspective, looking at the same information we've been looking at, but through the lens of our carbon dashboard, which is going to point at in a fairly granular way, where are our emissions coming from at the database record level, right?
Agent: So out of our scope three, more than 10,000 of our records are specifically purchase goods and services.
Agent: We can also see visually, that's also contribute to the Moonneganropy HIT the lion's share of those emissions in our scope three area.
Agent: Now, if I want to go further in, where am I on this, and take action against this?
Agent: There we go, the audit review. So those same records that we were seeing in a moment ago that are flagged. Well, this is where I can go through. Look for an individual record.
Agent: And if necessary, take action directly from here. This is after all a [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: So, if you're looking at th e taking action, meaning I can open a task, I can log a call against it, I can even create a new record directly for me.
Agent: So some of the audit capabilities, this is more of the auditor's user experience. On the product side, the product was built with audit capabilities in mind from the ground up. So record locking capabilities, field change history, by default.
Agent: A number of other features that really give it a very robust audit ready capability.
Agent: Yeah, you'll always know who did what when and there's an audit history trail. So.
EndUser: So it's going
Agent: To be pointing back at me.
Speaker 6: Like, auditing. Well,
EndUser: Hopefully
EndUser: Not.
EndUser: No, I'll need it because I'll be like, where did I go wrong?
EndUser: Yeah, that's what the so.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Agent: Very good. Yeah, in terms of. year one stuff. We mentioned a few things on that list.
Agent: What would you say?
Agent: I mean, in terms of like we had the, oh, [ORG-17], can you, do you have that one ready to go?
Agent: Do you have that module?
EndUser: And I guess while [PERSON-3] pulls that up, I did have a couple of questions about the [ORG-17] that you were trying or about to Yeah, do you have do you have admissions data done for scope one
EndUser: To submit submit for the.
EndUser: And two already or you just have raw. I don't want any admissions data for scope always have nothing.
EndUser: One. We So
EndUser: It's just you two. It was our buildings and it's me on this excavation hunt, our lease stuff, which is always historically had energy included. Like we've never seen a bill to this point. And I'm scraping data for [DATE-45].
EndUser: That's what I'm scraping data for. And then we'll have to do [PERCENT-4] reduction, apparently. I'm glad [PERSON-3]'s nodding.
Speaker 6: That means I'm understanding the whole thing.
EndUser: Yeah, so that is where I am at right now and the sooner I can get this rolling because as you [PERSON-19] w the criteria for [ORG-21] and we will be out of that ability and I don't even reall y hear something.
EndUser: Is changing
EndUser: I don't know that I really even understand the whole grandfathering process.
EndUser: Lik e are they going to kick us out then [DATE-34] because we no longer meet the criteria or do yo u get grandfathered in ?
EndUser: I don't know the answer to that either.
EndUser: No, right?
EndUser: I don't either. You guys validate my confusion. So I very much appreciate this time that we're spending, even if we're kind of running with scissors while so fast.
Agent: We're
Agent: Doing it. All changing Nobody We have people that
EndUser: Can keep it all straight. is their full-time job. We really do. I know it's not my full time job. That's what [PERSON-7]'s talking about when she's like this isn't her full time job. This is a that I do.
Agent: A thing
EndUser: But not
EndUser: At all like yeah it's crazy. So whatever questions we have [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Yeah, so I mean, just generally, I know some of this has been captured again, but you know, so how many how many we works are we talking about here?
EndUser: Like, give me some order of magnitude. In [DATE-45], it's not that many. It's probably [GPE-7]. We didn't have [GPE-8] until [DATE-34]. So [GPE-7], [GPE-9], [GPE-10]. [GPE-9]. [GPE-13], [GPE-13]. I think that's what I think I'm thinking.
EndUser: I think that's it. So it's something like. Yeah, five or six. Yeah. But the one that trips me up because for the states, it's the stuff.
EndUser: I can get at everything through the [ORG-21] That's not safe.
EndUser: Yeah, which locations were those again?
EndUser: Let me just put them down. That's just [GPE-7]. [GPE-8] will be [DATE-6]. I will have two different spaces. They were switching leases, I believe,
EndUser: For a bigger space in [GPE-8]. And I don't really even understand what energy costs, what kind of a <inaudible> grid they have there. Like, I don't know.
EndUser: Yeah, I think the [GPE-8] one was a bit more concerning to me. I know good emissions factors for [GPE-7].
EndUser: We've gotten
EndUser: So that one doesn't really I think we could certainly Yeah.
EndUser: Concern me all that much. help you. out there . We're not talking about like a fleet of vehicles or anything like that. You're not doing anything weird, like creating energy or anything like that.
EndUser: No, and our data centers would be three. We're just sort of like really focusing in on these lease environments.
EndUser: And as you know, with an [ORG-21], you're immediately setting goals, which means you got to turn over money, which means they audit you immediately.
EndUser: So we could get feedback and then we would know if we were sort of missing a thing or not.
EndUser: What's the date when you need to finalize the [ORG-8]?
EndUser: Well, technically, I believe the new 1.
EndUser: Regulations are [DATE-19]
EndUser: So, if that's what you're. Yeah, I mean, I guess I feel better. Yeah. What I was, I'm trying to figure out a way that, you know,
EndUser: We can ultimately help you kind of, you need to submit admissions data, right?
EndUser: With that, do you have, do you have that data like?
EndUser: Figuring. I'm scraping for two locations because I can't get this work footage on it right now. That's the problem is I don't have the square footage and so doing those estimations. Be eat. Yeah, you need square footage. Right.
EndUser: That's the like the literally the only to your guys's point, like it's a paper trail. And if I can't demonstrate why I came X.
EndUser: Up with number That's where I'm going to get in trouble. So it makes sense. Yeah. So I'm just I'm asking questions on a couple of fronts. A for the implementation.
EndUser: Then B if there's a short term like answer to helping you get the [ORG-8] submitted correctly. I think until I get those data points, I won't even know how to engage a green impact to do.
EndUser: You do what I mean?
EndUser: Like it's me, it's on us now to sort And so I have someone internally who's looking for this stuff, but obviously.
EndUser: Of get what I need.
EndUser: Ok.
EndUser: I can keep you in the loop on that part of it.
EndUser: As far as my other questions for the implementation, it would probably be like I said more along the lines of the IT side of things, right?
EndUser: Is it going to be us deploying directly in the production, or is that something that we need to be
EndUser: Working with your IT team to do?
EndUser: But you haven't said anything that you know, it was our admin. And he didn't come [DATE-3]. But if I were to have to read [PERSON-6]'s mind based on another project that I did with him, I would basically say
EndUser: He probably wouldn't have a problem deploying into production. Okay, I mean, we can certainly again, that's going to be the most efficient way to do it.
EndUser: So we can certainly make that assumption in our proposal and if we need to,
EndUser: You know, go back to the, you know, go back to the other way, then we can certainly, we can certainly do that. Yeah, he
EndUser: Really hates. tinkering in [GPE-14] too long. That makes sense to us. Again, it just creates another step in the process. And because new functionality that you're not
EndUser: This is brand
Agent: Using [DATE-3], the risk of something going wrong is very minimal because it's not there, right?
Agent: There's nothing. So you're at a very low risk. Yeah, [ORG-1], just made it super clear.
EndUser: Full transparency
EndUser: It's lower costs less time if Green Impact can get access to a production environment. Clear. OK.
EndUser: I think that's most of what I have for you [DATE-3]. I know we're [TIME-4] over and I don't want to hold anymore.
EndUser: I think that gives me what I need to come up with a proposal for you though. No, I appreciate you being patient enough to drag that out of me. If I've been it's after [TIME-5].
EndUser: So thank around with us
Agent: You for sticking as we kind of
Agent: Go through this entire process.
Agent: What am I looking at here, [PERSON-3]?
Agent: Oh, [ORG-17].
Agent: What?
EndUser: Sorry,
Agent: I just kind of left it on screen. This is the record where we create your [ORG-17] commitment, which is essentially just a sort of a tracking location.
Agent: But behind it, we actually build out the targets that go into it, which I'm not showing here, some of the wrong one. But we build out the targets underneath that.
Agent: There's a visualization of the path to emissions reduction that you just mentioned. Like if you're on your [PERCENT-4], we visualize what that looks like. And then that target that you've established actually rolls up and becomes.
Agent: Part of the visualizations. So if I pivot all the way back to the original climate action dashboard . Give it a moment to render because I'm on a slow network here.
Agent: Go to my carbon emissions forecast And that yellow my Science Based Targets screen.
EndUser: Line right there, that's Initiative commitment. OK. I mean, there it is. Yeah, exactly.
Agent: All right, well, what are our next steps here, [PERSON-14] and [PERSON-9]?
Agent: Well, I think you probably need just at least a proposal sent over to you, right?
Agent: And some slides so you can discuss this internally.
EndUser: [PERSON-1], Do we need to either via email or with a quick call with [ORG-1], just ask her a few more questions so you can dial in your side of the proposal?
Agent: No, I think I have what I need now. Again, I'll make the assumption around the, you know, directly in production and if we need to go back on that, we can.
Agent: But I'll, I think I have what I need at this point. Okay, so [ORG-1], we'll work on getting you a proposal.
Agent: And then do we need, would it be helpful?
Agent: So you're not sort of the middle person, explain everything, would it help to have a call with kind of the key budget approvers with you?
EndUser: Or what would be the best way to sort of facilitate understanding and in moving forward?
Speaker 6: Ideally if you're interested
EndUser: Yeah,
Speaker 6: Ideally if I'm interested in moving forward, [PERSON-6] is on the next call.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-7]?
Speaker 6: Thoughts on that?
EndUser: Yeah, I think that's,
Speaker 6: I think that makes sense from a systems perspective, [PERSON-6] would be the first in the way in it's going to be to make this work.
EndUser: On how easy, you know,
Speaker 6: We need [ORG-21]. Amber. As I do out
EndUser: Too far out. No, I don't think that's too far out at all, actually.
EndUser: I was going to say, I was going to say, I don't know if that's if [ORG-21]'s the I would say [ORG-21], probably, [PERSON-17] is going to take our recommendations.
Speaker 6: Better.
Speaker 6: And I'm going to raise my manager and so ultimately
EndUser: If I need support, like I can get [PERSON-17] in on the app. Okay. Yeah, then [ORG-21] makes sense. Okay, dope. All right, yeah, give us a little bit of time.
EndUser: We are coming end of [DATE-34] and I'm largely around through [DATE-41], but the company isn't a mad race because they technically shut down for that [DATE-45].
Agent: To the
EndUser: Everybody is not supposed to be here.
Agent: I'll be here though, doing things. So yeah, get all the things and before all the other people leave.
EndUser: So I'm just trying to
Agent: I'm kind of, what am I going to do?
Agent: So [PERSON-6] and the other folks that you mentioned would have basically have that meeting before the holidays or are we aiming for like [DATE-43], do you think?
EndUser: Um, it would, that's a really good question.
EndUser: I don't, I don't know if I want to go on an olim and say what it would end up being and then overcome I couldn't, you know, if I tell [PERSON-6] it's urgent, we can get him, we can get him within
Agent: It other people. Okay.
Agent: [DATE-53].
Speaker 6: Yes, he does. I mean, I know from a different project I'm working on with [PERSON-6], his first two weeks in [DATE-19], it would be so Those are good.
EndUser: Busy.
Speaker 6: Yeah, they're going to be done. Yeah, so I almost went preferred a grant. If we can grab time [DATE-51], that because I want to save his time in [DATE-19] for my other That has to go.
EndUser: Would be my preference
EndUser: Projects.
Speaker 6: That's just selfish. I know I'm totally selfish.
EndUser: Yes, I know. All right, awesome. No, next move is mine. Next move is mine. I do need maybe a little bit of documentation. Like a little tangibles would be great. But next move is mine. And I'll debrief [PERSON-6].
EndUser: And I'll probably end up doing it with [ORG-26] sync initially. And then we'll just
Agent: Go from there. OK. Yeah. And if you think [DATE-50] works, just float a few times to us. And I can coordinate with [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-9] and [PERSON-3]. And we can make
EndUser: It happen [DATE-50]. Yeah, for sure.
Agent: Let's just communicate through our [ORG-26] channel [ORG-1] in terms of availability and when you the folks.
EndUser: Meet with [PERSON-6] and Yeah, you know, So, awesome.
Agent: You know how it is to play with [PERSON-6].
EndUser: Okay, thanks, gentlemen. I appreciate it. Thank
Agent: You, [PERSON-7]. All right, everyone. Thank [DATE-48].
Agent: You so much. I appreciate Thank you all.
EndUser: It. Have
Agent: Take care.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They appreciated the transparency and detailed explanations provided by the seller and their team. The customer also expressed interest in moving forward with the deal, but wanted to discuss it internally first. They suggested including their budget approvers in a future call to facilitate understanding and moving forward. The seller agreed to send over a proposal and some slides for the customer to review. The customer also mentioned they would need to schedule a call with the key budget approvers and the seller's team. Overall, the customer seemed engaged and interested in the seller's product.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: It is unclear from the transcript if the right decision maker was on the call to move the deal forward. The customer, referred to as [PERSON-4], is the CEO of Green Impact, a Salesforce SI that focuses on net zero cloud implementations. However, it is mentioned that [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-7] would need to be involved in future discussions. The agreed-upon next steps include the seller preparing a proposal and slides for internal discussion at the customer's organization. The seller also suggested having a call with key budget approvers, including [PERSON-6], to facilitate understanding and moving forward. The proposed timeline for this call is before the holidays, but no specific date is set. The seller and customer agreed to communicate through their [ORG-26] channel for scheduling and availability.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The customer's top concerns about the seller's product were related to affordability and the urgency of their decarbonization plans. They explicitly asked about the fiscal feasibility of implementing the solution and mentioned that many companies are playing catch up in terms of reporting and decarbonization plans.

Additionally, the customer expressed interest in understanding the value of the platform, specifically in terms of streamlining the system, securing data collection, ensuring data quality, accurate calculations, and getting guidance from the seller's team. They also wanted to know about the potential benefits beyond the first year of implementation, such as reporting at scale, reusing information, AI layer for report population, and template format changes.

Lastly, the customer had questions about integrations with their existing tools and systems, such as their BI tool and PRODUCT-3. They also wanted to ensure that Green Impact could bring an end-to-end program management and ESG program management feel to the table, as they focus on net zero cloud implementations.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have done a better job introducing the company and its products, as the customer seemed unsure about the capabilities of the Net Zero Cloud platform and how it compares to Green Impact's services.

2. The sales rep could have provided more concrete examples of how the Net Zero Cloud platform can help the customer's organization, such as by reducing energy consumption, lowering costs, or improving sustainability reporting.

3. The sales rep could have addressed the customer's concerns about affordability more directly, by providing more detailed pricing information or discussing financing options.

4. The sales rep could have done a better job explaining the benefits of the Net Zero Cloud platform's integrations with other systems, such as Salesforce and DOMO, and how these integrations can help the customer's organization.

5. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep could have summarized the key value propositions of the Net Zero Cloud platform and how it can help the customer's organization, to ensure that the customer fully understands the benefits of the product.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""What would you really like? What's your top checklist for [DATE-3]'s conversation? Would you say so we make sure that we cover that?""
   The customer seemed more engaged as they started discussing their specific needs and requirements for the product.

2. ""Can I afford it?""
   The customer showed more engagement as they addressed their budget concerns and the financial feasibility of the deal.

3. ""Is it fair to say that [PERSON-1] and Green Impact can bring to the table something that are, so if not zero cloud is a decarbonization sort of platform, if you will, can Green Impact bring more of an end to end program management, like ESG program management feel, or does Net Zero Cloud actually do that?""
   The customer showed more engagement as they inquired about the additional services Green Impact could provide and how they complement the Net Zero Cloud platform.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are the questions they asked:

1. ""What would you really like? What's your top checklist for today's conversation? We'll make sure that we cover that.""
2. ""You brought up PRODUCT-3. I think I said this before, but we do have a pre-built integration that's free. Obviously, you have to have your subscription with PRODUCT-3, but it is a free connector in our app store ready to go for PRODUCT-4 to PRODUCT-3. So we do have that.""
3. ""And then as we think about integrations, you put it in the brought that up. You have a lot of different ways to extend the NetZERO platform because it's built on top of the core ORG-10 platform. So whether it's the open API, as you know, ORG-2 has a very robust and easy to integrate with API or PRODUCT-5 or other middleware, you can bring in your spend data from your ERP system and integrate with that or business travel systems or we have some pre-built connectors like you kavana.""
4. ""So, you know, it really, it almost depends on your team and your policy, right? It's quite common for us to, because this is a new tool, and it's not like we're making modifications to your underlying sales cloud, oftentimes we can load and deploy directly in production. Other organizations, they require their IT team to be the ones touching anything that's in production. So it can be very, very little, or it can be a little bit more depending on kind of what your policies are.""
5. ""So, typically, we're going to start with just figuring out exactly what the tool needs to do, making sure that we're aligned with your goals. We're going to create the users and enable some of the base features of Net Zero Cloud so that we can get you into them and start using it as a tool to be educating you as we're doing the implementation.""
6. ""Next, we'll really, like I said, start configuring some of the more intricate aspects of Net Zero Cloud, probably some of the object configurations, drop towns, going to turn on ORG-14, and then really design the carbon footprint. What level do we want and what cadence do we want that at?""
7. ""Then we're going to really turn our attention to more of the data, right? Where are we going to be getting the data from? How can we engage those data owners? We also want to determine the process for acquiring that data in the future, not just the one time.""
8. ""That's really a bit of our focus is making sure that we can set up a process so that this is not just a one-time data gathering exercise, but we're really creating a process so that the data can give into the tool on an ongoing basis.""
9. ""Typically, we're going to review all of your data initially and make sure that we have everything that we need. And then we'll proceed with the historical data loads.""
10. ""I know [PERSON-14] mentioned that the data gap filler a couple of times. But after we get the historical data loaded, it's typically very common that you've missed a couple of bills. There's some bills that you weren't able to get a hold of. So we'll use the data gap filler to make sure that we have a complete inventory.""
11. ""And then really go through the QA process and loading the data. You know, including that, the tool is really like it's ready to go, right? So now we got to get your team trained.""
12. ""So we do a number of different trainings on the tool. Those can be more administrative trainings from the IT perspective. It can also be the end-by-step-by-step end-user training, making sure that you know all the ins and outs of the tool and the platform.""
13. ""The other type of training that we do regularly do is just for individuals that might be at a particular site or a particular facility and they're going to be just entering data into the tool in the future.""
14. ""It's a more streamlined, simplified training just to make sure that they understand how to get the correct data entered.""
15. ""Is that like an overlay on top of the existing interface or how does",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"The customer expressed concerns about the affordability of the seller's product, stating that their primary concern was ""can I afford it?"" They also mentioned that they needed to have confidence in the fiscal feasibility of the conversation. However, they did not mention any specific issues or blockers related to the product or the seller that would prevent the deal from closing.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential for the seller's product to help them manage their sustainability data and meet regulatory requirements. They specifically mentioned the auditing capabilities, the ability to manage scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and the potential for the product to help them create a single source of truth for their sustainability data. They also appreciated the guidance and support provided by the seller's team. The customer also mentioned that they were interested in the product's ability to help them with their sustainability reporting and disclosures. Overall, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product would be a valuable tool for managing their sustainability efforts and ensuring compliance with regulations.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's budget and constraints. Although the customer did express concerns about affordability, the sales rep did not delve deeper into the customer's budget or explore potential solutions that could fit within their financial constraints.

2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's specific decarbonization and ESG goals. While the sales rep did mention that Green Impact can help raise the customer's scores with various reporting frameworks, they did not ask about the customer's specific goals or challenges in these areas.

3. The sales rep could have explored the customer's existing tech stack and integration needs in more detail. The customer mentioned the importance of integrations with their BI tool and other software, but the sales rep did not ask follow-up questions to understand the specifics of these requirements.

4. The sales rep could have provided more clarity on the roles and responsibilities of Green Impact and the Net Zero Cloud platform in managing ESG programs. The customer seemed to be seeking a more comprehensive solution that includes end-to-end program management, and the sales rep could have addressed this need more directly.

5. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's timeline and priorities for implementing the solution. While the sales rep did discuss potential implementation phases, they did not ask the customer about their preferred timeline or which features and capabilities they consider most critical.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly state that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did express interest in moving forward with a proposal and involving key budget approvers, including [PERSON-6], in further discussions. The customer also asked questions about the implementation process and the possibility of Green Impact having direct access to a production environment, which indicates a level of engagement and potential interest in the product. However, the customer also expressed concerns about costs and affordability, which might be a potential blocker in closing the deal."
video_19758_167_6qr3y000000odhrAAA,"Agent: The session.
Agent: I think off the back of our conversation on [DATE-1], I just really kind of wanted to segment and bucket into four different departments, kind of the back of our conversation and how I want the session [DATE-2] to flow.
Agent: Again, to make it more of an interactive session, it's completely up to yourselves. We can go start to finish and run a true.
Agent: If you want to jump in, ask questions, we go a little bit more granular and certain features and elements. We can also do that as well. I think that's what's loud and clear.
Agent: Where cube kitchens need to go to in that future stages having a single platform So it's having both the marketin g and that lead generation [ORG-1] and your sales system all sitting on the one platform And again, what you'll see between the two is tha t it's a real-time update between both system s so that lead generation elemen t is feeding information through to the sale s so that they're working in tandem with each other And you're essentially stitching both together The second element, and I think that we probabl y more of our time speaking around the marketing analytics.
Agent: So I want to talk you through t he out of the box reports that will be at the touch of your fingertips.
Agent: Again, you can understa nd where the ROI is coming from, where you're actually contributing to closing out deals. And I thi nk really importantly is understanding what's actually not generating revenue for the business.
Agent: So whe re can you stop focusing, empty energy or empty calories and completely remove them from any of your efforts that you're pushing out.
Agent: So we'll talk to how tho se I visualize the cost of the platform as we ll.
Agent: The third thing is that with the platform we can market on a one-to-one basis and yes, really important that we get personalized and how we're automating that and we'll talk through that.
Agent: But I think also how we're going to automate sending mass emails out a large volume of contacts.
Agent: So it's time to speed up that process and I want to talk you through how we can do that really easily with the platform.
Agent: And fourth and finally I think when you're coming from a world of [PRODUCT-1] and you're living in [DATE-3] out I think it's really important to have a platform.
Agent: That's going to give you a quick time to value So again, with a lot of the customers that we speak with they do see a return or some form of movement or uplif t within [DATE-4] of being stood up on the platform So again, hopefully that will be reflected back in the eas e of use within the system that it's very user friendly It's all clicks There's no code unless, of course, yo u want to bring that in But again, I think the key point her e is that it is that user intuitive kind of syste m and that you'll be able to to hit the ground running with us once it's up and runnin g. Just before I do jump into that from a starting point, I think coming up to the top of that marketing funnel and starting off that engagement, it's really understanding who you want to enter that marketing funnel with QKitchen.
Agent: So what we're suggesting is that we place the advertising studio on top of your [PRODUCT-2] system.
Agent: And when you take a look at [MONEY-1] a month that you're spending on these ads, what we want to start doing is using the contact information that sits on your website.
Agent: Your system so that you can start displaying ads in front of those look-alike audiences So again, we know for example that [PERSON-1] is our target audience He's who we want to be walking into our doors.
Agent: We want to be having the conversations with him We can direct dedicated ads back onto him from that perspective.
Agent: On the flip of that we can start suppressing audiences as well so we can suppress any kitchen competitor s that we know are in the lay of the line so we can suppress that email domain that they're no t increasing our cost per take and there's no waste that's been there from that [ORG-2], you can suppres s.
EndUser: The likes of it that's just ball with cute kitchen. But question there for you I suppose does that mean that we would have to I suppose in terms of creating audience we would have to generate personas.
EndUser: So we would probably need to do a bit of work. I've said no that's very I mean it's not as technical as it sounds I've done it before
Agent: That we would that mean that we would need to create the personas for our target market.
Agent: You can create independent personas and say, okay, I want this gender profile, this age demographic, you know, the specific object fields you want to drag into who's seeing what adds, but kind of as a front step, what you can do is we know [PERSON-2] is a closed one lead on our [ORG-3] system and we understand that he's a male, he's this age in this location.
EndUser: Profile, he's based
Agent: We can start to replicate those ads to go out in front of the identical [PERSON-3] network. across [ORG-4], [ORG-5], again Pinterest should you open up that platform as we discussed on [DATE-1] as well But be a second
Speaker 4: That will probably fall First and foremost is using the data that you already have .
Speaker 4: Or can I jump in there?
Speaker 4: So yeah, so I know what you mean, the lookalike audiences. I know [ORG-4] would offer that if you upload the database of leads that you that you know that you're like the right audience, I guess, to create lookalikes.
Speaker 4: Would you I'm just suggesting that these created within
Agent: Ads will be [ORG-3] or how is it?
Agent: I'm just thinking of technical part of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's a good way to be thinking because it's kind of putting yourself in the position of creating those.
Agent: So this platform is essentially a protection for who's seeing the ads. It's not creating the ads specifically. You'll still create them within your [ORG-4] platform or your LinkedIn profile or your [ORG-6].
Agent: Again, we can create [ORG-7] within the platform which I'll talk you through But what [ORG-8] is doing is that it's placing the a d in front of who you want to see i t or on the flip of that suppressing [ORG-9] y who shouldn't be seeing it So that you're getting a lot more hyp e or focused on who's coming into your marketing funne l and you're not having any of those time wasters .
Speaker 4: So, would I upload the database from [ORG-3] the different channels knowing that that's the audience that I to
Agent: Want to create, I look alike, audience?
Agent: So with this platform, the database will already be an integration and a plugin between the two.
Agent: And once this is set up, so again, you could set this up [DATE-5] and say, this is who I want to see, this specific campaign and this journey, and then you can have it running.
Agent: You don't need to touch it or edit it unless, of course, you want to change who's seeing unless this is all .
Speaker 4: You want to change the suppression
Agent: I can send you more information on this if you want to take a deeper step after the session because it's like you're I can tell already you've got kind of more of that technical mindset Yeah it's okay thanks.
Speaker 4: Where it's going as well so that's really good.
Agent: No worries so with that unless there's any other questions of course I want to jump into the back end of the platform and we'll talk you through what that looks like come to life.
Agent: Let me know and I just want to send a check mark that we are Recording the session.
Agent: Is [PERSON-4] with us?
Agent: I can't see you I am.
EndUser: Guys.
Agent: Yes, you are.
Agent: Sorry, you are. Sorry, Pajis.
Agent: Are we Recording the
Agent: Session yet?
Agent: Yes, yeah. Brilliant. So hopefully everybody can see my Yes, yeah.
Speaker 4: Screen. Okay.
Agent: Brilliant. So first and foremost, I'm going to walk us through kind of like in that golden tread scenario. So starting off kind of with a dashboard going into Content creation and moving through the automations and finishing up reports.
Agent: But first and foremost, from a starting point, I just want to show you this homepage. And again, past lady, you can customize this to specifically what you want to see.
Agent: I'm going to give you that high level overview in terms of what is available, but you can make these changes.
Agent: Changes based on what's a priority for yourselves Again, with the home screen, you may spend [TIME-1] of your [DATE-1] [TIME-2] [TIME-3], just to get an understanding of what's sitting in your marketing funnel what are we working with at this moment in time, what do we need to start progressing So it's kind of a level section in terms of how you're going to go about your day Again what I've pulled into this dashboard specifically is our pipeline deals So this is anything that's kind of in that [ORG-10] marketing qualification stage And again, watch your day find with these dashboards is that they're all interactive.
Agent: So again we can jump into what we' re prospecting at the moment, what [DATE-6] through was won, what's in discovery phase and we can s ee how many opportunities are sitting in each individual segment of the funne l. Again, we can start to understand the revenue by each individual campaign that we're running.
Agent: So again, you can determine a campaign as your brochure campaign, events, social media campaigns. You can break them down really granularly, but it's understanding what revenue is contributed from which campaign that you're actually running.
Agent: Now we will go into these reports in a lot more detail as we move through the demonstration, but it's just to give you that high-level overview and that sense of what that looks like.
Agent: These are work through boat marketing and sales. So it's giving you that 460 degree holistic view on that. [PERSON-5], I think really important for yourself is just understanding the actual list email engagement from that high level.
Agent: So again, you can see the click-through rates, the emails that you've sent, the hired balances.
Agent: Again, what we don't want to see is the opt-out number, but again, it's giving you that complete visual of what's happening with different emails that you're sending out. And then really important, and I think we kind of touch.
Agent: On [DATE-1] is you can understand which forms are actually the best performing. And so again, maybe part of we take back to the different door colours and what that looks like. You can create individual forms for that.
Agent: If you want to make it more style kitchen versus the contemporary style kitchen, we can see what's what's being compared against [ORG-8] and which is having the better performance.
EndUser: The classic
Agent: We can also see the landing page. So again, really high level. We will go into this in more detail, but I just want to pause and see if
EndUser: There's any questions on this or anything that's kind as well.
Speaker 4: Of standing out that would be of value to going forward
Agent: Lady, this will be all of your business. I don't. I actually want to go into the details. Yeah. I think let's move into the actual [ORG-7] side of it.
Agent: So this is really moving away from that [PRODUCT-1] document and how that's all working and how the prospects are going to flow through.
Agent: But for yourself, Lady, and again, I hope my demo work is going to be playing ball with me because it blocked me out earlier. fingers crossed.
Agent: But from this [ORG-7] tab perspective, what you can start to create is forms, form handlers, landing pages and social content.
Agent: Again, I'm going to give this [TIME-4] it will play well because I've been having a couple of errors.
Agent: And hopefully
Agent: The joys of the demo. That's the shoot-out technology connection down in Go. I wish I could blame the connection in Go. It's actually the demo work that's been acting up [DATE-7].
Agent: But yeah, so just jumping into the [ORG-7] side of it and looking at the specific landing pages. So we referenced the Q-Pitch and website and we're looking at landing pages here.
Agent: Lady, what you can start to do is create landing pages within the [ORG-3] system. So again, if it's an upcoming event that you're running and you want to have a conversation.
Agent: Contact me, form dedicated to that It's a really easy five-step proces s that you can just start to create that Again, from a permission-based standpoint you can lock in the top ribbon of what the CUBE Kitchen websit e looks like Again, we don't want to interfere or mess around with that But if there's an upcoming even t that you're going to be based in [GPE-1] we can actually create a landing page for tha t so that when you're pushing communications out to your prospects they can fill in their informatio n to secure their attendance on us Again, with these landing pages, what you see is it's very much what you see is what you get style layou t. Again, your imagery, you can change that around the content, you can move that to [GPE-2]: But what I want to focus in on here on the right hand side is your object field s. S o, if it's an upcoming event or if it's that brochure download, what we want to capture is the information of the insights.
Agent: So you can change these around and what we're starting to do is progressively profile the prospects, the customers and the existing contacts that we already have.
Agent: So for example, [PERSON-2] comes in, he downloads the classical brochure, if that's what these object fields are attributed to, and we start to capture his information.
Agent: What we're doing is we're taking [PERSON-4] from an unknown user and converting him to an unknown user. Thank you Thank you . What we can start to do here is introduce a concept called dynamic fields.
Agent: So with the dynamic fields on the back end, [PERSON-2] has given us his information in the first form.
Agent: If [PERSON-4] comes back in [DATE-8] time, we don't want to agree with the same set of questions that are going to be automatically filled because he's already a known user on our website, we can actually agree with a different set of questions.
Agent: So where are you based in [GPE-3]?
Agent: And what kind of kitchen are you interested in?
Agent: Are you a first time buyer or second time buyer?
Agent: And again, Again, what we can start to do here is really start to personalize the [ORG-7] and automat e that, but we're getting a better understanding of our prospects or our contacts who are [PERSON-6] on our landing pages, filling out brochures or.. .
Agent: Interested in attending different events. So hopefully that whole concept of progressive profiling and dynamic [ORG-7] feels make sense. I don't know.
Agent: Are there any questions on that?
EndUser: No, no,
Speaker 4: I think it's what I understand is the contact will be active on the system and it won't be duplicated if they fill out another form and another form and then you kind of will see the whole picture of that lead.
Speaker 4: It wouldn't be duplicated like it is at the moment probably because sometimes they don't know the brochure they receive an automated message but then they might book a consultation as well.
Speaker 4: [DATE-9], and then it's a duplicate message without considering that they already downloaded the brochure. sure, you know, like, yeah, completely.
Agent: So the system, it automatically [ORG-14] records So again, if [PERSON-2] has already come in, now again, the only instance that would the system wouldn't pick it up as if [PERSON-4] came in under two different email addresses.
Agent: So that' s something that you would have to watch out for, because the system's not going to know that [EMAIL] versus [EMAIL] . isn't the same person.
Agent: So again, you can set up the rules on the back of that how you want to deduplicate. And you can have the primary email address over the secondary one.
Agent: But again, I think with your use case and your scenario, typically you wouldn't have people coming in under two reason.
Speaker 4: Different email addresses. It'd be the rare
Agent: No, I'm from that perspective. I will jump into prospects and how we start to visualize the individual contacts from that perspective.
Agent: But while we're still sitting under the [ORG-7] heading, I just want to show you from the social perspective as well that you can jump in and start to create your social perspective.
Agent: And how you can create your social perspective. post from here as well. So again, we can embed our accounts via our [ORG-4], our LinkedIn and we can create our masterpiece over here on the right hand side.
Agent: When you start to ta g the individual campaigns, this is really just to help you from a reporting standpoint.
Agent: So again if you have it down as our [EVENT-1] upcoming sale or [DATE-10] campaign t o start to warm up existing leads, it's just a tracking mechanism that sits there.
Agent: Again you can insert your links, your attached image and again you can schedule it.
Agent: So, Lady, if I know you're working [DATE-8] and you're not worki ng [DATE-14], if you need a post to go out on [DATE-14] that you're not working, you can really easi ly just schedule the post to go out so that you can make sure the [ORG-7] is still going, even thou gh you might be kind of out on a [DATE-18] and then on a [PERSON-7] y. key concept with the social [ORG-7] is that you're still progressively profiling when you're pushing the [ORG-7] out who says for so if [PERSON-2] clicks on a social media that's sitting on [ORG-14] and has come out to your account engagement, he'll be progressively going to go and go and go and go and go and go to the system.
Agent: So if there's any questions on the social content, let me know. But I'll walk into the prospect view on what that looks like for the likes of [PERSON-2] or existing prospects.
Speaker 4: And I have a question there. So so would that do you mean that I will be scheduling [ORG-7] from that tab because I'm currently doing it from meta from the meta dashboard.
Speaker 4: So I scheduled [ORG-7] to his son, grandma [ORG-4] from that and in advance, you know, I don't want to do it the same day.
Speaker 4: And so in this case would it be, is that what you mean like scheduling from sales force.
Agent: So you can schedule your [ORG-18] and your [ORG-14] from the [ORG-18] platform. [ORG-5] and [ORG-13] have built walls that we essentially can't integrate. It's not a sales force issue.
Agent: It's those social platforms, again with [ORG-13] and the way they've moved. They've just completely shut the walls down and how you can do that.
Agent: But the difference with posting your [ORG-7] from the [ORG-3] platform is that if on LinkedIn or if on Facebook you've posted a campaign or a particular post, it'll bring them directly true to the [ORG-3] system as opposed to when they're posted to the independently o n Instagram from that post,
Speaker 4: You won't be able to actually plug them into the [ORG-3] platform and I'll show you what that looks like. Hopefully that makes sense.
Agent: Yeah, I think so you'll have some data from these people that click on that post specifically. Exactly. So I'll make sense of it now. So when we jump into a prospect, you can.
Agent: This is a prospect is anybody that's sitting in our marketing corner. They've not yet engaged from the sales perspective or that handshake or that handover has not yet happened.
Agent: And again, you can determine what that looks like and what that point of conversion is.
Agent: Is it if they've come in and had a conversation and they've they're genuinely interested in looking at a kitchen, or if it's potentially they've downloaded a brochure, I want them to go straight to sales.
Agent: You determine on the back of the system what that looks like. But when we go into a prospect you. So what was. starting to hear is to see here is a complete view of Mr. [PERSON-8] for example.
Agent: So [PERSON-9] we can go directly to his LinkedIn profile because I can see he has engaged with a [PRODUCT-3] n post that we've pushed out. We can see his salesforce contact record is here.
Agent: Again we can see his email and it has a green envelope. Great.
Agent: As you move down to that, it mean s that [PERSON-9] is essentially GDPR compliant and that he's opted in for promotional [ORG-7] and he's opted in for operational content.
Agent: So you can send t o to any email from the system, and it's a ll going to be managed from that [ORG-2], it's just protecting [ORG-18] from that whole [ORG-19] PR process, and that you're being vigilant on [PERSON-10] As we move down here, we can see the source campaign from [ORG-13] has actually entered the system fro m. So what this is telling me is that R on has come in from a [ORG-25], and that was the first point of contact [ORG-17] had with [PERSON-8] So again, it's giving us that [PERSON-14] And then as we look here on the right hand [PERSON-14] e, what this is telling m e. me is it's showing the accumulation of activity that [PERSON-9] has engaged with [PERSON-18] cute kitchen so be it as particular contact me form if it was a brochure the classical brochure this will all populate here across the activity line items t hat [PERSON-9] has engaged in.
Agent: What you'll notice is that each activity is going to be attributed to scores.
Agent: So again, past lady, you might decide that if somebody actually comes in store and has a one-to-one conversation, we want to give them a score of 111.
Agent: Or if they download a brochure, let's give them maybe a score of 64.
Agent: So you can really start to determine which are those high value call to actions that you're pushing out and how we can start to address what those prospects and how interested they are in buying as well.
Agent: With us and how we accumulate that is that you get an insight for each individual record. And again, just to break that down, we're getting both a score and a grade for these individual prospects.
Agent: What a score is going to tell Q [PERSON-14] is how interested [PERSON-9] is in Q Kitchens, again, to my point, that's all of the accumulation of activity that [PERSON-9] has engaged in over X amount of time.
Agent: What the grade is going to tell us is how interested Q Kitchens is in [PERSON-9]. So this really starts to give you back control in terms of who are those tire kickers.
Agent: Again, we know that you're looking at those.
Agent: High value consumers, those who's going after kind of those high-end kitchens You don't want to be going after somebody that's potentially just have a look for they'v e already bought a new built house that's in a house in the stage, for example So it's how you can start to actually put those high value customers up in the to p tier and then kind of dwindle out any of those tire-breakers, competitors, again sale s force employees doing a bit of research on your website before a demo So again, it's giving you full
Speaker 4: Access to the new product access to who's ready to buy as opposed to those who may be need further [PERSON-18] e. So hopefully you can see that concept. Yeah, yeah.
Agent: And is there an option to upload previous information that we've built already or not?
Agent: Just wondering. Yeah, so as long as I know you haven't sit in an [PRODUCT-1] at the moment, so as long as you have those columns mapped out on the [PRODUCT-1] document.
Agent: So again, if it's lady, you know your gender, you know your location, you know that you're interested in classical versus contemporary.
Speaker 4: If you have those mapped out on an [PRODUCT-1], the partner will be able to bake that into the system and give you the insights ready to go. ago. As long as you have a sheep and bacon.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I do have some.
Agent: Yeah, I think just jus t out of curiosity because we do have a lot of information and I feel like it's sittin g there and might get lost like at some point, you know.
Agent: Yeah, what I have seen work reall y well, particularly I suppose in the customer facing side of the market is that if you si t down with the sales reps or the sales guys and identify and understand from them wha t they see is a high value customer.
Agent: So again, they'll Thanks for watchin [PERSON-13]! They'll most likely say, okay, someone who's mortgage approved or who's ready to show their house is built, they're ready to put the kitchen in and they're [DATE-14] away from moving in.
Agent: Again, there's different criteria that they may call out, but if you sit down and understand that from them and then build that grading system together, it really does kind of stitch book marketing and sales together and they're going to benefit a lot more strongly from the leads that are pulling through.
Agent: So again, if they come back and say, lady, these leads aren't warm enough, like it's rubbish what you're dealing with at the moment.
Agent: You can always come back to the scoring system and say well, look, let's sit down and determine what you do want to see And at least I can structure my marketing in front of you And then I can work the ones that are maybe the [GPE-4] and F-grade .
Speaker 4: Aroun d how we're getting those top customers
Agent: Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. Okay. Any questions because I'm just conscious, there was a lot of
Speaker 4: Information covered in the actual prospect this view.
Agent: And again, is all kind of automatically funneling through from all of those activities, be it through the website. I have a question.
Speaker 4: Sorry, I have a question for you. Obviously, look at work across the very social media channels.
Speaker 4: Which one is your number one?
Speaker 4: Is it [ORG-4] or is it [ORG-5]?
Speaker 4: I think it's a will be more like [ORG-5] and [ORG-4], but I don't have a like a percentage that I could say. Yeah, that's one of the questions I have.
Speaker 4: So we probably would be able to see in general then what's the <inaudible> like.
Speaker 4: Like as an individual but also the whole database of leads, would you be able to see the analytics of okay what's the for the from leads to sales?
Agent: Tendency, you know, the trend there
EndUser: Users to convert
Speaker 4: Explain that again I just want to make sure I'm understanding the question.
Agent: Yeah the funnel that will tell us okay in general analytics of all the leads we've received this is the kind of path they are following.
Agent: Yeah I'll jump into the reporting and the analytics side of demonstration so I can show you again we probably started reports with finish reports and I'll show you all of those visuals that you can start to get a hold of.
EndUser: It as we move through the
Agent: Just quickly before I jump off of the prospect view and I think an important one, I suppose when you come back to detailing [NORP-1] strategy is actually understanding where we're getting spiked increase with cute kitchens and maybe where that starts to do.
Agent: So again, whether individual prospects we can take a look at the life cycle report.
Agent: So again, where they initially started their engagement and what that looked like, again, how many days it took them to actually come into our store, which is up here. Again, this is a demo organ. It's a really nice.
Agent: Graphic picture here, but you will see dips happening as well And that's really critical to understanding that why has it dipped Have they gone with a competitor Who was the competitor And again, it's just understanding that lifecycle journey of each individual prospect so w e can get a full holistic view in terms of what that looks like Again, you can start to get an understanding of your personas and that it will tell yo u how long that a particular lead was sitting in your journey before they actually commi t us to making a decision with [PRODUCT-4] kitchens as well So we can actually start to use it [DATE-18] on [DATE-13], [DATE-13] and then year on year to have structure and database fiel ds to make decisions and strategies going forward as [PERSON-13]
Agent: With this, I want to show you really easily how you can start a segment list. And I think this is going to be a massive time saver for you, lady.
Agent: Again, I'm going to jump into a hot prospect list that's already pre-built for the demo. But you will have all of your contacts sitting within the [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: And again, all that you need to do is create a new segmentation list. So this one is pulling out anyone that has a score greater than 90 or a grade greater than B. Again, you can remove those.
Agent: And you might specifically say, OK, I know that we've been doing that. event coming up in [GPE-1], I want to go after anybody that is specifically based .
Agent: In [GPE-1] and send them an email that we've been coming up in the [PERSON-18] on [DATE-18]. So again, we can really start to pinpoint who we want to go after.
Agent: Again, it might be a scenario or the use case we discussed that I want to go after anybody who's bought a kitchen with cute kitchens in [DATE-19] and we want to take a look and see can they look at any of the additional furniture that we have on offer within the [LOC-1] or so you can just pinpoint those as long as the information is in the system you just need to say this is who I want to go after pull and they're there in a matter of [TIME-5] and you can start to create the automation off the back of that and we'll go through that as well them out
EndUser: But you can see here
Speaker 4: Maybe the different filters that you can start to draw down from to pull those contacts out.
Agent: Very
EndUser: Good. Yeah, that'd be for me as a list to send the emails to them directly Exactly.
Speaker 4: From this.
EndUser: Yeah, but the difference here, I
Speaker 4: Guess, is that you're not in, if you're using [ORG-24], you're having to go into [PRODUCT-1]. I know. Yeah. And copy and paste as I did here. I never showed if the information is in trial.
EndUser: That I have
Speaker 4: Like I'm always kind of doubting if I have the most of recent information about that lead. Yes.
EndUser: Because we don't know if the managers are
Agent: Updating the Excels
Agent: Really quick. Yeah. We guess we suppose that they are, but sometimes there might be errors. Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: Ladies, you mentioned that last on our last call regarding that the managers take responsibility of, update and status in your in your [PRODUCT-1] document late.
Speaker 4: On a percentage wise, is it like [PERCENT-1] of branches are doing it?
Speaker 4: Is there like?
Speaker 4: Just so you have a figure?
Speaker 4: I know because they all have access so they will be updating and I can't tell who like, you know, who is updating what?
Speaker 4: I just go there and I can see
EndUser: It seems to be and a lot of trust in the process.
Agent: Updated, you know,
EndUser: Yeah, far too much and we don't trust them. Or mistrust.
EndUser: And that's why for [DATE-13], we're gonna actually take it on board ourselves and we're gonna contact the customers ourselves to understand what actually, what can be what we don't know is how, is that we're guessing, and assuming that they're engaging,
Agent: Done if you, because at the moment
Agent: We're hoping but we're not sure. So for [DATE-13] and [DATE-25] we're going to take it on board ourselves. I have a great report on that path that I'm going to show you.
Agent: It's going to help with that as well. So it's called the sales reps accountable. Yeah, I think it'll be possibly beneficial for you. So just going from the prospects, I do want to jump into the sales arc.
Agent: So again, you see everything is held in one place across the salesforce platform. I'm in marketing at the moment. I'm going to jump across into sales just keep me honest with time.
Agent: To give you a view of what that looks like. And again, [PERSON-4], I know you're going to jump into this in a little bit more detail. If we do have time to have [TIME-6],
Agent: That's the cover off [DATE-5], bits and pieces. So you folks aren't going to focus on you and I are probably going to hit in the seminar, bits and pieces. So. Crack on. Perfect.
Agent: So what you see is I just really easily jumped into our sales arc and I just want to show you the insights and the information that [ORG-13] is pushing through to sales at this point.
Agent: So again, when I go back into [PERSON-19], who's now been converted over to sales based on the activity and his interest in having a conversation, again, I can see straight away that score and that grade has been pulled through.
Agent: So I know as a sales rep, okay, this is a really hot lead. I need to strike while they are in touch and pick up the phone and make sure that we're getting that.
Agent: And a conversation in with this particular prospect But in addition to that I actually have engagement history dashboards as well So here we can filter down the timeline s for when we wanna see what that looks like But what's really important is that we can se e the activities over time So [DATE-17] activity has really started to <inaudible> e with this guy I can see exactly what he was looking at be it the contact me form the contemporary kitchen brochure He actually also attended an event in [GPE-1] So this is helping to come contribute to that warmer engaging conversation that I'm going to have when I pick up the phone to [PERSON-13] So instantly I have full insight on what you're interested i n. I could say, here on, I know you're interested in contemporary kitchen s. We actually have a really good deal going on with this at the momen t. We'd love to bring you in and map this out for you and what that's going to look like for your kitche n. When do you want to be i n?
Agent: Instead of, hi, this is, or are calling from a few kitchen s. It's just a little bit more static and [PERSON-25] Having insights is giving you more control over [ORG-18] And [PERSON-17] increasing your chances of having that increased customer journey as So hopefully that makes sense.
EndUser: We ll.
Agent: Again, in addition to that, you're also giving us sales reps access to when somebody was looking at a particular page. So again, I was looking at your website.
Agent: I don't think you have a pricing page specifically, but again, if it's the contemporary kitchen brochure, or if, for example, they bought their kitchen and they were looking at accessories on the east door, we can start to see when this has happened.
Agent: So again, they were looking at this particular form [TIME-7], maybe it was [TIME-8]. And it's a little bit of.
Agent: Probably big brother looking at what they're doing but what's really important is that you're going to strike while they are in the heart and if somebody is on your website you can pick up the phone and understand what they were that you can try and convert the deal as soon as possible.
EndUser: Looking at so
Agent: So with this, again, I know oftentimes when a lead maybe does progress over to sales and maybe it's somebody just having a nose, they're doing their market research on cute kitchens and they're not ready to actually meet with a consultant.
Agent: What we can get the sales team to do is actually to drop her on back to marketing.
Agent: So he's going back on an automated nurture journey as opposed to him going stagnant and going into what we call in sales force to lead graveyard, for example, just fall back into the marketing journey.
Agent: And then when he's actually ready to make it.
Agent: Decision or go with a particular vendor, he can actually see that Q Kitchen has bee n top of mind, he's been landing in my inbox I know tha t It's kind of the way I want to go.
Agent: And really, it's about that brand awareness for CUBE Kitchen and it's keeping yourself's
EndUser: Top of mind
Agent: For who your prospects are. Yep. Or just to jump in there, as well, the infamous sales perspective, [PERSON-24] and [PERSON-5], you can put in automated reminders and past management.
Agent: So that contact lead needs to be contacted in [DATE-24]. That can be popped up in the system.
Agent: Sales refer the branch we receive either an email or alert in the system on right here's your list to contact down among the on the ones that every week can be all built in to
Speaker 4: You can that measure.
EndUser: Flows not
Speaker 4: Love us.
Speaker 4: Will the sales people, could they enter that of people the showroom in that same platform?
Agent: Visiting
Speaker 4: So they will know if they visited and if they also
Agent: Fill out any type of forms and then we could have all in detail. Yeah, correct. So it was a bit under strategy.
Agent: How you're going to go forward is each branch would ideally, a branch manager would be the sales leader, so to manage that.
Agent: And you can either build out a QR code process where a customer could kind of cure in your shoe, QR code in your showroom, fill in the five.
Agent: Pieces of information that will automatically go into the lead and that could be assigned by the showroom location or if it's a personal trash to consider down and your store manager can sit down and that's creating that profile there on site on the [ORG-3] platform and capture all that information.
Agent: So yeah, there's a couple of ways to attack this.
EndUser: Well, the question for us, [PERSON-5], will be [PERSON-13], will If we were proceeding, who would engage with [ORG-3]?
Agent: Be who?
EndUser: Is it realistic to think that we would want all 56 or 45 designers working on [ORG-3]?
EndUser: Or is it a case that you would assign on a per branch basis?
EndUser: Maybe the branch manager might be the person who would be correct the sales with the [ORG-3] responsible for to platform.
Agent: Yeah, I've been thinking about this for [DATE-13], [DATE-18] of production. My goat, this tiny phase one would be...
Agent: However, the branch manager as your kind of lead person and says for stay manage that lead, make sure they're converted to the prospect and they're worked.
Agent: Going future kind of phase two phase three, ideally each person would design a road utilised salesforce as a single source of troops, manage your opportunities, your courts, your upside across and an integration to smart.
Agent: That's an entirely different type of project and business transformation in many ways from start to finish. But it has been done, but I've also signed the other approach going.
EndUser: I have seen it been done,
Agent: Our lead management is our biggest problem.
Agent: Let's fix that first, get that work and function and then go, right, what else can we do?
EndUser: Well, it's the other thing. Because there's also a cost aspect to it because obviously it's a I'm sure it's a license we're paying for users.
Agent: Based system. So Yes. Yeah, you're paying for users. So that's where store manager perspective.
EndUser: I'm coming from the
Agent: And I don't see any of your feedback or reason in terms So, and.
EndUser: Of cost and so forth.
Agent: Ok. Makes
EndUser: Sense.
Agent: With that, we jumped back into the marketing and I wanted to put into the automations. Again, I've had a preloaded because I didn't want the system to start freezing on me again, but we're in the automation section again.
Agent: This automation piece is essentially the beating character of the [ORG-18] platform. It's where you can really start to alleviate any of those manual efforts that, [PERSON-5], you're specifically spending a lot of time doing at the moment.
Agent: So, When we were back in marketing and before we jumped into sales, we finished off on how we were segmenting our audiences and how we were deciding who we wanted to go after.
Agent: So what I'm going to show you in this next phase is how we can start to automate the communications that are going out from [ORG-24], and again, that you can ensure that the Cogs are essentially working in the background and that you're just focusing on the actual [ORG-7] that's going out to the prospect.
Agent: So from this journey map or this journey trade, and that's how you'll see a flow is that we'll always have a start.
Agent: And again, there are so many use cases that you can start to run for this It can be somebody's filled out a contact me form and we want an instant email flow to go out or sales has just handed them back to marketing Again, your imagination can run <inaudible> in terms of what those use cases can look like But from a starting point, I'm going to do maybe an event follow up And again, we can decide what that recipient list looks like So we have our [ORG-4] leads that have signed up for that and how we want that to flow Again, really really important that we're not being <inaudible> or blind to our leads that are probably already engaged in the sales [PERSON-18] We can suppress the m. out as well.
Agent: We don't want our prospects being inundated with cube kitchen [ORG-7] either. The last thing marketing wants is opt-outs or any of those fall out rates to increase.
Agent: And again, coming back to [DATE-24] that you want these email flows to run. So he may understand from the data that [DATE-28] are just a no-go.
Agent: We get zero engagement from it, but I want this to run on [DATE-25] [DATE-28] [DATE-47]. Again, completely down to how you see the business getting the most engagement and what [DATE-24] are.
Agent: You can control that. And then again, Looking at the international market and again we didn't touch enough but let me know but you can send emails out to [GPE-5] again.
Agent: Don't want somebody receiving an email at [TIME-9] in [GPE-5] when it's [TIME-10] here so you can control the time. So that's this specific email [ORG-7] is going Just the curiosity anything internationally.
EndUser: Out as well. about your doing No, not just the [GPE-6] business. Perfect, you're safe, so with the [ORG-28]. Yeah, we're okay,
Agent: [ORG-25]'s on with. Perfect. So just as that flows down again what I would recommend is that you start to put yourself in the shoes of the customer. So we have that segmentation list.
Agent: We know where they're coming from and what we want to see is that they receive that first email. Again, we can start to bring in action.
Agent: So if they fill in the form to come in and meet a consultation, then I want one of our sales reps to get an instant note for gate knowledge and we can assign it to a specific user.
Agent: Now, you can assign this user on a round robin basis or you can assign it face some location.
Agent: You can assign it based on the quality of the lead, completely up to yourselves how you want that structur e and that process to flow, maybe a bit of fuel for thought and how you want that to work.
Agent: But again it's really easy to add in, okay, if somebody does this, then I want to do that.
Agent: And again you can end the journey, you can create a rule that if they fall below a certain grade, I don' t want them to go to sales. Again, there's so much you can do here.
Agent: My advice is to start small start with, okay, we receive an email, they fill out a form, we hand it to sales.
Agent: They don't we nurture them a little bit more and it's really dynamic in how that work s. So I'll show you just even from a test [ORG-28] e, we received that first emai l. They do fill out the for m, which again, can send them another emai l. If they don't, I want to add them to a different lis t, and start to nurture them furthe r, and end them on this webinar follow u p. So you can really control what's happenin g. The key thing here
Speaker 4: Is that it's automate d, and hopefully you can see that it's
EndUser: Really intuitiv e. It's just adding what you want that next action or
Speaker 4: Next step to b e. Yeah.
Speaker 4: What about this?
Speaker 4: This is like [DATE-10] has come early for ladies. So this is this that's it.
Agent: Is. And
Speaker 4: That's it. Definitely. I'm just thinking about now, for example, if the lead is coming from
Agent: Facebook lead forms, we'll have that like a plugin or something that will connect the leads from [ORG-4] to [ORG-3].
Agent: Yeah, so you can plug those in and if the leads fill out any of those forms that they'll automatically run through this journey flow if that's how you wanted to run on the back end.
Agent: Now, don't get worried about the training or the back end of it because the partner will hold your hand and show you how to actually structure these flows and how you want them to automatically run so again, you'll be up and running on that there'll be no issues and again, what would be probably good to do is start thinking about what are your probably top tree pressing journeys that you want to automate and that like even just think, why don't you have to set reminders for it to follow up on and that are probabl y falling through the cracks that you're missing out on .
Agent: Priorities and get them set up as soon as possible because then at least they can start running and you can make sure and you know that they're getting touch points from Q kitchen.
Agent: The other thing for yourself on this lady is that there is an individual report with each within every branch.
Agent: So you can understand if the email itself is performing well I can see how many have been sent how many have been opened what the click through rate looks like how many opt out we're getting so again if you're seeing that the opt out to the branch rates are really high.
Agent: You can really easily just go back into build and change Content It's important to note that if path was to flow through this and he's received tha t bad being performed email, he's not going to come [ORG-47] to the top.
Speaker 4: Out that email
Agent: The Boltzmann misse d his received that email and he's now maybe at this bottom
Speaker 4: Like in his journey . Exactly, yeah. No, that makes sense. But yeah, like at the moment, we're only doing one retargeting email, and we're stopping there because we don't have all this kind of background information about the leads.
Speaker 4: And it's really difficult to match one thing, one spreadsheet with the other to try to find out. So we could spend time on thinking through the journey and not downloading
EndUser: And uploading
Agent: Spreadsheets. Of course.
Agent: Yeah, I was actually thinking about it and I think one of the probably most beneficial use cases will be if we're Recording them as part of kitchen with you guys and make a rule that in [DATE-28] time after [DATE-24] or design update start to nurture me with Content on the you know the nice assets like the kitchen, the island, the couch, the bed, those different items that are on the east door as well because you'll figure out what those timelines look like but at least you know you're not panicking or trying to.
Agent: To make sure that I'm getting a touch point that I'm going to start that journey in [DATE-28] time anyways . and I'm receiving the Content when it's a timely [PERSON-24]. Oh, you have [TIME-8].
Agent: Ok, and you need [TIME-4]. I know I do pass the nitties. I'll record my path box. What you said, branch manager, or what path will see shared which you can watch at your own leisure then.
Agent: I'll do a short Recording 18 thank you for that.
EndUser: Minutes long and I'll share
Agent: What you have. Oh, No worries. For the time. Apologies just on the time, I there's so much to show.
EndUser: Just think
Agent: Other ideas. Other ideas. And I think they're really important aspects. Again, you can create your email content. That's really easy, drag and drop.
Agent: I can show you a little bit about that as well and we can share that with [GPE-7].
Agent: But what I really want to focus my time on is the analytics and I think path really important for yourself specifically in understanding where that growth is happening and maybe where it's going stagnant.
Agent: And again, ladies, this is going to tie into how you start to structure your marketing strategies as well.
Agent: So we started out the session with the marketing manager report and again you can see this in a broader view that we're understanding from that marketing manager aspect what that looks like again we will talk to the interactiveness of this as well .
Agent: What I think is really important to note is that you can really easily share these reports. So again, you can post it to a particular feed.
Agent: Maybe [PERSON-28], you want to give specific stakeholders access to these reports so they can understand what's happening.
Agent: Maybe you want to show us specific URL, or you can start to send these out in a static email, maybe a [TIME-14] on a [DATE-47] that everybody has full insights on where we're at any given time.
Agent: What I think is going to be really important for you guys is that when we look at the pipeline, so we can jump into the pipeline view.
Agent: And again, it's a numbers day essentially at [DATE-47]. We know you're dealing with high volumes that are coming onto the website and that are progressing true.
Agent: What we want to know is how many visitors do we need at the top of the funnel to get to X amount of closed one deals at the end of any given month or [DATE-13].
Agent: Again, it's how you structure your KPIs. But again, you'll see it's dissected down into visitors and prospects of MQLs, which will sit Lady with yourself, [ORG-24] and [ORG-28], which will sit with sales.
Agent: What I love about this is that you can put triggers in place that I'm going to set a notification to both yourself, [PERSON-28], and [PERSON-5], that if we fall below 446 MQLs, we're going to get an alert or a notification so that we know we're falling below the numbers we need to be at in our funnel.
Agent: We need to do an additional campaign, or we need to put more into our [ORG-24] app.
EndUser: Social
Agent: [PERSON-25] campaign . And again, it's really being proactive and how we're managing that cycle. Again, if we see the [ORG-10] score, great, it's going to have
EndUser: An impact on the closed one deals as well. So it's really trying to, I suppose, manage the way
Agent: The way it's getting done. All the [ORG-10] is marketing qualified lead and SQL is a sales qualified lead. Yeah, that's exactly.
Agent: So again, There'll be structures there and the partner will hold your hand and kind of what that looks like. If it's you can use terms that are more familiar to you guys as well.
Agent: You can remove segments of the pipeline full upon if it's irrelevant and it's a step too much. The key thing here is having that safety net and having full visibility
EndUser: And control over where numbers are dipping and where numbers are soaring. So, ladies, from our perspective, you think about what we've started to do this on a very, very small level.
EndUser: So, we're now targeting, for example, we're targeting 14,000 visitors to a website on a [DATE-46] basis. That's what we're And we're targeting [PERCENT-2] conversion.
Speaker 4: Targeting.
EndUser: So, we want [PERCENT-2] of those to convert into internet leads. So, we're looking to target 189 a month. And if we get 144... Now, that's the part that we can measure right now. or we after that it stops.
EndUser: So we know that we're gonna get it, we're gonna get it, let's say we get 185. If we get 146, that's your marketing qualified, let's your [ORG-10], let's your prospects probably even. Or is it [ORG-10], whichever.
EndUser: Anyway, the time it goes to, at the moment, then that goes to the [ORG-3], to the branches.
EndUser: And what we don't know at this point in time is of the 133, what happens next?
EndUser: Where do they go and how many end up in there are closed or one while at the end?
EndUser: So that's the visibility we don't have right now.
Agent: Let's jump into that. Again, there's a couple of other ones that I want to talk to as well. And again, you can understand the full cycle of what's closed one and what's currently in opportunity focus.
Agent: You'll also get insight into your engagement. So the different campaigns that you're running, how that's contributing to the emails that you've sent. What, again, often overlooked in marketing is the spam rate.
Agent: You may think that an email is, perform poorly but it might not even be landing in anybody's job folder.
EndUser: Inbox. It's going into that
Agent: So really important to understand that so that you can warm up your IP address, that [ORG-24], [ORG-47], [ORG-46], they all understand the Q kitchen email address and that can be configured as well.
Agent: So having that knowledge is really important to your own performance as well. Coming back to your point, [PERSON-24], and it's looking at the multi-touch attribution dashboard. So you're running all of these campaigns.
Agent: You want to understand what's generating the revenue for the business So you can filter down the implements model, the campaign that was run the actual contact within your own sales or that's managing those sales those sales opportunities that are coming true But we can see that [ORG-6] has contributed t o 350k and closed with one deals And again, this is managing all of that from all of those multi-touches .
Agent: You can see here our campaign on nurturing, for example, we've put 14,000 into it. That's what it's cost us. We're getting an ROI of [PERCENT-3].
Agent: So again, you can really see how that's going to be sliced out across the pie. What I think is going to be really important is that account-based marketing, Dashboard.
Agent: So you touched on it kind of earlier in the session and it's understanding who the individual contacts.
Agent: So again, these are done by business at the moment, but you could put down who the individual prospects are, if you work with a car, a mop, a lady or a conicam and we can see what the pipeline value is.
Agent: So we know what their budget is, what we're working with here, how high value they are, for example. But what's really important here is that you can see if the sales team are actually engaging.
Agent: So we can see by the sales event what they're doing. the score is on that individual account.
Agent: So if we put it into context, we know Mar k McCarmore a huge budget to spend on his kitchen And we know that.. .
EndUser: Because
Agent: Conversations that we've had with him. He's only had five sales events. So that's five two points from our sales team. In my opinion, as the business owner, that's not strong enough for somebody who has a huge budget.
Agent: They're willing to spend money here. They're definitely getting a lot more TLC with a different vendor.
Agent: So really important that you have always on that contact record and you can go to that individual contact who's managing that prospect and say, what's going on here?
EndUser: Why aren't you following up with them?
EndUser: Okay, so it allows you
Agent: To prioritize and focus on the, on the, yeah. Exactly. So you can base this on the budget that your individual prospect has to spend with you guys, or what the value of the opportunity essentially is in your system.
Agent: Again, you can see that engagement score by account as well. So that's from the marketing perspective. But I think to your point, [PERSON-28], it's understanding how this is team actually engaging with those champagne treatment type,
EndUser: Propensity to buy customers that you want to go after. Yes, so just leading, you probably wouldn't be aware of this. At the moment, we do have a pipeline or we have a forecast for the branches.
EndUser: So the way we work at right now is that obviously, we have what we call [DATE-46] and [PERCENT-4] is where we've taken the [PERCENT-5] deposit.
EndUser: So we're, unless something falls to the cracks, we're going to get that business. And then what we do is we take [DATE-46] and [DATE-46] is we take all those leads.
EndUser: Of those people who the sales people of the SQL, [ORG-46], who are engaged with, we assume that out the [DATE-46] we're going to convert [PERCENT-6] of those.
EndUser: It's kind of a something that the business has learned over [DATE-47]. So anybody who we're engaged with that hasn't actually paid us a deposit, we making a something that we're going to convert [PERCENT-6] of those
Agent: [PERCENT-7] probability leads. Okay, and
EndUser: How do we start to close the margin in on that and increase that?
EndUser: So the only way I suppose, no, they're [ORG-24]. So that would mean that those are people that we've had a face-to-face engagement in the branches.
EndUser: So that's more about the sales training and how we're presenting and engaging with the custom, which is a totally different piece, but that's something that we... that and we measure obviously hit rates and conversion rates there.
EndUser: So we once it moves from to SQL we have numbers and metrics around that right now using [ORG-47] BI. But I guess in this scenario here what you'd have is you'd have visibility on [ORG-10] efficiency
Agent: And SQL efficiency in one in one place. Yeah, the individual prospect that you're dealing with. And in addition to that, again, we're considering anyone that's put down a deposit. That's an opportunity in your system, essentially.
Agent: You can start to looks like, your clothes,
EndUser: See what your clothes want, lots of likes, and put down with that as well. Yeah, well, anybody who's put down a deposit is pretty much a sale. It's only it's only a timing.
EndUser: Usually there's nobody's going to couple of houses and
Agent: Give you a walk away. Yeah.
Agent: Very few, would know?
Agent: You Very few.
Agent: Yeah, definitely.
Agent: At that point, if you wanted the full overview, that's where you would use the full [ORG-3] platform.
EndUser: I agree. I agree. That's what I'm saying. And that's so.
Agent: So I right
EndUser: Now have visibility on that.
EndUser: So I have, in my personal, what we call the personal planners, I have visibility on that, on the sales, on what the salespeople are doing on a branch by branch basis as in [GPE-8] forecast, take [DATE-47].
EndUser: I have full visibility on that.
EndUser: [TIME-14] fully live at any point in time by [PERSON-28] so if I take if I just show you here what that SQL visibility looks like I stopped sharing there's yeah let me just I just share for well
Agent: One second I know I'm worth taking some of your time but we'll give it back to you
Agent: We've got to put it back in this I'm conscious we're I'm trying to time
EndUser: So and it's on your end if you know what we've got we've got next to tell it [TIME-18] let me see
Agent: If I can share that I do have a hard start but let me see can I just push
EndUser: Out for [TIME-14]?
Agent: So can you guys see
Agent: My screen
EndUser: Now?
EndUser: Yes, so what you see here, this is pulling for [ORG-47], so this is [PERSON-47]'s personal planner, okay, you met [PERSON-47].
EndUser: So this shows you the leads for [PERSON-24] which is the furniture and the kitchen business, what the target number leads, the action number leads to variants leads per year and so on.
EndUser: It shows you on [DATE-46] by [DATE-13] basis, it shows where [PERSON-47] is against his target, It shows the hit rates for projects over at 1477.
EndUser: So under 4607, can we kind of repair or recall remedials?
EndUser: So you see [PERSON-47] converts [PERCENT-8] at the moment on the basis of what he, the people he's mid-face to face and how many he's actually converting. He's actually converting off a lot more.
EndUser: Then you've got down to his live clients. Those are at [DATE-46], those are at [DATE-50]. I see the comments against us.
EndUser: And then we have the remedials, which is kitchens already installed where there might be a damage or a scratch. and then you'll see waiting to order, project is waiting, confirmation is one. So that's what person sees
Agent: An installation, so that's what each sales every morning when they log on. That's what onto them every morning.
EndUser: We put
Agent: That's
Agent: What you're working
EndUser: Active, customers are working active projects. The gap in behind that thing.
EndUser: Exactly, so for my, and that's what, so that as to where we are in terms of the time taken, it's on [DATE-36] to order and so on.
Agent: Gives you an idea
EndUser: So I suppose just by way of... And I should go back to the test, just stop sharing again. If I go back into Zoom, I don't know if I can Zoom here. So just by way of illustration.
EndUser: So from my perspective, like I said, lovely in all, as it would be to have [ORG-10] SQL integrated, I have full visibility. My concern is not the SQL piece, because I know what's happening there.
EndUser: Once we get people through the front over the threshold, then, and the salespeople are actually engaging face to face, then I think that's a pretty good door
Agent: Way we're on that.
EndUser: It's that piece at all is sure that's what's Yeah, I have to miss really in overall.
Agent: First piece. The [ORG-10] really... and gap
EndUser: If we get people through the door, then in most branches I'm confident that they'll convert that's not an issue. It's that first piece.
Speaker 4: I know you don't have time for it.
Agent: It's getting through the door, exactly. No, that's
Agent: Perfect. Are you okay for time or what I've
EndUser: Situation?
Agent: Just given them
EndUser: A [TIME-18] grade so I will have to do them in [TIME-13]. I don't
Agent: Know, no noise. This is the most important slide, the money. Yeah, but this is the indicative cost for a Q4 project.
Agent: Our Q4 in this generation, which you're well aware of since it's close, that's when it's going to go back in.
Agent: So it incorporates, I've got my 10 Sales Cloud licenses, because it will require a license for your branch managers to manage the whole lead to prospect and customer six stores and some management people.
EndUser: Requirements. So
Agent: And then all that has a sales force Account Engagement platform and then advertising studio platform. So, I'll share this afterwards. Well, list costs per year is 91,899, with a significant discount of [PERCENT-9] of coming in at [MONEY-2].
Agent: And if you decided to go pass and go, right, actually, I want everybody on board. I'll never be required. That says they're licensed. That discounts will change.
Agent: You know how we work our business, the number you buy, the higher the discount it is.
Agent: The Salesforce Account Engagement platform is sold as a business unit and so the advertising studio but [PERSON-5] will require a license while to manage those. So that's it in a nutshell.
Agent: They're about payest off a Q4 or [DATE-13] signature. I know timelines we need to probably firm in on but really the key thing for us going forward is to This course next steps and what they look like.
Agent: So you obviously probably need to take this back, get your heads around it, and figure out how you want to proceed. From our perspective, all this mentioned it, to raise partners.
Agent: When we mention partners, we recommend that each customer will bring an Implementation partner who are certified by [ORG-3] to do the build up.
Agent: So we don't just go, here lady, you crack on, you build this all out for yourself.
Agent: It's a partner who will come on board and do a lot of technical workshops, the school research itself, build out your requirements, set you up for success through getting the meeting. you return.
Agent: So the price we showed you is for the license cost .
Agent: For us to give you a partner cost, the next step will be to do a scope Recession with a partner based off that in requirements and their experience and our use case and our information.
Agent: They would go, right, here's your one off build cost. This is the same works. Here's the timelines, et cetera, et cetera.
EndUser: So, step, moving up to a couple of the money, then you're looking at those, those are partner There is, yeah.
Agent: Okay, for us, the next
Agent: Costs as well.
EndUser: So fee.
Agent: That's an [DATE-53]
EndUser: Without milling it to the cost.
Agent: If you look at
EndUser: What we're talking about there, let's assume we went to what you're proposing. We're looking at 50,000 being the sales force costs.
EndUser: What should we think about as being costs?
Agent: The partner To start basic, to start with the [ORG-10] piece only, to start with all of that. Or your about viewing this, but I'm not going to between
EndUser: Probably 14 and 13 to 13 two.
Agent: Now that's how long the pieces string answered, there's a lot of variations. Sure, that's a one-off bill cost, yeah. And you'd be up and running. I think project release, be up and running.
Agent: If you're available time-wise and there, and we get booked in and the lead time is there, to be up and running and function [DATE-55], if not quicker, could be four particular partner and their resources.
Agent: Within six
EndUser: [DATE-50] depending on the
Agent: That would change if you start adding in additional requirements and go, oh, this is a nice to have, nice to have, and I've seen projects happen. And we can go, oh, no, let's bring it back to being,
EndUser: Let's get you up and running. And that's a price off maybe a getting a quick start. Very out with the box functionality to your point, the [ORG-10] piece. Of course.
Agent: Ok, a favor,
EndUser: So far, listen, I know you're under time pressure.
EndUser: So can I ask [PERSON-4], will you record your piece, bang it up to my certain lady?
EndUser: And will you send us on the Recording that you of [DATE-2]'s piece as well?
EndUser: Because we'll obviously share it internally now with some of the rest of the team. [DATE-48]'s [DATE-46].
EndUser: So when are you guys finished?","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","The customer did not explicitly express whether the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did show interest in the product's features and asked several questions about its capabilities. They also mentioned some specific pain points they are experiencing, which the seller's product aims to address. It is likely that the customer is considering whether the product meets their needs, but a definitive answer cannot be determined from the transcript.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs when they discussed the use of the advertising studio on top of the customer's existing system. The rep mentioned using the contact information that sits on the website to start displaying ads in front of look-alike audiences, but they didn't delve deeper into the specific target audience, their preferences, or the customer's goals for these ads. Additionally, when discussing the use of dynamic fields, the rep didn't ask about the customer's current process for capturing and utilizing customer information, which could have helped tailor the demonstration to better fit the customer's needs.

Answer to this question is unclear:

- The transcript does not provide information about the customer's sentiment towards the sales call or their level of satisfaction with the proposed solution.
- There is no mention of concrete next steps or a clear agreement on the way forward.
- The transcript does not contain any mentions of competitors.
- It is unclear if there are any blockers from closing the deal, as the discussion is mostly focused on the features and capabilities of the seller's product.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. The customer expressed concern about the cost of implementing the seller's product and the associated partner costs. They mentioned a budget of around 13-14k for the initial phase, which is lower than the proposed sales force costs of 50,000.

2. The customer is uncertain about the value of the seller's product for their specific use case, as they already have a system in place for managing leads and prospects. They need to understand how the seller's product would improve their existing process.

3. The customer is unsure about the readiness of their team to adopt the new system, as it would require a significant change in their current workflow. They mentioned the need for sales training and improving the way they present and engage with customers.

4. The customer is concerned about the time commitment required to implement the seller's product, as they need to balance this with their ongoing business operations. They mentioned the need to firm up timelines and ensure a smooth onboarding process.

5. The customer needs to discuss the proposal with their team and consider the next steps before making a decision. They requested recordings of the call to share with their team for further review.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:
- ""What was your experience with the previous system you were using?""
- ""What specific features are you looking for in a new system?""
- ""How do you see this new system benefiting your business?""
- ""What are your pain points with your current system?""
- ""What is your timeline for implementing a new system?""

These questions help the sales rep understand the customer's needs and goals, as well as any challenges they may be facing with their current system. This information can then be used to tailor the sales pitch and demonstrate how the seller's product can meet the customer's specific needs.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer expressed concern about the time and effort required to create personas for lookalike audiences. They wanted to understand if they would need to generate personas themselves or if the platform would handle that.
2. The customer was unsure about the integration of their existing database with the platform, and whether they would need to upload the database from different channels manually.
3. The customer had questions about scheduling and publishing social media content from the platform, and whether it would be possible to schedule posts in advance.
4. The customer was interested in understanding the analytics of leads, such as the trend of leads converting to sales and the conversion rate from different social media channels.
5. The customer had concerns about the management of leads and the responsibility of updating the product information, as they had experienced issues with managers not updating the PRODUCT-1 document consistently.
6. The customer wanted to know if the branch managers would be responsible for managing the lead sales process on the platform or if all designers would need to engage with the platform.
7. The customer was interested in understanding the cost and licensing implications of implementing the platform across all branches.

Overall, the customer had concerns about the technical aspects of integrating the platform with their existing systems, the time and effort required to set up and manage the platform, and the cost implications of implementing the platform across all branches."
video_19759_167_6qr3y000000ocNhAAI,"Speaker 9: So that looks like, oh, thank you for recording. That looks like customer acquisition. That looks like automation and scalability of a repeatable sales process.
Speaker 9: Unifying sales, marketing account services, really getting that single source of truth, that single pane of glass of view across the business.
Speaker 9: Of course, data and analytics to be able to run that insight-driven decision-making, see what's actually working in these go-to-market strategies and focus on the winning strategies and not the ones that are less so.
Speaker 9: Enable a cross-sell up-sell motion and directly a part of that grow the sponsorship revenue stream.
Speaker 9: This is all stuff I've said to you by four or five times now, so I'll cruise it right along and I'll hand it over to [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] for a demo. Yeah, awesome.
Agent: We can quickly talk through just sort of what the flow will look like for [DATE-1].
Agent: So we're going to start with the marketing side, understanding how you can nurture leads that are coming in, make sure that you're qualifying them, make sure that your team doesn't have to do any of that manual effort that they're doing [DATE-1] when they're doing their Outreach for new individuals, as well as how you can use the marketing side to help with your existing customer base too.
Agent: We'll then sort of talk about the transition from marketing to the sales team. So again, since you'll have that automated.
Agent: And qualification process, how does that look and then how can sales use that data And then [PERSON-2] will kind of take it over from ther e and talk about what sort of that journe y will look like for the sales team So [PERSON-2], don't know if you have anything to ad d from your side there .
Agent: Nope, that's in it. Oh my God. Yeah, [PERSON-3], if you wanted to just like. Yeah, we'll kind of just walk through after [PERSON-1] does the marketing side.
Agent: I'll walk through really just the sales motion, full sales cycle, sales rep [ORG-1].
Agent: I'll touch on briefly what like customer support kind of looks like from a very high level and then wrap with sales executive [ORG-1] and some of that reporting in dashboards.
Speaker 9: Sounds good. That
Agent: I am going to relinquish control.
Agent: Awesome. And let's go ahead and get started. So again, we're gonna be starting off with the marketing side. We'll first talk about how this is one platform across marketing and sales.
Agent: We'll look at that data and how that data is shared. We'll then talk about how to use some of that data so that you can do your outreach, create [ORG-2] and automate your programs.
Agent: From there, we'll take a brief look at some reporting that comes out of the box on the marketing side specifically. And then again.
Agent: And we're gonna wrap up with how that transition happen s between marketing and sale s and how that data is shared on the sales side too Anything else you were hoping to see toda side specifically ?
EndUser: Y from the marketing
Agent: Or sound like a good plan for us all. Sounds good to me. Perfect. And want to keep this conversational.
Agent: I'll be pausing just to check in throughout, to make sure that we're on the right page and answering all of your questions or any specific use cases too.
Agent: But feel free to come off of you to ask a question. You can use the hand raise emoji at the bottom there. Or just put something in the chat function on the side there as well.
Agent: So I just want to make sure that we're touching on everything that you hope to see [DATE-1] and answering those questions. So let's go ahead and get started.
Agent: Here we are in the [ORG-3] platform So you'll see when [PERSON-2] transitions to her [PERSON-4] e that it is the same UI across marketing and sales You have one single login and that gives you acces s to all of your [ORG-3] instance so you can quickl y and easily switch back and forth between your different side s of [ORG-3] and perhaps more importantly too makes things very easy to learn since it's the same UI as well as you don't have to worry about managing data We use the same key metrics and objects across marketing and sale s. So we're looking at things like leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities, campaigns so th at you really get a holistic sense o f. what the journey of a lead looks like, how someone transitions into a customer, and how we can also then report on all of that.
Agent: Let's talk briefly about that data side of things quickly.
Agent: When it comes to the data, as mentioned, we're here more on the marketing side, but just wanted to re-highlight, you'll have access to those key data points across marketing and sales.
Agent: Here, for example, we have fields that we're monitoring, and you can use this data both on the sales side, to understand who you're engaging with, who people are, to account.
Agent: Or here on the marketing side in a similar way What's great is that if something updates on the sales side that will reflect here in marketing So you don't have to manage two systems It's one single system across that entire organization .
Agent: In addition though, to sort of that shared data, of course we have the marketing specific activities and that's kind of what I wanted to start off with.
Agent: Here you can see within the marketing side of [ORG-3], you can create and then monitor a variety of different types of content, things like forms, landing pages, social posts for [ORG-4] and [ORG-5], emails. We integrate with your website.
Agent: We integrate with [ORG-6]. So this really becomes a one-stop shop for any marketing efforts that you want to do. And what's really great too is that all of this is out-of-the-box functionality.
Agent: So you can pick and choose what you want to start with For example, you don't have to start by integrating with [ORG-6] from day one unles s you want to You can really just start off with doing some basic emails and keeping it simple right ou t of the gate And then you know, though, in the future, if you ever want to try anything, play aroun d with different things, you have that functionality available to you without having to worry t o add it on .
Agent: So I'll pause here quickly and just see if you have any questions, whether it be about how this is one platform across marketing and sales, that data sharing or any of those marketing specific activities that we've just talked through so far.
EndUser: Just to clarify, I think you clarified it, but I just want to make sure each of those different types of activities Correct.
Agent: Are included.
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: They're not add ons. Okay. No, correct. Yeah. So you can again have access to those forms, landing pages. The [ORG-4] and LinkedIn posting, emails, website integration, [ORG-6] integration, all of that is included out of the gate.
Agent: So again, though you don't have to start using it all right away, you can sort of build on top of your foundation. Great question though, [PERSON-5].
Agent: And so one last thing I just want to touch on is that because as you grow, you might have lots of different types of marketing activities that are happening.
Agent: In this case, as you can see our contact [PERSON-6], he's been doing a lot like filling out some forms, visiting the website and viewing.
Agent: Doing some pages, looking at some landing pages too you'll notice that some of these interaction s have a numerical value next to them That's what we call Lead Scoring This is really helpful to sort of div e into some of these activities so that you don't have to si t here and look at every single person in your databas e and try and figure out what's going on We give an overall Lead Score based off of that engagement So higher engagement, higher behavior and interaction So higher intent or higher interes t and having a conversation with the staff sales team.
Agent: So what's great about this is that [PERSON-5], you can use this on the marketing side to know when to pass the lead over to the sales tea m, works for existing customers too for things like upsells and [ORG-7] open existing customers on your site [PERSON-7] You know, hey, let's definitely reach out to them.
Agent: And the sales team can even create reports around this score information so that they can see from their account level who they need to be reaching out t o, or who maybe they haven't reached out to yet, that would be a good fi t. So lots of ways to use that activity and pay individual person's behavi or.
EndUser: Sort of [ORG-8] e. or use that attent ion to every Is that score customizable or is it customizable?
EndUser: It's absolutely customizable.
Agent: And I'm assuming there's a best practice for that you guys recommend to help us set that up and determine how we want to wait those?
Agent: Yes, [PERCENT-1]. So what's really nice is that we offer a scoring model right out of the box.
Agent: So [PERSON-5], you can just turn it on when you come onto account engagement, and you don't even have to worry about it.
Agent: If you do want to customize it, though, very easy to do, that's something that we have lots of resources.
Agent: On, but we always recommend, hey, if you're just starting out, try to be out of the bo x method because it's literally just a flip of the switch to get you started . Awesome, great questions.
Agent: Let's talk next about using this data.
Agent: So when it comes to that marketing and sales data, one of the things that we always wanna make sure we're paying attention to is who are we reaching out to?
Agent: You probably have different ways that you want to reach out to your different audiences, different sort of Messaging that you're going to have.
Agent: And so one of the easiest ways to support that is through what we call these dynamic lists. Now, these are rule-based lists.
Agent: So instead of you having to manually come back through and create a list every time you want to send out a message, what you do is you set up these criteria and then [ORG-9] does the work for you, finding everyone who fits these rules and constantly keeping it up to date.
Agent: So for example, in this.
Agent: In this case, we're pulling anybody who is in [GPE-1] s and who is a football team So again, that could be anybody from high schoo l college level through the [ORG-10] It makes sure too, as you find new peopl e who fit this criteria, [PERSON-5], you're not having to go bac k through and ask the sales team hey, do you find anybody else that we need to be reaching ou t to Again,
Agent: You set this up, let it run in the background and forget about it Go ahead, [PERSON-8], if you want to add something there too . Yeah.
Agent: So just thinking back about our previous conversations, [PERSON-9], [PERSON-10], I think this was in our whiteboarding session.
Agent: But this, I believe, there's challenges trying to get in touch with a certain person, right?
Agent: So because [ORG-13] for a modern lead team is different from a [ORG-13] for a major lead team, right?
Agent: So, This is specifically like in a dynamic list rule. Like this is where you can differentiate those target personas and you can reach out to them effectively.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Agent: I just wanted to
Agent: Make sure I put that out. This is kind of the area you would do that. Great. Awesome. Yeah, it makes sense. Perfect. Exactly the [PERSON-8]'s point. This can help build out those key personas.
Agent: What's also really nice too is that obviously, this works great for your new leads that are coming in. Somebody comes in through the website or comes in through [ORG-5].
Agent: You then don't have to try and figure out [PERSON-5], what type of message to send somebody or how do we want to interact with this person. But it also works really well with your existing customer base too.
Agent: For example, one really common one that we see is, hey, if- an opportunity closed .
Agent: [DATE-2], maybe we want to just send an automated message doing a check-in to see how things are going, making sure that things are on the right track, see if maybe there's even a reference that somebody has, so that you can make sure you're not just paying attention to those new leads that are coming in, but also what's happening across your organization for either open opportunities or close one opportunities to within your existing customer base.
Agent: So, really helpful. Yeah, great point [PERSON-8] about being able to use anything customized across the organization too.
Agent: Any questions here on creating these audiences, finding those key personas before we talk next about how to create some [ORG-2] and how to engage with this audience?
Agent: No?
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: Are we on the right track so far in terms of ease of use and functionality?
Agent: We are for [WORK_OF_ART-1] to hear that.
EndUser: Me. Perfect.
Agent: So let's talk next about [ORG-2] creation and then we'll sort of talk about how to automate that outreach.
Agent: When it comes to Content creation, [PERSON-5] know that we talked about this briefly already, but you have lots of different types of content. You can create forms, landing pages, social posts, email is what we're looking at here.
Agent: We offer this drag and drop email builder that is super easy to use if you've ever created a drag and drop or WYSIWYG email in any platform. This will feel very familiar.
Agent: But one thing that's really nice too is that we do even offer the ability to create just a plain text email message.
Agent: One thing that you can do, [PERSON-10], as you talked about how you're having to manually go i n and send out mass emails, you can even send out these text-space emails that look lik e they're coming directly from you, from the account owner, have any responses go directl y to you as the account owner So it adds that extra level of personalization, making things really nice and easy, but stil l have that flexibility to create beautiful branded marketing messages too And you can use both of those types of emails concurrently Well,
EndUser: Go ahead, [PERSON-13] with his email account as [PERSON-13] So will he be able to see that he sent that ema [PERSON-13] within his own emai l?
EndUser: Or will he only be
Agent: Able to see it in [ORG-13] e?
Agent: You'll see it in [ORG-3], but any responses from that email would go to your inbox, [PERSON-10].
Agent: And I'll show you what the team would see on the [PRODUCT-1] side, like on a day-to-day basis as a sales rep or account manager rep, that's very easy to see who's been sent to what.
Agent: When it comes to the Dragon Drop email, super easy to do, everything is desktop, tablet, and mobile responsive so you don't have to worry about creating different types of messages for if someone opens on their phone versus on their desktop.
Agent: You can come in and just use these columns to act as your framework, and then you have text, images, buttons, or even HTML you can pull in, and we also have that ability to still personalize these messages, all of those fields that we were talking about earlier So again, it could be something as simple as someone's first [PERSON-13] e or the account owner's name, but you could also pull in things lik e what team somebody is associated with or what sport someone' s associated with or location or if they came in through a referral who referred them, any of that data that's across marketing and sale s is fair game here.
Agent: So lots of flexibility to still have a detailed level of personalization even when you're sending a n
EndUser: Automated message So I'll pause any questions on the [ORG-2] creation side, [PERSON-5], or anyone else from the tea m. When you select those fields to identify your audience, do you have to create a specific flag the
Agent: List that meets that [NORP-1] a?
Agent: Or do you just matching criteria and it just automatically will just automatically pulls those peopl e?
EndUser: It pull those peopl [PERSON-16]. Thank [PERSON-17] For sure.
Agent: So as long as people are properly tagged that, yes, that becomes the system. That's the most important thing that you can find into that. Yeah, that's a great point. Obviously, we're pulling from your data.
Agent: So if something is tagged in correctly or has something wrong about the data input, then yes, it would pull that specific data point.
Agent: But there's lots of sort of situations to make sure that your data is up to date.
Agent: That's definitely something, again, being on one single platform really helps with because if something's updated on the [PRODUCT-1] side, you don't then have to manually go through and update it here on the marketing side or [PERSON-5], worry about things.
Agent: Being out of date, like let's say [PERSON-17] he's reaching out, he actually starts talking t o a potential opportunity.
Agent: You then don't have to go to [PERSON-10] and say, hey, who have you talked to [DATE-3]?
Agent: Is there anybody that I need to be following up with?
Agent: You can just have that list ready to go and it will constantly be updating into the messages
EndUser: And constantly pull in that information too. I have another question.
EndUser: Can you ask though, like an individual profile, can they have multiple tags?
EndUser: So for example, and this is the context that I'll give is I will send out and I'm on the account management side.
EndUser: So I send out Messaging sometimes to the account, multiple accounts or scaled Messaging at once, but then sometimes I might want to send it directly to my day-to-day point of contact, not necessarily a general.
EndUser: So I guess I guess I was back to the original question now that you have the context that an individual profile could have, you know, it's under a client account, under the proper service name, and then have another tag that I could put in as
Agent: Like, you know, my day-to-day or point of contact or that sort of thing identifier.
Agent: Yeah, and that's something that you can set up on the core [PRODUCT-1] side and something that [PERSON-2] will show, but you could either have it be a tag, you could identify someone as a key contact.
Agent: That's something that we do here internally at [ORG-3].
Agent: So that would, again, be information that you can share so that [PERSON-17], for example, if you didn't want any automated messages going out to your key contacts, because you just want to be able to own that relationship, and you could create a list that says, hey, I'll make sure to remove anyone who's a key contact.
Agent: So that we don't have to worry about them getting
EndUser: An automated message They just
EndUser: Get those messages directly from you, [PERSON-17] . And then just to clarify, when selecting again the criteria to send one of these emails out, we can choose from any of the tags that were designated
Agent: As well as any of the fields related to the contact.
Agent: Is that correct?
Agent: So just to clarify, we really focus on the field side of things and that's sort of the universal terminology that we use here at [ORG-3].
Agent: I think it'll make sense to you when you see the [PRODUCT-1] side and how those fields are shared.
Agent: But that's where you could come in and update again something like a ke y contact or say hey this is a key account or this is a you know not a key [PRODUCT-2] t so that's really where you would do that is all through those fields but tha t field information is accessible .
Agent: Here on the marketing side as well as on the
EndUser: Crm side, but the tags are not as far as
Agent: So So just to clarify again, let me let me make sure I'm understanding what you'd want those tags to be that would be like if someone is a key contact correct
EndUser: Well, or currently the way that we're set up in [GPE-2], but I think I understand. I've worked Okay.
Agent: In [ORG-3] before.
EndUser: If we want to be able to sort by it, we have to turn it into a field within the contact.
Agent: Is that correct?
Agent: Correct. Yeah, that's the way that it works is we don't really have that same separation of tags versus fields, just everything in [ORG-3] when you're looking at like
EndUser: Pretty much as a field a contact level.
EndUser: If you want to be able to sort by all of the minor within the southeastern regions of the we would have to actually put a league is the tag, the sub league is the tag or I guess, whatever the minor league is beneath the MILB organization and the region as well So we would just have to add fields for all MILB then
Agent: Of tha t to dilute down . Yes, it would be based off of the field. So like you see here, we could pull in something like someone's territory. So this could be, you team would be.
EndUser: Know, East
Agent: And so it's just the terminology as a field versus a tag.
Agent: But that would be something that would be set up during still customizable?
EndUser: Your Implementation process. And is what we call those fields Absolutely.
Agent: As you can see, this is a custom field. So you can create anything that's going to be unique to your business.
Agent: Like before call [DATE-1], I made one named team and then I also named took me [TIME-1] to do so very easy But yeah, just that tag versus field, it's just nomenclature.
EndUser: One. named sport
EndUser: And very flexible .
EndUser: Get into
Agent: The weeds. I just, no, it's good to understand that data side because again, it's important for that conversation across marketing and sales so that you know kind of how all this fits together. So glad that we clarified that.
Agent: Things also like that behavior score, for example, as well. So this is a really simple flow, sending out an email, and then paying attention to see how people engage with it.
Agent: After [DATE-4], if someone does click on this link, like maybe [PERSON-8] was part of this, and he did click on this message, will take him down this yes path, where we create a [ORG-3] task that will go to the person who's assigned to [PERSON-8] in your database so you don't have to try and run around and figure out who this needs to go to.
Agent: You can provide due dates and reminders for this task, and your team will get notified in [ORG-3].
Agent: And via email, and you can even continue that Outreach while you're waiting for the team to have that one-to-on e conversation, making things very easy and very flexible So you can build these out to be as sophisticated or as simpl e as you like I'll pause here Any questions on building out these flows ?
Agent: No, no. Awesome. Let's keep going and we can talk briefly about the reporting side and then we'll transition over to the sales side. So first off, you'll get tons of reporting out of the box.
Agent: We have [TIME-2] in out of the box reports for marketing, but just keep in mind too that you can of course create a custom report on any data points across your [ORG-3] org.
Agent: We have here though, a email newsletter that we sent out. So you have sort of those traditional marketing metrics like delivery rates to make sure it gets to people's inboxes.
Agent: Rates and how people are actually clicking on those emails too.
Agent: You can dive into specifi c information here as well and even come in and see things like how, who were those nine people wh o actually clicked on that [DATE-5] newsletter so that you can share this information with your sale s team or with your service team and make sure as well too that you're getting that engagement tha t you want to see with these messages.
Agent: Now in addition to sort of some of those mor e engagement focus metrics, we also can understand how thi s is directly impacting the sales [PERSON-17] So here, for example, I have a lifecycle repor [PERSON-26] So I can see from marketing how many new prospec ts I've generated, how many opportuniti es we've created from marketing, and how many of those opportuniti es are one, so understanding that closed one [PERSON-26]: Here, as you can see, we can see this marketing to sales [PERSON-26] So from visitors to your website through closed one opportunitie s, you can also track ROI so we can see the total amount of [PERSON-28] that you've driven, and what I also real ly like is this view of the velocity.
Agent: So how long it takes someone to move through t his marketing and sales funnel.
Agent: So if you are dealing with longer sales processes, try ing to shorten that by providing people information with marketing, making sure that they underst and what that journey will look like, understand some of the key points is really benefic ial to shorten those processes overa ll.
Agent: So I'll pause here.
Agent: Any questions on the sort of reporting side for marketing?
Agent: No, I just showed two reports of Keep in Mind. There's a lot that's available out of the box, but would be happy to answer any top of mind questions for you here. None me.
EndUser: On reporting for Okay.
Agent: And is this sort of in line with the reporting needs that you have from a marketing perspective?
EndUser: Um, it is we, um, for us right now, we, we track more in, um, more along the lines of our, our socials and way.
Agent: Our engagement that
EndUser: Um, then we do for email, but we do track our email as well, just through [GPE-2] and, and what we currently use. So it
Agent: Does. Perfect. Yes. Okay. Perfect. You will still also be able to track social posting as well too. So just wanted to highlight that as well, since you All of that is out of the box .
EndUser: Mentioned that. roubish the
Agent: New keyword.
Agent: Yeah, but as you're reporting needs of all, that's that's where we can kind of look into the B2B marketing analytics tool where you're getting multiple dashboard views across attribution in various models there and you can look at pipeline everything else that kind of comes with that as well.
EndUser: Okay, have it. Thank you.
Agent: Awesome, let's wrap up then with the sales side.
Agent: Before I transition it over to [PERSON-2] and she'll sort of walk you through [DATE-6], just wanted to show how this data is shared from marketing to the sales team.
Agent: So we already kind of talked about how, oops. We can alert the sales team and create a task when there's someone that they need to engage with.
Agent: And so as a sales rep, you can see here I am on the sales side, no longer in marketing, so I can just live here focusing on the CRM view.
Agent: I'll have information from marketing like that behavior score that we were talking about earlier, so I can create reports around this information, figure out who I need to be engaging with.
Agent: And I can also see what's happening behind the scenes with all of the different types of activities that every individual has been interacting with So here, for example, for [PERSON-6] , I can see spikes in his engagement with our marketing efforts.
Agent: I can see what type of Content he's been interacting with. I can also see what he's done most recently, which in this case was fill out a form.
Agent: But let's say that I want to know too if [PERSON-6] is going to be attending one of our upcoming webinars, I can actually click on that and it will show me that it looks like he did register for our upcoming webinar.
Agent: Maybe I'll make sure to give him a call, remind him about the webinar that's happening and follow up with him after it.
Agent: Happens to see if he has any additional questions so that every time I reach out, I'm reaching ou t with purpose, I'm reaching out with a warm conversation and helps the team across the board so tha t you know strategically what to start with.
Agent: You'll also be able to see this information at the [PRODUCT-2] t level too.
Agent: So if you're dealing with multiple people at an account, like those key contacts o r people who are new to you, you can see things like spikes and engagement for the account who at the account has engaged most recently or eve n come in and click on specific peop le to see right from this view what 's been going on before you hop on a call with [NORP-2] e. So it keeps things very easy, very organize d, and gives you, as a rep, lots of [PERSON-17], go ahea d. [PERSON-17]: How does something to add?
Agent: Yeah, I just wrote quickly.
Agent: I think it's good to note too, where it's like, [PERSON-10], you're the demo master, right?
Agent: And a lot of it comes on you to really showcase features and priorities that certain customers are holding in on for a specific solution you're putting together as part of [ORG-13].
Agent: But the idea around this is building up a [ORG-2] gallery, having that ability to just place it into an email, send it to that person, and have them be able to see it for themselves about you doing it.
Agent: It and then advancing them along in terms of their consideration so that you're not spendin g all your time doing that.
Agent: It's being automated and then you're still getting that same, i f not more, maximize output on the left .
Agent: Yeah, no, for sure. Like that.
EndUser: And I had one more question, [PERSON-1], before you shift all the way into sales.
Agent: Is there any kind of [ORG-2] management aspect to just the
EndUser: This as well beyond automated email?
EndUser: Yeah, what type of Content are you looking for?
EndUser: Are you talking about the website?
EndUser: Are you talking about white papers?
EndUser: Well, socials and any kind of campaigns that we might run that
Agent: Would have multiple elements to it with press releases and social posts and supporting content.
Agent: Do you have any, does this cover any of that?
Agent: Or is that completely separate?
Agent: Yeah, no. So again, you can do things like social posting for [ORG-5] and [ORG-4] directly in the marketing side.
Agent: Also again, create and monitor engagement on things like landing pages, white papers So if you're doing sort of one of these automated drip programs, maybe like you said for a n upcoming press release, you might have an email involved You can also then schedule a social post for that upcoming press release
EndUser: And then you can also make sure too that you're monitoring engagement on both that socia l post and the email that you're sending out to Is that where your heads at [PERSON-5]
Agent: No, I'm thinking more of.. of planning like marketing planning.
Agent: Is this more just the management of the data or is there a [GPE-3] kind of [ORG-2] planning?
EndUser: We do have a calendar that you can look at to understand like what upcomi ng posts you might have or what's going Is that what you're thinking of mor e?
Agent: On behind the scenes.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean if we're trying to plan initiatives
Agent: And we're looking at the calendar ahe ad and we're trying to organize where we want to place things and we want to release them and wh at Content we want to produce to support it.
Agent: It helps to be able to have that view. For sure. So this is the marketing calendar. Anything that you have schedu led or anything in the past will automatically be added to the marketing calendar.
Agent: So you could s ee, hey, we have an upcoming event and we have a social post coming out [DATE-7] before and t hen we're going follow up on [DATE-8].
EndUser: To have an email
Agent: So you can come into the market ing calendar to sort of see that full view of what's scheduled, what's happening, and also [ORG-13] data t oo. Got it. OK. Awesome.
Agent: Any final questions on the marketing side before we pass over to sales?
Agent: No,
Agent: Awesome, perfect. Well, [PERSON-2], I'll let you kind of take over and continue taking that point on from [PERSON-6]. Awesome. Thanks, [PERSON-1]. I'll head and share Please let me know when you can see it.
Speaker 9: My
EndUser: Screen.
Agent: We can see it. Good to see you. Perfect. So just taking over and picking right up from where [PERSON-1] left off. So now we're transitioning more towards the sales rep perspective.
Agent: So I know [PERSON-1] was just kind of showing an individual lead, but want to take a step back here and start on my home page, right?
Agent: Because as a sales rep, I log on to [ORG-3] for [DATE-7].
Agent: And the very first thing I want to see is really how I'm doing, right?
Agent: How am I ranking up against my team?
Agent: What is my pipeline and forecast look like?
Agent: Like how much business have I closed so far and then some of my top accounts over here on the left .
Agent: Over here on the right, I can also see my immediate tasks and events that I have for [DATE-7]. So if your [ORG-3] is connected to your [ORG-16], any of your [ORG-17] Calendar events can automatically sync into [ORG-3].
Agent: So then I don't have to swivel chair or bounce between multiple different tabs. I can just log on to my [ORG-3] and see everything I have to do and prioritize [DATE-1].
Agent: So if I scroll up here, the next thing I want to do is just jump into my leads list.
Agent: And these could be leads just as [PERSON-1] mentioned that have been qualified by marketing and they have received high scores.
Agent: And so these then are leads that we immediately want to go after because they are actively engaging with our marketing efforts and a positive.
Agent: So just to jump right into one lead specifically, that's a new lead I can see up here at the top, I can keep track of the status of all of my leads with this little path bar you'll see here.
Agent: And right below that, I can see some high level information. So looks like [PERSON-31] is the president of [ORG-17]. I have his phone number and email right here.
Agent: And if I scroll down a little bit more, You'll see I threw in just like a couple custom fields here to show you how easy it is to customize some fields But we know of course they're in The sports industry and then as far as organization.
Agent: I can go ahead and mark this as [ORG-10] And if there are any fields that you would want to see here Please let me know this is this page is totally custom all these fields are customizable So if there's certain information that you would want to store on your lead intake form Please let me know because that can absolutely be added i n and customized to what you're looking for .
Agent: And you'll see over here, I also, even as a salesperson, have some insight into my marketing efforts that are going on.
Agent: If I click on this little part dot tab, for example, I can see some of the engagement history. So before I reach out to [PERSON-6], I know he's already filled out the contact form on our website.
Agent: It looks like he signed up for our webinar. So he's actively engaging with some of our marketing efforts and on our website. So it's probably a good time to go ahead and get [PERSON-6] a call.
Agent: Ah, and So as soon as I start working this lead, of course, I want to mark it as working so tha t not only does it help me keep track, I can look at all of my working leads, but als o anyone else on my team or my manager knows that I've picked up this lead and I am activel y working it right now .
Agent: And so just as you can call, you can also email directly from [ORG-3] as well.
Agent: So if I want, I can go ahead and write out a customized email to [PERSON-6], or I can even go ahead and insert a template.
Agent: So in this case, I really want to get a meeting set to talk a little bit more about our product, maybe get a demo scheduled. So I went ahead and inserted an email template right here.
Agent: And I'm going to add in sometimes, for example. So if I want, I can go ahead and add in some availability from my [ORG-17] calendar right here. I'll go ahead and add a preferred times in this case.
Agent: But if I want, I can also add a scheduling link or add the next three available times into my email.
Agent: So if I go ahead and add preferred times, it will pull up my calendar and I can go ahead and offer a few different times, add those to the email.
Agent: And then once it's sent off to the customer, I'm sure you've seen [PERSON-3] do this for scheduling meetings, you can just click that link and it will automatically add to your calendar.
Agent: So And I can even show you what that looks like from [ORG-16], because you can do it in your inbox as well. But that's kind of just what it looks like from [ORG-3].
Agent: And as soon as I shoot off this email, it will automatically log the email on the activity timeline as well, so that when you're reporting on all of your sales reps activity, you can easily see all of the engagement they're doing, the emails being sent, the volume of calls, et cetera, all in one place.
Agent: Any questions on this piece so far?
Agent: Does this seem like something that would be helpful for keeping track of some of those leads from the sales perspective?
Agent: Yeah, no, it makes sense.
Agent: So can you do like flows from here, like where you're sending out email sets to groups of contacts?
Agent: Yeah, when you say email sets, could you elaborate a little bit more?
Agent: Like email steps, sorry. Like, so like, you know, step one, they receive this email to, you know, days from there, they receive this email.
Agent: Yeah, so yeah, [PERSON-8], great call out. So that's kind of what I was getting at with my question there.
Agent: We do offer, it's an add-on product to what I'm showing you right now, but it's called [ORG-17] that allows you to set up some of those cadences.
Agent: Is that really what you're looking for?
Agent: So it's kind of has like a flow or a process for your sales reps to follow.
Agent: Could be an email send, maybe a follow-up call, listen for [DATE-9], then do a... a different follow up, something along those lines . Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: We do have an additional product that checks that box and provides provides that capability. I don't the demo [DATE-1], but I'm happy to send over a pre Recorded video after this.
Agent: Have that pulled up for
Agent: If
EndUser: You can watch that, [PERSON-10]. Sounds good. Perfect.
EndUser: Um, does that work?
EndUser: Similarly to the marketing engage to that we that we work that
Agent: The account engage you just that she just showed us. Yeah, with the automation. It's not marketing automation. It's more sales automation. So part of is better.
Agent: Um, is more of a [ORG-17] tool, which is allowing you to target a large audience and handle all of that scoring. Um, whereas Sales engagement is a sales automation tool. So it's geared to help
Agent: Guide your sales rep through their sales motion in deal cycle.
Agent: Yeah, and I think just from this, just to clarify to a marketing perspective, the sales view what you're seeing is just if you are, if you have a specific account assigned to you and there's contact within an account that are engaging with your campaigns and emails from sent them or land in danger that they may have filled out information for, you're going to see that there and you're going to be able to act upon that through an email of your own or you can leverage a template through the [PERSON-26] database that is available for sales.
Agent: For the sales team, if that makes sense. That will allow you to be more
EndUser: Efficient in terms of what you're trying to reach out to and what specific [ORG-2] if that makes sense. Right. And they can see all of the Pardot that we've sent to them on the marketing
Agent: Activity. Anything
Agent: Side, he can see here on the sales side, Correct.
EndUser: Correct?
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: Yeah, so all the email, I just have a question. So all the email automation in this structure is on is through the marketing module. I think that's the difference here. Right.
EndUser: Email like those sequences and automation and sales automation. Not I'm hearing [PERSON-30] talk about process automation guiding through.
Agent: The sales.
EndUser: But what [PERSON-10]'s talking about are sending out sales automation emails, which in this case sounds like it's
Agent: More in the marketing tool. So,
Agent: You can automate Sales Emails still. It's just slightly different.
Agent: So in like [PERSON-1]'s example, we're trying to nurture some of these cold leads and you're sending them through these large email drip campaigns, you're using my automation to still send out those large, emails to those large groups that you're targeting.
Agent: However, once it passes over to the sales team, we do offer the capability to automate some of those Sales Emails in what [PERSON-10] was talking about. But it's not as much of like a mass [ORG-17] tool.
Agent: It's more so if I'm a sales rep and I have all of these marketing qualified I could throw them in a cadence.
EndUser: Leads,
Agent: Which just sends me things, yeah then helps me walk through each of those leads and know okay, the very first thing I want to do is send of f an automated email and then a follow-up call and then maybe
EndUser: [DATE-10]
Agent: A something, something I gotcha. Okay, great Okay. I can work together that the sales cadence side an d the [ORG-17] side lots of customers
EndUser: Use both of those But [PERSON-2] they differ .
Agent: Explained it perfectly of how Okay.
Agent: That's right. It does. Okay, cool. Great. And I'll send over a pre-recorded demo video of that. And if you guys wanted to see it live, I'd be happy to pull it up as well.
Agent: Just wanted to be conscious of time [DATE-1]. So moving right along here, let's say I speak with [PERSON-6]. I get that demo scheduled.
Agent: So I'm automatically now, after the demo's been scheduled, I'm considering [PERSON-6] no longer a lead, but an actual opportunity that I'm working. So I can go ahead. And if I click this convert button .
Agent: You'll see it's going to convert [PERSON-6] to an account, a contact, and an opportunity. But in this case, we already have [ORG-17] as an account. I don't want to create a duplicate account.
Agent: [PERSON-6]'s just a new lead or a new contact at this business for us. So in that case, I can actually choose from an existing account and just add him to that existing account.
Agent: So, whether you're converting leads, you can create a new account or just add them to existing to help avoid some of those duplicates there.
Agent: And when you convert a lead, it will also take all of that information, all of your notes, all of your history of engagement, and transfer it over to those records.
Agent: So, you never lose that history of engagement or progress that you've had with a lead.
Agent: And so after I've converted my leads and gone through my leads and made my touch points, the next thing I want to do is quickly review my pipeline. So I'm jumping over to my opportunities here.
Agent: You have a few different ways of looking at your opportunities, but I really like this [ORG-17] view. You'll see I have that brand new [ORG-26] core opportunity here in that qualification stage.
Agent: I can go ahead and move it over to the next stage, and it will automatically shift and shift. change my pipeline there. And if I want, I can go ahead and then just jump into this specific opportunity .
Agent: To show you what this could look like. Again, each page I'm showing you here is customizable. So if you want a different field, a different stage, totally up to you.
Agent: So since I just changed the status of this opportunity, it's now in the discovery phase. And you'll see down below, you can have some guidance for success.
Agent: So this is just going to help trigger your sales reps to follow a different process as their opportunities are progressing in this. sales cycle.
Agent: I know FAN Compass has a fairly long sales cycle [DATE-1] so I think having som e guidance for success for your sales reps during that period could just be helpful and these ar e really just tips .
Agent: And guidance while they're pushing these deals along. And down below, you'll see I have all of my details regarding the opportunity, the amount that it's tied to the account.
Agent: I have this little checkbox here, for example, that this demo is now being complete, so that box has been checked. And you'll see over here on the right, this is again where you can store any of the activity.
Agent: So if I have a phone call or I want to email the contacts I have for this deal, all of that can be done here on the opportunity as well. And the history. is all here too.
Agent: So I know I had a previous on site meeting. I have a follow up with the customer . And so all that engagement can be stored right there.
Agent: And as I'm progressing this deal along, I can also collaborate right on the opportunity. So if I want, I can tag, for example, my boss and say, meeting with this customer [DATE-1] to discuss pricing.
Agent: And again, that is then just stored right here on the record. They'll get a notification. She can respond right there. And it's all stored right on the deal.
Agent: As I, any questions on that piece so far before I keep moving along?
Agent: Be straightforward. Great. And just as I can store all of that other good information, I can also store specific contacts on this page too. And you can add their roles.
Agent: So in this case for this opportunity, I know I've been working with [PERSON-1] a lot. And so you can have those specific contacts there aligned with their work, too. So I know she's the ultimate decision maker.
Agent: So I want to flag that on the opportunity. So as I'm working the steel or even if I left the company [DATE-13],
Speaker 9: The next sales wrap who picked this up knows that they should be working with [PERSON-1], that she's the ultimate decision maker for this deal.
Speaker 9: I know one of the big challenges, the existing system is really having the lay of the land with like all of the people involved. Does this seem like that's going to solve
EndUser: That problem?
Agent: Say that one more time, please. I know that [PERSON-10]. Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I was my own unit. Yeah, no, I think that.
Agent: Because you know, you typically are talking to [ORG-17], but it could be involved with,
Agent: You could have like, you know, four or five contacts that you're talking with at the one team.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. And not only can you have your contacts and the contact role for each I actually jumped to the Green Bay Packers account.
Agent: Different opportunity,
Agent: This is where you can store all of the contacts that you might have. not even just specific to an opportunity, which I think is what you're getting at there, [PERSON-10].
Agent: So in this example, I'm looking at the Green Bay Packers account. I can store all of their different information on this page. If I go over to this contacts tab, I can see all of the different contacts here.
Agent: I could have hundreds of contacts, right, at one organization at some point. So just having a centralized place, they're all going to be tied back to this account.
Agent: And you can have their different titles, contact information, and the role they play as well .
Agent: And on top of that, since your contacts are a record for in [ORG-3], if you had a contact, let's say leave [ORG-17] and go to a different organization, they can still remain as a contact in [ORG-3] and you can have their [NORP-3] role as inactive.
Agent: And maybe they've moved over to
EndUser: The San Francisco 59ers. And now they are active. time to that account. Nice.
Agent: So we can see their history now because they move around so much.
Speaker 9: That would be great to be able to see where they've been and where they've gone. Yep, exactly. Yeah, that's exactly it.
Speaker 9: Anytime I have a new contact coming in to one of my accounts, the first thing I'm going to do is look them up at my [ORG-3] system, see where else they were, see what other opportunities they were tied to.
Speaker 9: And so I can see, oh, hey, [PERSON-26] came from [ORG-26] and we're on that company. She was tied to a marketing deal that went ahead and like was very successful.
Speaker 9: So I'm going to reach out to her knowing all this information and can utilize it.
Agent: Yeah, exactly, [PERSON-3], exactly. So just moving along here, you know, only in [TIME-3] left and I want to get to a couple more things.
Agent: So same thing, right?
Agent: If I go to sales, I can see all the past, present and future piped opportunities that I might have within account. So again, you maybe tried to go after an account [DATE-13].
Agent: It didn't work out. They didn't sign. You can still view that old opportunity as close loss, see what happened last time.
Agent: Um, and then if now you have a new opportunity with them, uh, you can open that up and you have all that background, that history, that contacts at your fingertips.
Agent: And if I jump over into the service tab, I know this isn't something we've spoken about a ton. Uh, bye.
Agent: [ORG-3] is a very flexible scalable tool The beauty of [ORG-3] is that it will scale with you as you grow If you ever want to then incorporate customer support, for example you can have all of your tickets like support tickets, we call them cases but if you want, you can rename that You can view all of that and handle all of that in [ORG-3] as well When I'm looking at an account I can see all my contacts, all my sales but I can also see any support issues they might have So I can see [PERSON-1] here submitted a ticke t. They have questions about a billing cycle or an issue with an [DATE-13] invoic e. So if I'm a sales rep and I see they have some customer support issues going o n, it immediately gives me visibility into the issues that my customer is [PERSON-30] and gives me kind of that holistic vie w. So I can better [PERSON-26] I can better approach our relationship with all of the contacts that I [PERSON-34]: Any thoughts on that piece so far?
Agent: I know we haven't really touched on the customer
EndUser: Support too much, but curious if that's something that kind of sparks some interest.
EndUser: Is that an add on to the sales of it?
Agent: Side
EndUser: No, no, so you can access cases.
Agent: Yeah, from your sales instance.
Agent: Does this integrate with QB and with [GPE-4]?
Agent: Great.
Agent: Yeah, but with online and with [GPE-5]
EndUser: Jira is one of our most integrated in apps to [PERSON-5]. So there shouldn't be too much of an issue there.
Agent: We continue the app exchange that [PERSON-10] would be the one that wants that I was just trying to tick off all the boxes.
EndUser: Link as well.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-5]. Yeah.
Agent: Jira and QuickBooks are definitely like two of the most common integration sites.
EndUser: And, [PERSON-9], our last wall you. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to get All of the functionality that you've shown us [DATE-1] is included in the pricing that you gave [PERSON-9].
Agent: It. That's all right.
EndUser: Is that correct?
EndUser: Correct.
EndUser: And one thing that I didn't see that I wanted to ask as we go through that onboarding process, we have assets delivered that the marketing team needs access to as we, you know, send them through that funnel and bring them out the other side.
EndUser: Is there a place for asset uploads and that type
Agent: Of thing that we can share between.
Agent: So marketing. Yes, you can absolutely, if you have existing content, move that over into the [ORG-3] platform.
Agent: And one thing you can also do is make certain email templates accessible to the sales team so that if you want them to be able to send out a customer story, a white paper, they can do that just from this view.
EndUser: If [PERSON-2] clicks the little email icon under activity there, there's templates that you can make accessible on the marketing side.
EndUser: So when we onboard them and they And part of their onboarding process is they deliver their logos to us .
EndUser: Am I able to take that in on the marketing side so that I can use it for socials and that type of stuff?
Agent: Yeah, you can store different images directly in the platform
EndUser: Different logos, assets, different so that you can use that in a variety of different content.
Agent: Again, you gave [PERSON-41]
EndUser: That's all encoded in the pricing that and all that's included. Awesome. Just confirming.
EndUser: Um, I know her question on her question. I'm there and I don't remember.
Speaker 9: Sorry, [PERSON-3], but is there a limit to the email distribution?
Agent: On the marketing side.
Agent: I think there was, right?
Agent: There is. I think [PERSON-8] is probably best equipped answer that one. So from an email sending limit, that's nothing you need to worry about.
Agent: What you need to worry about is a contact database with the communications that are being sent out.
EndUser: That's associated
Agent: Okay. So it comes out of the box of 10,000 contacts, [PERSON-9]. So that should suffice for now.
EndUser: I think But when you start a scale, would define additional blocks in volume to 10,000 each.
Agent: Then you
EndUser: And that's something that you know, we said that's all I needed to know for now. That's good. And then the other question that I have is back to sort of those, I think probably kind of looking.
Agent: You call them cases. And this is
EndUser: Where [PERSON-17] is
EndUser: Because the case is that kind of moves into more of a customer success piece, right?
EndUser: And then I know [PERSON-3], you said we're going to touch on that a little bit, but then there's a whole another like, it's sort of like within our framework.
EndUser: I'd like [PERSON-17] to know what he would have access to at this stage and then even just give
Speaker 9: Him a pre-not you know Not a demo but like just an idea of what would be the net like down the road map for him For customer success Yeah, so I think my understanding was we probably start [PERSON-17] within this platform and I can share some like full blown Service Cloud information with you guys.
Speaker 9: Service cloud is certainly more oriented towards being a like actual like customer service center kind of a solution. And either you're pulling something up here.
Agent: Yeah, I just pulled out, I think this would maybe help explain. So pulled up that case, for example.
EndUser: I just
Agent: So this is an example layout of a ticket, for example. that might be tightly counted on.
Agent: So questions about a specific billing cycle and you can see the details ticket and all of that good information, the account inside to the contact who submitted, et cetera.
EndUser: Over here regarding the
Agent: So this is definitely customer support, color service.
EndUser: More geared towards like
Agent: And this would be even tied to JIRA. So if you have, if you wanna push from [ORG-3] to JIRA or vice versa, that could absolutely be done.
Agent: For the customer success I'd be curious to understand what areas really . Looking for what he wants his future date to be because customer success can mean different and we absolutely do have solution things to different organization
EndUser: So I think that's just another conversation we could definitely have For sure, and I don't have way time here [PERSON-3]'s right.
EndUser: I mean what we're looking at his own packaged up So I think it's more important for this conversation with [PERSON-17] to show the extent of what he would have access to so he can think about how he could leverage that.
EndUser: Even though it's not the full module or cloud or you know he's got other other things in his workflow,
Agent: How could he leverage this?
Agent: And I think it's really this with case it's the cases. If I'm thinking about this right like tickets almost. Yeah, yeah I would assume it would be mainly focused on like account management, managing accounts as well.
Agent: So I jump into my accounts with you just as you can keep track of all the leads. You can also keep track of all of your accounts like this.
Agent: So all my accounts for, well, I'm looking at just my topic accounts, but you can have different buckets, like filter saved. So you can easily organize all of your different accounts.
Agent: So if you're focused on customer success, managing your accounts, supporting This is one way to organize it so I can these existing accounts.
EndUser: See all of my top accounts and those teams.
EndUser: I'll just shout back into the rebate [PERSON-17], I thought it was
EndUser: Packers there.
Speaker 9: The active list, right?
Speaker 9: Yeah, exactly. That would be a good question. Okay. Yeah.
EndUser: [PERSON-17], does there anything we haven't shown you that you [DATE-1] that you would want out of the boss like day one?
Speaker 9: Well, that led a question. Give it all to me.
EndUser: New [PERSON-17]. I'm open to [PERSON-30] and we're [TIME-4] over time. Yeah.
EndUser: And I guess I just need to absorb more of it to be able to, you know, to really answer that. I think there's probably, I mean, I've worked with [ORG-3] in the past. So that helps.
EndUser: But I think that I would probably need to like poke around and. I don't know.
EndUser: I need to absorb more and just think about how I could make this work or how I build this into the Workflow that I have going on right now.
EndUser: I definitely see some topics and things that would help track and automate. So I've definitely seen a couple things but have to, you know, there's so
Speaker 9: Many different pieces
EndUser: Of the account. The comment that I have to do that I would have to think about that a little bit. Okay.
EndUser: And I'm going to help him here because he's actually in the throws of sort of transforming our customer success. So it's kind of premature. I think that's why he's struggling with the exact what he needs because
EndUser: He's actually doing that right now.
Speaker 9: Like what is our next generation of customer success look like, and then he can back into the tools. Yeah. Thank you. totally understand.
EndUser: And as I live a little
Speaker 10: Bit earlier, kind of the beauty of this is being able to back into your new processes on a very flexible system.
Speaker 10: I think, yeah, I think just to kind of end cap that to [PERSON-17], what [PERSON-43] showed you for cases, the way that I like to think about this is think of this as like post sales, anything post sales that you want to track.
Speaker 10: And you can have different case types, right?
Speaker 10: You can have inbound people asking you questions,
Agent: You can log in case. They can come out, fill it a form, it gets pushed to you, or it could be a product, like [PERSON-10] closes a deal, and I need to do onboarding.
Agent: It's still a case, but maybe have a different case type. Like, hey, here are the 10 things I need to do based on the product they bought. So that's what fields we want to track.
Agent: I think [PERSON-2] touched on it a little bit, and just that question, how easy is it to change this page?
Agent: One of the powerful things about this engine is, as you say, Hey, we have these different types of support type cases or a [ORG-26] minor league baseball teams are even different than major league baseball teams.
Agent: If I get a minor league team on here and we tag this minor league baseball team, [PERSON-10] closes a deal. We've got a different Workflow that comes out of that. Like that's, you know, from the onboarding perspective.
Agent: That's really what the case object is designed to do.
Agent: The thing that we were talking about in our last meeting and these are about, hey, what else is out there from service?
Agent: It's like, Hey, we need to build a community where they can come interact with us. We need a chat bot. We need, you know, like [NORP-4] products that
EndUser: Those types of things. Those are we call L2 products that would this.
EndUser: Sit on top of again, to what you just had been with.
EndUser: But
EndUser: We're not there yet. So we didn't want to show that. No, absolutely. I understand. I agree. With the cases is something like you said, and thank you for elaborating on that. That definitely helps.
EndUser: So like with the fills out that I've customized, then that would become a case like that would be external.
Agent: Cases, this could be a
Agent: Form that a customer Okay.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah. Because I have, you know, I have, you know, I have things I'm thinking of, you know, I have obviously teams communicating to me via email and that sort of thing.
EndUser: But I also like more like as of like right now, I use L site for what I call a campaign request form. So.
EndUser: Clients will tell me, hey, and I have to put certain criteria in there to get the information that I need in order to build their campaign for that.
EndUser: So [DATE-1], that's something I could tell you guys right now that would help automate tie into their profiles.
Agent: And
EndUser: And I
Agent: Guess, if those cases are something, I guess the question is, are those cases something that provide that?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So web-decase forms are super common by me. Most of my clients utilize them. And that allows your customers to be able to fill out that form and have it automatically generate your ticket. internally.
Agent: And I mean, you say, so you could go, you could even think future vision of having like a customer portal for all of your customers.
EndUser: That's maybe like even the simplest It's real.
Agent: It's real. And more. I can be built off of [ORG-3]. using like clicks, it can be a direct environment as well for your customers.
EndUser: Not code. So extension of your sales force
Agent: And then go to your previous plan is to have a portal like that. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And I can go to the partnerships. You know, I know we like spoke about brand partnerships and things like that.
Agent: If you want to, you can also have a partner portal, right?
EndUser: So you can have different audiences for So there's a lot these.
Agent: That you can do there. And that's within, that's a [ORG-3] product.
EndUser: Yeah, right.
Agent: It's not like third party.
EndUser: Correct. Yeah,
Agent: It's our product is called experience cloud.
EndUser: So just another cloud out there. But it is, yeah, directly on the [ORG-3] platform.
Agent: But he can do the forms within the cases as with what we're looking
EndUser: Currently
Agent: At, correct?
Agent: That'll give him started, right?
Agent: Absolutely. Absolutely. You can even build if you want.
Agent: Similarly to the to the JIRA question asked [PERSON-5] like, you know, and in what in, you know, Web the case are like one of the most common things that we have.
Agent: Even if you go to salesforce.com, there's you click on contact someone has the drop down menu.
Agent: It's like, what is your inquiry about?
Agent: Is it billing?
Agent: Is it sales?
Agent: Is it customer service?
Agent: Is it customer success?
Agent: That just routes to their, it's just a routing entry. Right.
Agent: So, uh, for you, it's like, hey, what is your inquiry about?
Agent: It's a sales request. We can route it to [PERSON-10] is an on.
Agent: Boarding around to you as a customer service, whatever Is it none of the above ?
EndUser: You know, general for maybe he goes to [PERSON-10], so he can read
Agent: It like, okay, this is actually a big deal when you bring him to whatever.
Speaker 9: Right. So you have a lot of options there. Okay, love it. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, we're [TIME-5] over at our time.
Speaker 9: Do we have [TIME-6] to pop up a roadmap?
Speaker 9: Sure, give you give you 103.
EndUser: Oh, no, I have an error.
Speaker 9: All right, we're back. Okay, so yeah, we're checking things off here. We've done our workshops, our readbacks. We talked scoping and talked about those free Implementation jump starts for able to secure for you.
Speaker 9: We've talked about budgets and investment and we've run through our demo here. I mean, [PERSON-39], you know, transparently, you know, next step here is the next probably [DATE-13].
Speaker 9: So I'm going to ask if you're ready to sign a contract.
Speaker 9: I'd ask, you know, what before then to be ready?
EndUser: Do we need to do
Speaker 9: Like, is there a conditions discussion we need to have or anything else outline.
EndUser: Yeah, I think [DATE-1] was important, as you know. So what I want to do is regroup.
EndUser: With the team here and kind of get their feedback offline, really kind of poke around the edges, which they did already with you guys to see, you know, how much, one, how they're going to utilize this, which I think they already know, but, you know, is this going to work for them?
EndUser: How, just get the feedback on how they see envisioning this?
EndUser: Because everybody, I mentioned [PERSON-17] is looking at, you know, transforming, they're all looking at transforming. That's what we're talking about. Thank you guys.
EndUser: So they need to sort of think about how they're thinking about [DATE-16] and their function and what they saw [DATE-1], if that makes sense. So I want them to digest this a little bit.
EndUser: We're going to talk on [DATE-17] about this.
EndUser: And then I think it's you and I or and whomever on the team on your side, going back and just after that feedback, having another discussion about, you know, you already gave me
Speaker 9: The pricing, but I don't know if you sent that to me. You know, I may not have.
Speaker 9: Let me follow this up with the Recording of this demo, my pricing information and a little bit more info for [PERSON-17] on the customer services side.
EndUser: And then yeah, we can grab [QUANTITY-1] of the chat [DATE-17]. Yeah, [DATE-17] is great, because then we can kind of bring all of that together.
EndUser: I can go back, because I mean, we did that quickly. You and [PERSON-47] and myself sort of like on the screen.
EndUser: And I've already, I mean, I look at the total total, but what I wanna do is really understand what's in
Speaker 9: That pricing now a little bit, get a little more granular, and we could do that [DATE-17]. And it'll be, I'll have more context after That sounds perfect.
EndUser: Talking to the team on [DATE-17].
Speaker 9: Then
EndUser: I'll
EndUser: Let you all go. [PERSON-5] enjoy your dinner. Everyone else. They drive we'll chat soon.
Agent: And yeah,
EndUser: Alright,",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of the company's product throughout the demo. They highlighted the benefits of having a single platform for marketing and sales, the ease of use and flexibility of the platform, the data sharing capabilities, and the automation of various marketing and sales tasks. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have further emphasized the value proposition. For example, when discussing the creation of dynamic lists, the sales rep could have highlighted how this feature can help the customer more effectively target their audience and reach out to potential leads. Additionally, when discussing the reporting capabilities, the sales rep could have emphasized how the platform can help the customer measure the success of their marketing and sales efforts and make data-driven decisions. Overall, while the sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition, there were a few missed opportunities to further emphasize the benefits of the platform.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question: ""Does this seem like that's going to solve the problem of having the lay of the land with all the people involved?""
   Engagement: The customer showed engagement by expressing that this was one of the big challenges they were facing and that this solution could potentially address it.

2. Question: ""Is there a limit to the email distribution on the marketing side?""
   Engagement: The customer seemed more engaged as they discussed the specifics of the email sending limit and how it would apply to their contact database.

3. Question: ""What areas is [PERSON-17] really looking for in customer success?""
   Engagement: The customer showed engagement by discussing their current customer success transformation and how the solution could potentially fit into their new processes. They also expressed interest in understanding more about the customer success features available in the future.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was that they needed time to regroup with their team, provide feedback, and digest the information presented during the demo. They also wanted to have a more granular understanding of the pricing. The customer agreed to have a follow-up discussion on a specific date ([DATE-17]). While they didn't explicitly express objections or agree to sign a contract, their willingness to have further discussions indicates some level of interest in the seller's product.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the decision maker was on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed interest in the unified platform that the seller's product offers, combining sales, marketing, and account services for a single source of truth. They also appreciated the automation and scalability of the repeatable sales process, as well as the ability to enable cross-sell and up-sell motions to grow the sponsorship revenue stream. The customer also mentioned the importance of data and analytics for insight-driven decision-making and the ability to run reports on the go-to-market strategies' effectiveness. However, the transcript does not provide specific features or aspects of the product that the customer got particularly excited about or felt would be most impactful.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's marketing reporting needs. The customer mentioned that they track more in socials and engagement than email, but the sales rep didn't delve deeper into the specific reporting requirements for the customer's marketing team.

2. The sales rep could have explored more about the customer's marketing planning process. The customer mentioned the need for a marketing calendar and planning features, but the sales rep didn't discuss any specific functionalities related to marketing planning within the platform.

3. Towards the end of the call, the customer mentioned that their team is in the process of transforming their customer success approach. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's future needs and how the platform could support those changes.

4. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with other CRM or marketing automation platforms to better understand their pain points and requirements.

5. The sales rep could have provided more information about the capabilities of the Sales Engagement tool, as the customer seemed interested in sales automation emails and cadences.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","The customer did not explicitly state that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did express interest in the product and its features, and asked several questions to better understand how it could fit into their workflow. They also mentioned that they have worked with the product in the past, which could indicate a level of comfort or familiarity with it. The customer did mention that they need time to digest the information and discuss it with their team before making a decision. Overall, while the customer did not explicitly say that the product meets their needs, they did not express any major concerns or objections during the call.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep asked several open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:

1. ""What are your reporting needs from a marketing perspective?""
2. ""Is this sort of in line with the reporting needs that you have from a marketing perspective?""
3. ""Does this seem like something that would be helpful for keeping track of some of those leads from the sales perspective?""
4. ""Can you do like flows from here, like where you're sending out email sets to groups of contacts?""
5. ""So, is more of a marketing planning. Is this more just the management of the data or is there a [GPE-3] kind of [ORG-2] planning?""

These questions allowed the sales rep to understand the customer's needs and requirements better, which can help in tailoring the product demonstration accordingly."
video_19760_167_6qr3y000000kAURAA2,"EndUser: I'm happy to
Agent: Kind of run through the deck and as we get into the demo, but [PERSON-1], I think the first couple of slides are yours. Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 7: Yeah. So we'll just kind of kick it off here, obviously. So thanks for throwing up the slides there. It just took the obviously recap on where we've gone.
Speaker 7: I know it's been a long time since we last got together with the digital team specific to some of the conversations we were having with the at-go electric team.
Speaker 7: That's sort of why we were here talking about energy and utilities cloud, because that was one of the outcomes of our team.
Speaker 7: Session thinking about not a short term recommendation by a n especially imagination, but something you guys should b e you know, thinking about and considering and exploring t o understand what are the differences between what you guy s already have from a core platform, versus the energy an d utility data model object model, etc.
Speaker 7: So we just want to spend [TIME-1] recapping some of the conversation we had ther e with [ORG-1] drug this conversation.
Speaker 7: Then we're goin g to pop over and book's going to showcase some of the th e capabilities there from the energy utility cloud overview talk about the data model We'll talk about some specific industry cloud [GPE-1] es with [ORG-2] and then look through the reference architectu re and talk a little bit about Integration strategi es and some of those best practice s. Then we'll have some time for [ORG-3] on where we will actually see it in actio n. Candidly, it's gonna be a lot more meat and potato es of some of the slides and data that we're gonna shar e. If you guys are all very familiar with [ORG-4] e, so I think that will be a fruitful [PERSON-2] may candidly run out of time her e. We don't have a lot of time, but we'll get through as much of the [PRODUCT-1] as possib le.
Speaker 7: And if we need some additional time, we'll hopefully be able to set aside some time and go through some additional questions in next ste ps. Yeah, that sounds fair to everyone.
EndUser: Yep. And I'm just going to say
Agent: Like the audience here on the acocytes, everyone in, you know, in digital rather than the business.
Agent: So like, I think that gives us free rain to go and get as technical as, you know, we want to indefinitely like bring your burning questions to the table.
Agent: And I think we'll focus more on that side of like, what is it?
Agent: What do you get?
Agent: What are the implications?
Agent: Kind of where is this going versus, you know, you're showing every different use case that this might have been.
Agent: So I think that the demo, I think, will be focused on showing you some examples so you get a feel of how this actually kind of looks like and work.
Agent: And yet, feel free to jump in at any point. That's perfect.
Speaker 7: So we're always going to put this line up, especially since we've got a little section for roadmap and future capabilities. Let's all remind ourselves that please make your purchase in your savings based off of generally unfailable products [DATE-1].
Speaker 7: And we thank you. I think most times we get out of these phone calls. [DATE-2], I really want to focus on a big thank you for joining us on a [DATE-3].
Speaker 7: I know that's always a bit of a challenge having these meetings on a [DATE-3], but I really, really appreciate everyone joining in that and participating [DATE-1]. And every day. especially like [DATE-4] are special so.
Speaker 7: So we'll go through here and talk a little bit about what we heard. Like I said, I'm not going to spend too much time, but just as a recap here.
Speaker 7: So obviously when we talked to the electric group, it really was surrounding the grid modernization and the customer experience program associated to grid mod, trying to help educate them on the best ways that they could really, really leverage [ORG-5].
Speaker 7: So they could achieve all the things that was on that roadmap that [ORG-6] had partnered with them on, talking about things like scalability, personalized experiences. I'm released for [DATE-5].
Speaker 7: The needs of that evolving customer expectation s and preferences at the entity transition take hold .
Speaker 7: So that was really the crux of what we were talking to them about, which sort of driven us here [DATE-1] to talk about energy and utilities.
Speaker 7: So if you go to that next slide again, it's kind of a combination of what we heard and then what they shared with us on the right-hand side.
Speaker 7: That's the diagram they shared with us, right?
Speaker 7: It was thinking about all the channels, thinking about spaces and devices, about energy services and energy relationships, and really putting the customer at the center of all of that.
Speaker 7: Thinking about ways of deploying that from capabilities so that we could deliver personalized and seamless experiences through portals, through self-service pools, et cetera. And then while doing that, making sure that we really focused on that operational efficiency
Speaker 7: Using automation, I'm using analytics and actionable insights.
Speaker 7: And then you don't finally think about all of the things that come with the customer 280, that energy empowerment so that we can really create more of that competitive situation, creating energy advisors that have that full 287 review of the individuals that they're speaking to.
Speaker 7: So that, again, just as a recap, kind of what's driven us here.
Speaker 7: And obviously, it comes in and fits very nicely with our own value problem of really putting the customer at the center of everything that we do there.
Speaker 7: Before we pop into the next piece, again, that was just a refresher, but I know I've burned through it based on time.
Speaker 7: Any questions, comments?
Speaker 7: I see [PERSON-3] shaking his head. So I guess, saw that we will take his, Good to know that.
Agent: Yeah, and maybe as we get into a little bit more of like energy and utilities cloud, you know, when we did have that conversation with the business, I know that there was some trepidation like, wait, did [ORG-5] make any recommendations around kind of you [ORG-7] or how was that positioned?
Agent: Kind of you how that was positioned in the, you know, in that meeting was, this is something you should be aware of [ORG-5]'s industry strategy and what we're doing, but we're not even sure that this would fit for this particular project.
Agent: So we want to make sure that we can engage in conversations with digital.
Agent: You'll see how this aligns with your own strategy what you built, migration path, all that good stuff So I think that can dovetail into where we're at now .
Agent: For those who may not be aware of energy and utilities cloud and where it came from and the overall strategy. You may be familiar with velocity. Velocity was building industry clouds on top of [ORG-5].
Agent: So it's this [ORG-5] core that we're talking about building out templates that are specific to different industries.
Agent: [ORG-5], our own strategy for the past number of [DATE-6] has been to align with Industries into, you know, virtualize our solutions so that, you know, we have templates that are specific to each industry, can be proven, can be models increased, can be adoption, but we're still talking about [ORG-5] capital core here.
Agent: So some of what comes within energy and utilities, you know, cloud, it's just some of the features and capabilities.
Agent: So underlying this is a data model that is built ou t specifically for the utilities industry And we'll kind of get into that in the next section here But once we have that foundational data model we will configure apps So we're thinking, think lightning apps within [ORG-5] for multiple different use cases There's a can be a order managemen t and contract lifecycle management component to E and [PERSON-4] So that could be of use here.
Agent: It's actually competitive to combat in this way, but [ORG-8] lt directly within the clou d. There is an industry product catalog and CPU component that is separate from [ORG-5] CPU that kind of came from [GPE-2].
Agent: So there's some other options there where this is kind of built for industry. There's also underlying tools that we'll get into that's called [FAC-1]. So complementing what's available in [FAC-2] web components and so forth.
Agent: Relying technologies are only available within the industry clouds.
Agent: So any kind of questions so far?
Agent: So strategically, I think this is kind of interesting to go and look at what our strategy is and where [ORG-9] is at as they're looking at the grid modernization project. So like, you know, you're.
Agent: Previous world, oftentimes what we find, especially in utilities, is that they would do analysis for one particular use case, and then they would slice that down vertically and not think about the big picture architecture as part of that vision.
Agent: Our vision with [ORG-5] has always been to go and have a unified layer of engagement that can go and sit on top of back office systems. So we're thinking about the, you know, you know, [ORG-10], you know, system.
Agent: Comb s
Agent: And plugging into those, but presenting a unified layer of engagement that sits on top of all of those.
Agent: So, as we look at that, it's actually quite interesting to compare that to what we've seen from [ORG-8] and the work that we can view E and Y. So this slide here was taken directly from that evaluation.
Agent: Maybe helpful to go and just situate ourselves in kind of how the utilities seems to be looking at this.
Agent: So if we're looking at the right-hand side there under the customer operational systems, you'll see [ORG-15], engagement platform, [PRODUCT-2], portal, feedback management, these are all kind of capabilities that are aligned very closely to much of what you have kind of already.
Agent: So we would see that being assigned to [ORG-5] [PRODUCT-2]. either based off of the kind of your org that you have already, or potentially using energy utilities cloud as the foundation of that.
Agent: On the top there, we've been looking at connecting together all the data, having unified reporting from all of these systems.
Agent: It's separate from what we're talking about with E and [GPE-3] I think it was an excellent fit for [GPE-4] and potentially even data cloud.
Agent: And I think also looking at the integrations there, any consideration of [NORP-1] as that Integration layer.
Agent: So hopefully this is helpful to contextualize some of what we're talking about and what we've seen from the [ORG-8] kind of grid modernization report and can map that to [ORG-5].
Agent: So I'm not sure if you've already been thinking along similar lines.
Agent: Not make sense
EndUser: To me. I don't think, well, I have, speaking for myself, I haven't been really drawn into any of this stuff yet.
EndUser: So I have a very, again, [QUANTITY-1] view of what's going on and understanding what they actually want to do. But though it makes sense to me.
Agent: Yeah. And it'd be great, like, as you have the opportunity opportunity to obviously get plugged into that, see where that process is, is that and you can what they might be thinking in terms of the technical architecture.
Agent: So, kind of getting into the data model, maybe before I get into that, [PERSON-5], maybe if you want to just come up mute and introduce yourselves, kind of great timing.
Agent: Yes, definitely. Hey, team.
Agent: Good
Agent: [TIME-2] everyone, my name is [PERSON-5] like a [LANGUAGE-1]. I'm part of [ORG-18] practice and have been around, both in the ecosystem of [ORG-5] and also utilities for a long, long time.
Agent: I'm just happy to be here supporting my fellow colleagues.
Agent: Awesome. Thank you, [PERSON-5]. So we have the right person here with [PERSON-5] given that he's implemented E&U Cloud in real-world scenarios.
Agent: So I think as we talk about the data model, applicability, could be a level of effort or even could be a migration paths. [PERSON-5]'s a great person to have here.
Agent: Let's start diving into the data model for energy in utilities cloud. So what we've done as part of the cloud is built out a very comprehensive data model that takes into account many common processes.
Agent: It's been tested across many implementations. So as we've run into various edge cases, we've been able to go and adapt and test this out.
Agent: The other piece is that this has been built in such a way that the... the data model maps very cleanly and nicel y to known data models coming out of the ERP space So looking at [ORG-15] in your case as well as SAP So it's coming up very well, documente d and architecturally sound So it gives a very strong starting poin t for any future work that you be doing And I think an interesting way to go and explore thi s is to go and look at one of the most common example s where this comes into place.
Agent: So if we're looking at the structure of of an account and how that maps to utilities.
Agent: And we're looking at, say, like [PERSON-6] data, there's a lot that goes into this, right?
Agent: So you have a premise, right?
Agent: Which is part of the model, which represents a physical location, such as a house or a business.
Agent: That premise may have one or more service points that would be connected in and this could apply for water, for gas and electric.
Agent: So in this case, we're talking about electric, but given that electric and gas are within the same org, could actually apply to both.
Agent: And then you'd have a meter, right?
Agent: And that meter can actually be swapped out from different points if we're thinking about [ORG-18] projects and being able to go and bring in increasing amounts of data.
Agent: I think It's very important that we have that modeled in a way that is future proof. But let's go and talk about the other side of it with a person. So this is an individual, can be a contact.
Agent: That contact could be part of one or more accounts.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So, you know, think about, you know, someone who might be, you have an elderly parent, and maybe they're on that account and they're handling the billing for that parent or may need to go and your phone in to take care of the business.
Agent: It's very helpful to go and you have that concept of a person that can be tied to multiple, you know, different accounts or even in scenarios where someone is involved within a business that's billed separately.
Agent: So you see we have kind of a relationship there between the consumer account and the service account.
Agent: So this is kind of the like foundational model for this, but like it's interesting to start to explore some of the edge cases and I'd be curious to go and hear how you've dealt with this in the past.
Agent: Oh, and then we have it. Yeah, then it's kind of your own by the commodity or non-comonomy services that are provided, but this can get quite complex very quickly. So yo u very common scenario.
Agent: Imagine you have two individuals in one household, right?
Agent: So, multiple persons within that consumer account or household.
Agent: But then, can you imagine that this individual, or one individual, owns two houses, so a vacation property or a rental property, right?
Agent: So being able to go and keep that relationship. Or perhaps you have individual that's going back to the example of an elderly grandmother that you're helping out, you may be authorized to access multiple different accounts.
Agent: So maybe I'll stop there.
Agent: Can there be any questions on this or a question around how you might be dealing with this already [DATE-1]?
EndUser: My question, how we deal with it [DATE-1] is we have, we don't use person accounts, right?
EndUser: We just have our standard ad Code account contacts, right?
EndUser: So we just have a record tape that's called residential.
EndUser: So is it the best process for the current org structure that we have, right?
Agent: Process?
Agent: No, but it's the best Because.
EndUser: With the person objects and with using actual person accounts.
EndUser: It's one and a half times storage size, right?
EndUser: I want you to turn it on, you can't turn it off.
EndUser: So it was just back in [DATE-7] when we implemented this stuff [DATE-8], we just had to have, we couldn't afford the technical debt it would cost.
Agent: Right.
Agent: And so is that something that's followed?
Agent: Like so my understanding is that previously the regulated utilities were within the main app cohort.
Agent: And more recently, they've now been split and they're entirely within their own org for utilities, is that correct?
Agent: Yes.
Agent: And so did the underlying design decisions can also carry over or was that Implementation more of a clean slate?
Agent: It was a clean
EndUser: Slate, but it carried over. Okay.
Agent: And I know one of the questions. Because in the utilities
EndUser: Org, they don't generally deal with, like they wouldn't deal with you, [PERSON-7].
EndUser: Unless you're like, I don't know, a farmer and you have to have a new, Uh, 10. [PRODUCT-3] line run through your property, or you need a new gas line run to a house that you put in the middle of [QUANTITY-2] plot.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Right?
Agent: That's the only
EndUser: Time that they would ever deal with you. For your [DATE-9] charges and stuff, you would go to your retailer of choice.
Agent: Yeah, and that's a good kind of a good comment that I was going to call out is like, some of this actually might be more applicable on the retail energy, you know, side versus kind of go regulated and then figuring out the connection between the two, right?
Agent: So I would imagine that on the right side you're much more concerned . the actual premise, the service point and the media data. Then that would be passed along to the retailer for the billing side.
Agent: I think just to add a victim from my end, so [PERSON-3], you not having person accounts currently, that shouldn't be an issue because I know we are calling it a person there, but it is really not a person account.
Agent: The one you see on the screen there right though it says person and we are just referring to like a physical person a contact so it is not a it is not a person account per se it just uses some of the properties of you know person account.
Agent: But for individuals typically when you do consumer account and for businesses you do business account It kind of blends in you know some of those topics, but if in your current or You have you know set up where in the person accounts are not being used for whatever reason You know rightfully so like you mentioned technical that can be one thing and at the same time You know cannot turn it off once it turn it on so that shouldn't be a you know, a big deal in terms of looking at the data model when you actually look at, you know, any transition plans.
Agent: Yeah, the other thing just kind of switching back to, you know, some of the scope of this [ORG-18] project, it does sound quite comprehensive in terms of the integrations that will be asked for in, you know, aggressive in terms of a [DATE-10] roadmap.
Agent: So I think it's a good idea to start looking at how might you approach some of those integrations, what are some of the implications so that we don't get into a situation, say [DATE-8] into the future, whether you realize, oh, no, we've accumulated a substantial amount of technical debt.
Agent: We're going to have some limitations on how we can evolve this.
Agent: And then you're stuck trying to go and rework that at that point in time versus I would imagine that it would be easier to do any of that rework earlier on now before that work so that it just can be a little bit more effective or a stronger foundation to start building from.
Agent: We also have to understand
EndUser: That this is just one small portion of the business. Right.
Agent: Correct. So we're
EndUser: Like all great in everything if they had their own work. Right. But we had to look at the trickle down effects for the other 8 businesses that are using sales force at [ORG-15] as well.
Agent: Correct. Right. So
EndUser: How am I like this idea?
EndUser: But I don't know. It's open. It's open to the debate internally.
Agent: Yeah, so yeah, and that's effectively all that we're asking for is like to go and have the education know what's available and then as you're thinking about that like broader overarching kind of your strategy that can you take that into into consideration and I know the other piece of that is kind of you know.
Agent: That ties in is you still want to go and have that Customer280 across all the business units.
Agent: And so if you start to have a different underlying data models between those different orgs, just assuming that you're splitting them out, how do you go and then can you bring that back together and have that cross-visibility between those orgs as I know consideration.
Agent: So [PERSON-8], I noticed that you have your head hand up and you're posting something in the chat as well. Yeah,
Agent: Absolutely. And it just goes back a couple of a few sentences.
Agent: But [PERSON-3], you mentioned that, you know, having that cut, how you set up customers in the in the utilities org is a little bit different because you guys don't touch the customer directly. It's handled by the retailers.
Agent: What about things like distributed generation or DIRs?
Agent: Whereby customers are going to start generating their own power using solar wind battery storage, and there's an opportunity to put that power back into the grid.
Agent: Who's going to manage that from an [ORG-15] standpoint?
Agent: Is that being managed by [ORG-18], or would that be handled by the individual and potentially roomy for those respective customers?
Agent: Energy, sorry, energy. That all
EndUser: Varies, right?
Agent: And if we want to go down that
EndUser: Road, then it depends on who the distributor is for that specific address.
Agent: If I use myself,
EndUser: For example, I am an [ORG-28] energy customer, I'm paying [ORG-28] energy for my electricity and gas.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So I'm buying my,
EndUser: I have solar on my house. However, it gets fed back into the grid through [GPE-5], my distributor.
Agent: Who is
Agent: Okay. So I get credits from [GPE-5],
EndUser: Which then apply to my Afco energy bill. So it's, it's very convoluted when we go down that route.
EndUser: Now, if it's somebody who's setting up like a kilowatt hour array on the backside of their farm, right, then, they would have to engage with the distributor.
EndUser: So if it's NMACs, if it's direct energy, if it's order, NMACs, [ORG-16], or [ORG-28], right, those are the three main ones, if it's any of those, they'd have to work with them.
EndUser: It has nothing directly to do with us.
Agent: Okay. But if
EndUser: It is an [ORG-28] electric customer, right, then that's considered a business engagement because of how large the project is.
Agent: Yeah, and then build on that, you know, level three [PRODUCT-4] charging. Again, I don't know how [PERSON-9] is going to get involved in that if [PERSON-9] is planning on getting involved in that business.
Agent: The only reason I bring these use cases up is because these are some of the differentiators of why E and [PRODUCT-5] would be more preferred over just traditional salesforce. But anyways, I don't want to derail the conversation.
Agent: When was it [DATE-15]?
EndUser: I looked at velocity and we went through it with [PERSON-9] energy.
Agent: Got it. Right. But at the time,
EndUser: We were not mature enough to move forward with it. And there was still some. I'll get that book just so I see hold ups that the business had.
EndUser: Not us, but velocity had some hold ups that they could not do that we needed them to do. So it just went to the wayside.
Agent: Yeah. And
EndUser: I think now is a good time. Exactly.
EndUser: [PERSON-7] has been saying now is a good time to re-present or re let's not say re-present, but re-introduce ad [LAW-1] to the E&E cloud to see what could possibly come in the future.
EndUser: Right?
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Perfect. Okay.
Agent: Yeah. Thanks, [PERSON-3].
Agent: It's a kind of a good call out, right?
Agent: Like [DATE-8], product was not quite as mature. Also not the same level of clarity where, you know, the sales force is now kind of, you know, to that industry strategy.
Agent: So a lot of it now is ensuring the broadest alignment around some of those goals, especially as we get into some like [ORG-28] use cases kind of moving forward.
Agent: And if you think about where we've gone in [DATE-18], where we'll be [DATE-15], right, that type of thing. Kind of keep on going here.
Agent: I think you get the idea though that many different permutations of what we've looked at here would apply to, could be to be commercial and industrial can use cases as well.
Agent: So this has been architected for all the different permutations and even could be a splitting off, could be a billing into its own account.
Agent: If we need to go and have separate billing accounts because there's different commercial entities, for example, that roll up to one primary business, that type of edge case.
Agent: Is put into account So you can see how all of that works [PERSON-5], I'm not sure if there's anythin g you want to go and talk about aroun d can you have other aspects of the data model So I know we've been focused on one area but that's not all there is to do it So as we get into, you know, give you products what products have been, give you activated you know, the billing for that, you know we have their own kind of use [ORG-30] that has its own underlying, you know, data model And this is something that we use ,
Agent: That they have some similar use cases.
Agent: Right, definitely, just to add to that, yeah, that's the other fetching part of the data model and the solution because it's not just the underlying data but even the processes when it comes to if we have any scenarios, especially dealing with we do want to sell some products or services related to products and then there is different pricing things to play around with and we want to create experiences for that in terms of enabling you know, service or self-sales for the customers through portals and all That is when, you know, the whole sales suite side of the data model also kind of unpacks that lets you do, you know, things like your, you know, the velocity, secret queue codes all the, you know, Code applications converting that into orders and contracts Again, you know, that is one thing also that you all can, you know, think of if there is, you know, any ad-coli, you know, business that actually does this as a busines s process wherein they do have have this side of either utility sales or anythi ng as a value added service, kind of like how we can look it up at an excellent energy or things like [PERSON-10] That's one thin g. And also just want to add a couple more sentences abou t. If we do have things that run with our developer s, contractors, and all, typically, any energy efficien cy programs or anything of that sort, wherein we kind of [PERSON-8] nt our contractors or developers [NORP-2] come in, give us an application that the application gets reviewed by [ORG-28] and then we approve and keep tabs on it.
Agent: So any of those application ba sed processes, they are also baked into the data model along with not just the back of its experiences, but even the front office, you know, self serv ice experiences, even fro m a B2B perspective.
Agent: So all that, it's a huge package in terms of just the use cases. It's more about where we want to start and what we want to unpack first.
Agent: But we just wanted to lay that vision out also for you saying, not just your call center or typical service console experiences. It just goes above and beyond that kind of how even [PERSON-7] mentioned about.
Agent: They've just one slice of it.
Agent: This sounds like maybe more of those, you know, CNI, you know, customers versus residential or more applicable on the, you know, retail, you know, sign, I think it's helpful to know.
Agent: The other part that, I mean, [PERSON-5] will kind of speak to is some of the foundational gift technologies that are only available within the industry cloud.
Agent: Yeah, definitely.
Agent: So
Agent: I think, you know, we don't have to again take a whole lot deeper into, you know, deeper into this. It looks like at also looked into some of [ORG-28] or at least velocity components.
Agent: But at least these four, I would say, kind of like the four legs on which all are industry solutions run. So the ones you see on the left-hand side, flex cards and [ORG-28] scripts, they are more about experiences.
Agent: So [ORG-28] scripts are kind of like our screen flows in sales force if you want to give whoever the user is, whether it is an internal user or external user, a guided experience in terms of duet.
Agent: Step one go to step two, that kind of approach then that's handled through on the scripts It is almost you can say an enhanced version of [ORG-4] e flow And then [ORG-28] are more about static data If there is some data, whether in a billing syste m or a third party system or an outage system which we want to really expose it to any sort of user but all they need is more for information now then [ORG-28] come in there The Integration process and data wra p just suggests the underlying Integration mechanism that help you go fetch that dat a, whether you're grabbing it from a single obje ct from within the [ORG-5] ecosyste m, industry cloud or non-industry clou d, versus if you really have to make out a ca ll to an external system and even get dat a, fetch data, things like [PERSON-10] So it just depends on based on the use cas e, which one of the approaches you us e, but you can kind of think of it as if we and you cloud is this rocke t, just these four are its boosters reall y.
Agent: So just from an omni studio [ORG-35] y ou.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-15]. I'm just sick of time. See time's quick. going quite quickly.
Agent: So I'll kind of breathe through some of this, but there are some very well-trodden Integration patterns that we have, considering those technologies, like data raptors and Integration procedures.
Agent: So we can go and leave this as a leave behind is if you want to go and explore those Integration patterns.
Agent: The primary thing is if we were to go and map E and [PRODUCT-5] to [ORG-15] as an example and we have the same.
Agent: Thing for SAP There's a very clear mapping between what you'v e seen in the E&U data model and what you would have in [ORG-15] So as you look to go and integrate those systems together that becomes quite clear So again, this is looking at the same thing but we're now looking at more than just [ORG-15] we're looking at [PERSON-8] as well, kind of your ArcGIS Typically, what we would see is that there' s a middleware that's in the middle that takes the Integration procedures that are sitting with in kind of E and [PRODUCT-5] that map to that data mode l. And then the middleware is kind of mapping th at directly to the kind of back office syste ms that you see on the righ t. I think where this gets very interesting is for tha t, that middleware where there's the mappin g, we've actually taken this a step further with [PERSON-18] So in [NORP-1], we do have somethi ng called [PERSON-15] And what we've actually built out is configuration for that middleware that takes all the guesswork around that integration.
Agent: So given that we know the model on the kind of [ORG-15] side, we know the model in Compute E and UCloud, those are well established and known.
Agent: [ORG-34] has a configuration for the middleware that you're starting with a template that just connects all those together.
Agent: So you'd have to go and extend that if you extend the E and U data model or you made changes on the kind of your [ORG-15] side.
Agent: But in terms of that, kind of out of the box configuration, with that [ORG-30] option that's available, you have those starting templates in the middleware side as well, which I think is a big de-risker also will help with any new.
Agent: The amount of work that's required is part of that Integration effort . if that's making sense.
Agent: Maybe just for [TIME-3] or so, I can provide a demonstration of E and [PRODUCT-5] if you'd like to go and see what this looks like and get a feel for it.
Agent: So can I get any questions or thoughts before I get into a live demonstration?
Agent: For a demonstration, what it'll use is a very simple use case. So imagine that you have an end customer. [PERSON-18], she's moving homes and you'd like to go and automate as much of that process as possible.
Agent: And [PERSON-18] is also looking at any other services that might be provided. So this might be more close to the retail energy side. So with this move, what we've heard is it's kind of a very.
Agent: A caveat common process might take a large portion of the time in terms of the numbe r of calls that you get into the call center.
Agent: So as much as possible, you'd like to go an d caveat automate this process.
Agent: But in the event that [PERSON-18] gets stuck during this self-servic e and needs to phone into the call center, what you want is for the call center agent to hav e exactly the same view as [PERSON-18] and to be able to go and pick up exactly where she left off.
Agent: S o I think this will pretty straightforward type of scenario s. So I'm just going to go and switch screens for a moment he re so you can go and see my demo environmen t.
Agent: So first off, for this demo environment, this was spun up from the default template that we have in [PRODUCT-5].
Agent: The only thing that I changed was actually literally just the colors to make it look like [ORG-15] and this banner here. Everything else that you're seeing is default out of the box energy utilities cloud.
Agent: So this will give you a good feel for what some of those templates look like and what they offer. So I'm logged in as [PERSON-18] within the website, a caveat experience.
Agent: You'll see here you have access to meter readings, bill payments, rate comparisons, all the things you might expect as a consumer. So [PERSON-18] goes and clicks into her account area.
Agent: And so as she can be loads up her account, you'll see some of the data model that we were talking about earlier with the premise model and the service points in action.
Agent: So we can go and see that she actually has her primary household, as well as a rental household here.
Agent: Everything around can be a billing and usage data that you might have available to agents within the [PRODUCT-2]'s automatically available within [PRODUCT-6]. and then on the right.
Agent: You can see some of the standard processes that we have available.
Agent: So energy utilities cloud comes with a process library that has starting points that you can go and use and adapt for the common processes that we see in a utility.
Agent: So it could be anything from rebate management, which has a lightning app that corresponds to it, scheduling appointment, which it connects into [ORG-35] and so on and so forth. So in this case, I want to go.
Agent: And transfer my service .
Agent: So this brings up a [PRODUCT-7], right?
Agent: So it's a template of [PRODUCT-7] with no changes to it. You can see that we have the different properties that [PERSON-18] has. In this case, she's moving from an apartment into a new building.
Agent: So we're going to go and select the apartment building. And let's say that she's going to move at [DATE-18]. So she's moving out of her house in [DATE-18].
Agent: She's going to move into the new place on [DATE-15]. 30st, so I'll say everything can be looks good. I'm just going to go and throw out a address here.
Agent: This works in [GPE-6], but for some of the data that's available within, you know, premises within the demo environment, is based off of the [GPE-7] data, so just work with the [GPE-7].
Agent: Have we had this for now?
Agent: Yeah, go ahead.
EndUser: Sorry, I think [GPE-7] data, but is that something we can hook up, let's say a [GPE-6] post or
Agent: You mentioned it with the
Agent: Something?
Agent: [PERCENT-1], yes. Yeah, so this here actually is pulling from the premise, you know, kind of your object.
Agent: I can go and show it on the [PRODUCT-2] side in a moment, right?
Agent: So imagine the list of all the premises that you have within [PERSON-9] could be integrated or imported into this.
Agent: And then we would look for a match and we can go and use [ORG-34] for validating those addresses, right?
Agent: So like in this case, It's actually is using a data raptor to go and see if there is a premise available in this case There is no premise match to say that the home isn't found right so we cannot go and hook up the [PRODUCT-8] to a home that is not within within our database.
Agent: So I know that there is a place in [GPE-8] that I think is 98 [FAC-3], [LOC-1] that is within the premise database. I'll use that instead and I should get this. Here we go.
Agent: You can see now that I go into the next stage within this [NORP-3]. We have conditional logic there. We've validated this is the premise that we want to go and use.
Agent: And just like that, the transfer of service kind of request is complete. We have everything that we need. We can create a record within [PRODUCT-2] or pass off to field service.
Agent: This would also be an opportunity to other kind of your options. So in this case, it's asking if you want to go and schedule a energy audit with a field technician.
Agent: Say, OK, let's keep on going down this flow for a moment. Again, this has the data on what households are available. We can say the type of appointment that you might want to go and have.
Agent: And I'll just kind of keep that for [DATE-1]. And then this is integrated in with field service. So it's actually going to be alive looking for any appointments that might be available.
Agent: Doesn't look like any slots where you found we can extend the dates if you want. But imagine that [PERSON-18] decides at this point says, me what, I'm just going to go and phone into the call center.
Agent: Maybe she uses the chat that's available here, digital engagement, kind of you're on the right. So having that omni-channel kind of experience. So we'll just say that she saves it for another date.
Agent: So now let's go and put on the [PRODUCT-2] hat. Imagine I'm [PERSON-15], the call center agent. So switch over to [PRODUCT-2]. And now this is the same org.
Agent: We have a full view into everything that [PERSON-15] has been doing. So this customer, [PERSON-18]'s story that's on the left-hand side, would actually go and pick up the [PERSON-28] that was abandoned.
Agent: I can go and see all of the [PERSON-18] usage data, billing data, etc. from the customer.
Agent: Some of this, Some of this is just kind of mocked up at this point because it's a demo, but this is where we need to go and embed the [PRODUCT-2] analytics or tablo dashboards, typically connect into those external data sources.
Agent: Before I get into some of the relationship, because model, etc., maybe we'll look at the omniscript. itself.
Agent: So that same experience that we're looking at previously is available within [PRODUCT-2], and we can actually even pick up your paused flow.
Agent: So in this case, I was looking at the paused [NORP-3], and as the agent, I picked it up, and I can go back into previous steps, for example, and it actually saves the context of that customer, right?
Agent: So I can go and go backwards exactly what [PERSON-18] was doing as part of that. which I think is kind of quite cool as he got up .
Agent: It looks like I've updated that since resuming, but it kind of gives you an idea of that can be a seamless experience so the agents don't have to go and ask all the same questions that have already been input online.
Agent: To look through some of the kind of Customer280 that we're showing in a little bit more detail, we've been talking a lot about that, the data model.
Agent: So if we want to go and see this even as a relationship graph, it will go and give you kind of an idea of what this might look like for the end agent, right?
Agent: So we can see that [PERSON-18] is the owner of a business, right?
Agent: She has a kind of a household with her family within it. We can see all the different locations that are associated with her account, the connections to the service points and the meters, so on and so forth.
Agent: Any kind of questions on this?
Agent: Quick question.
EndUser: Cpq, what's the variable data grade into this?
EndUser: Cpq?
Agent: Yeah, so it's a good question.
Agent: So I guess there's two ways you can approach it, right?
Agent: So there is the [ORG-34] that is part of the industry's solution, right?
Agent: So that will be, obviously, would integrate. It's kind of part of the same overall package. And then you'd have the typical Salesforce CPQ that's coming from [GPE-2].
Agent: Given that this is still sales force in the same way that is any other org, you can go and integrate this with the existing CPU that you have.
Agent: Solutions so it's going to be out either or and I think there needs to be some evaluation on that the pros and cons of that.
EndUser: Yeah, because I'm just
Agent: Thinking of like what the
EndUser: How difficult it would be to
Agent: I guess massage it.
EndUser: This to allow for roomy services to be part of Yeah, right.
Agent: Yeah, and I mean that part of it. You definitely can go and do and it's kind of part of the solution is like the understanding that, you know, utilities are opening up new business models.
Agent: So that kind of cross-sell, up-sell experience.
Agent: Do you want to have a smart thermostat?
Agent: You have your home services, kind of your falls within that bucket as well. So you would be able to go and use this with rooming.
Agent: But I mean, there we need to be quite a bit of evaluation and kind of be a deeper dive to like, truly. look at the pros and cons of that and what it would look like.
Agent: This is just the teaser, to be honest, not any full evaluation.
EndUser: Yeah, that makes sense. Plus, I'm curious how this would look after an org that's been around for as long as we have, and is as
EndUser: Co-dependence on everything else
Agent: As we are. So the other piece, and I would need to go and check with someone like [ORG-34].
Agent: Last time I checked [DATE-15], typically you would only have like one business that would be using an org for [ORG-35], right?
Agent: So if you have like two completely separate businesses that use different [ORG-35] teams, you'd usually want to go and have two separate orgs for that scenario.
Agent: And so it would be interesting to explore if that's changed and what the implications are for you.
EndUser: I don't know where we're sitting with that. I know that we're still on the very early stages of a multi-org conversation. Just because there's so much going on and that's not something that would happen in [DATE-18].
Agent: Right?
Agent: That would be a
EndUser: Multi-year project that has to happen. and significant investment on our part, but actually and also timelines in order to get that completed.
EndUser: So I don't think, I think it's a non-starter conversation right now, just due to estimated costs and It would be interesting to see, and I do like this devil.
Agent: Timeline. Yeah.
EndUser: It reminds me why I really liked velocity in the first place.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, and like I generally agree with your comments around like multi-year kind of your strategy, you know, require kind of a lot of rework.
Agent: I just think looking at what you have coming up across some of these business units, trying to look around the quarantine, is there a scenario where that becomes necessitated, right?
Agent: And you know, what will be the triggers for that and do you kind of approach that, kind of your project by project or you know, kind of tie it to some of these major transformations like, you know, what utilities are kind of going.
Agent: Going through with electric being on the start of a four two [DATE-28] CX transformation project .
Agent: Right?
Agent: If you do the analysis and you look at that, just try to go around and run around with what you might need. Meals can stop the demo there. I think there were a few more slides
Speaker 7: Who want to go into. I also just wanted to bring up the fact.
Speaker 7: Obviously, [PERSON-3], you mentioned you're not as plugged in with the electrical right now, but based on our understanding, there's an RFP out with some vendors who won't have the self-horse norible experience.
Speaker 7: To really start a guy even down the path, with respect to technology applied to that roadmap. And really, we want to bring energy in either the cloud and the forest.
Speaker 7: Front here to educate the digital group so that as that progresses you guys are capabl e of asking some of the questions needed as part of that RFP pursuit and have sort of the [PERSON-16] l knowledge of what energy you need to do this cloud could potentially offer as you know thos e responses come in and you guys make a determination on who you're going to work with etc We want to just want to make sure that we're partnering with you on here so you understan d what's what's possible within energy and utilities and how it can be applicable .
Speaker 7: Absolutely.
EndUser: Makes sense
Agent: To me. Just from a technical standpoint, we're looking at some of the reasons why you might want to go and do this. A lot of it comes down to both time to market and building something that is future-proof.
Agent: Those out of the box capabilities improve time to market.
Agent: It can be a lower cost, but there's also the aspect of what's the amount of technical rework that might be needed in the future, the errors that you can go and you know never have happened if you do build with that right, you know, foundation.
Agent: So I think that technical coming out debt argument is quite strong in that case. The other thing I want to go and bring up is alignment with.
Agent: What's where [ORG-5] is going, right?
Agent: So this is a all over industry clouds get updated as three times a year as part of our regular releases.
Agent: So this just kind of paints a picture of some of what we've released over the past number of releases going back. [DATE-16].
Agent: I don't have all the details on this, but it's a sneak peek of some of the things that we're going to be announcing at [ORG-28] [DATE-28].
Agent: So please don't share this out, but you'll see some of the enhancements. But big picture is really going to be around [PRODUCT-9] capabilities.
Agent: So if I think about how much of the kind of call center is focused on just routine things like billing requests and moves, et cetera, if you have the right data, you're the best.
Agent: Available and connected into [PRODUCT-2] This could be the most transformational thin g that is ever happened .
Agent: At all, right?
Agent: You plug that data into [ORG-46] in the right way. You can actually go and have agents that, like the, your self-service, you know, could bought experiences that can handle any number of things.
Agent: And we're building this not only into all of our products, but we're verticalizing this.
Agent: So, you know, if you're thinking about, could be a long term for the business and what could be transformational, I think AI is going to be something that comes up for them and will have to have a strategy about because you're going to start to see other utilities that are going through massive transformations and that will be a pressure.
Agent: My personal view is that like aligning to what we're doing with the industry clouds puts you at the forefront of that for your industry. So I think that's kind of a big one.
Agent: And just to give you a quick idea of what this is, this might actually look like.
Agent: Imagine a conversation that you're having with an agent, have you over chat, see the [PERSON-28] replies that are kind of on the right. These are generated via [ORG-28].
Agent: So this is actually integrated with [FAC-4] in this case, but we have support for [ORG-28]. traffic, [ORG-5] models and other models in the future.
Agent: But all of the data that you have exposed to [PRODUCT-2], including data from [ORG-46], which could be things like even billing information, could be a meter read information.
Agent: I can imagine what I would call a house 280 for roomy where you have all the details around who the customer is, what's the size of their home, the age, what updates they've done over the past, any survey that you sent.
Agent: Pull that all into [ORG-28] and you could imagine just the different scenarios that you can go and look at from like this self-service perspective from a Marketing perspective.
Agent: So I know that this is well out of scope, but I do want to go and like drive home that this is coming and it's coming quite quickly.
Agent: So I think aligning to much of that roadmap is something to consider.
EndUser: I have a question for the pretty. for lack of a better job for the my account that you showed.
EndUser: Right at the beginning of the demo, right?
EndUser: Um, licensing for that.
EndUser: Would that continue to be under community class, community cloud plus?
EndUser: Is the [ORG-49] plus licensing?
EndUser: Or is it separate licensing that you would have to get?
Agent: Yeah, we don't have it like a specifically for, uh, like the industry clouds here, but my understanding is typically what you do is, um, can be, uh, upgrade your existing licenses to those E&U cloud licenses and the community side of it.
Agent: I'm not sure if that gets kind of rolled in.
Speaker 7: So I can comment on that. I mean there's community cloud for energy and utilities specifically.
Speaker 7: So in fact it would be like pretend [PERSON-3] that you guys said this is the best thing since sliced bread and we want to completely move on or completely over at [ORG-46] 7: Does he think about the community cloud being a component of that?
Speaker 7: You would effectively change your community cloud plus licenses to energy and you're committing a cloud for energy and utility licenses. It's the same licensing model that you would expect, logins, members, etc.
Speaker 7: With the inclusion of course of their being an Unlimited community, which is always something that people with large groups of end users who are signing in who don't want to be dealing with [DATE-9] audits and [DATE-30] audits can also explore.
EndUser: Just to confirm there [PERSON-30], it would be, we would still pay the same licensing, it's just called something different. Like we pay up their cents a log in or something right now.
Speaker 7: Well, it is from a pricing perspective. It's a there's an upgrade cost to it, but the model as far as logins and members and then [ORG-34] skew is identical.
EndUser: There's an upgrade.
EndUser: So you're saying it's [MONEY-1] a login?
Speaker 7: I think that's the price that you guys have at [ORG-15]. So you guys don't have a price for energy utilities cloud. So it would be something we'd have to look at.
EndUser: Ok. 46
EndUser: That's the one thing I will give feedback from a customer.
Agent: Maybe this is something I'm not sure if you have any comments on this.
Agent: But I'd imagine this with the renewal conversations are coming up, exploring the different licensing models for experienced cloud, what that might look like could be part of that.
Agent: Absolutely, absolutely. We don't want licensing to be a deciding factor in anything that Code does. And that would be the same for energy in utilities cloud as well.
Agent: Yeah. So please can't give us any idea. Separately from this, feel free to go and look up something called [ORG-44].
Agent: There'll be a lot more about this at [ORG-28] and I can go and send across some information as well.
Agent: But it's kind of a configuration based using all of the fields that you have at your disposal from [PRODUCT-2] as well as from [LOC-2].
Agent: You can actually go and build the prompts that you'd want to go and send to those language models. and then decide how you want to go and use that.
Agent: So in this case, we're looking at [PERSON-28] replies, but exactly the same thing can go and apply to emails that you might want to go and send out via [PRODUCT-10] or within [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: So I think knowing those capabilities would be helpful as you think about the different ways in which you can go and apply this technology.
Agent: So you can think about a prompt that you might put into, you know, open [PRODUCT-9] and design yourself.
Agent: But imagine that you can securely send in a customer data at runtime in a way that won't be fed into that model that respects their privacy.
Agent: And think about how you might want to send that in emails, SMSs, on-site replies, etc. So I'll just kind of put the bug in your ear on that one. So we managed to go and get through the content.
Agent: I'm very surprised. So this is probably. created a few questions along with answering others. So we don't expect this to be the end of the conversation, but we're happy to go and get more into that roadmap.
Agent: If you like, I think doing that additional analysis around how this might impact various areas of [ORG-15] and doing that technical analysis is something that we're happy to go and help with.
Agent: And then in the scenario where you feel that any of this is valid to the business, we can go and demonstrate to the business at any time and do a job with that where we handle much more than the simple transfer of service that you saw [DATE-1].
Speaker 7: Yeah, it just is a call on.
Speaker 7: I know I'd explain it [DATE-28] now since I spoke to [PERSON-28], but I know she had expressed a little bit of interest in learning more about the energy and utility cloud stuff.
Speaker 7: And I haven't made any commitments as far as any demonstrations or anything like that. So I'd walk up your partnership and input on that.
Agent: Are you talking about any final words?
Speaker 7: So I guess if we talk to you, like based on what you guys have seen, you know, [PERSON-3], [PERSON-28], [PERSON-28], and [PERSON-28], I mean, does it make sense for us to <inaudible> deeper into this?
Speaker 7: This obviously, we're just sort of scratching the surface here. There's a lot of consideration here. This is a long-term strategy that you could be looking to put together here.
Speaker 7: So, I mean, when you look at this, is it worth taking some steps here?
EndUser: I... Well, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you go ahead, [PERSON-35].
EndUser: [PERSON-28]. No, no,
EndUser: Well, here's what I would say. I think a lot of this looks really good.
EndUser: And honestly, if we rewind time, it went back [DATE-28] to before we had our utilities org, and electric and gas wanted to start using [ORG-5].
EndUser: If we had known about energy and utilities cloud, seeing all the functions, seeing what we just saw [DATE-1], We would probably might have decided at that point, let's stand up electric and gas on energy and utilities and see how they do and then build things out for them, introduce service cloud, introduce episodes, do CB here, introduce billing, and then see how they do and then see how they like it and then if they really love it, if it's really working for them, roll it out to the rest of the world.
EndUser: The org maybe, but unfortunately we're kind of like if we're looking at rolling out in [PERSON-4] now, I would say that there would have to be a lot of rework done like to move, you know, the businesses off of, you know, what we have custom built for them and that's going to be like a really, really massive project, which I'm not sure there's enough appetite for at this point.
Speaker 7: And I don't think we're advocating [PERSON-35] to make any moves in a short term.
EndUser: I think you
Speaker 7: Embrace really good points here as far as there being a lot of considerations. There is rework that needs to be done.
Speaker 7: I think what we're proposing here is spending time together to identify a couple areas where there would be the biggest impact.
Speaker 7: If the juices were to squeeze, then we can start looking at a longer-term roadmap to make that ship gradually as opposed to an insular big bang approach. But I think all of your concerns are very, very valid.
Speaker 7: And it's something we'd want to partner on with you at a pace that is appropriate.
Agent: The other, I mean, same thing, but I would also recommend, I guess, getting plugged in with [ORG-9] and their own roadmap, because they do have a roadmap of things that they would like to go and deliver over [DATE-28].
Agent: So I think taking a swag, that's, okay, well, what time savings would we have?
Agent: And taking a look at what you get out of E and [PRODUCT-5], you know, over that [DATE-28] journey versus the Yeah, exactly.
EndUser: So I think definitely like this is more of the next step where we kind of, you know, we'll probably have to, you know, do a bit of analysis of our social ground.
EndUser: What would have to be reworked if we were to do this just for, you know, electric and then figure out, you know, what what benefits they would get if they were to, you know, proceed using, you know, for, with their, roadmaps.
Agent: So, um, Yeah, I think like the worst case scenario would be say getting into like [DATE-35] of a [DATE-28] project where you're delivering all these capabilities in [ORG-5] and getting to that point saying, shoot, we've realized that we need to actually go and refactor much of what we've already done because these requirements that are showing up in [DATE-34] five.
Agent: You know, in that scenario, It's better to go and take some of that refactoring pain early on to get the right foundation versus go and kick that count down the road and then eventually have to deal with it anyways.
EndUser: But you could
Agent: Find that maybe that scenario doesn't exist or the amount of refactoring would be less using what you have now versus E and [PRODUCT-5].
Agent: And the honest answer is we don't know at this point because we haven't done the analysis but we're here to help as you step through that.
EndUser: Yeah, for sure. I mean, You know, I totally agree with the assessments.
Agent: I totally agree.
EndUser: But yeah, I think we would have to probably look at what what would need to be refracted and, you know, how much you know, what benefits, you know, benefits versus like the cost, right?
EndUser: Ideally, like, if we were starting out new, like if this was if electric was, you know, didn't use salesforce for [DATE-1] and they didn't have anything on salesforce [DATE-1] and they were looking at all less use salesforce, then, you know, we probably would have said, you know, let's introduce you to energy and utilities cloud, but, Unfortunately, that's not the case.
EndUser: That's not how things play about.
Speaker 7: I know [PERSON-28] has been traveling to make a comment.
EndUser: Yeah, I was just going to say, I kind of backing up to just we had any feedback really. I actually am excited about this. I see there's lots of opportunity, not just for electric, but also the retail business.
EndUser: I think.
EndUser: You know, [PERSON-3] was asking about does it connect with [ORG-34] and whatnot, right?
EndUser: Like can we use it for [PERSON-34]?
EndUser: One of the things we are looking at over there is sort of revamping their whole my account experience for both energy, yeah, for energy and the [PERSON-34] customer.
EndUser: So seeing what you folks had there actually looked quite nice and if there's an opportunity we can leverage it there as well, I think would be good.
Speaker 7: Maybe that's like a bite-sized step we can take is if we focus in on that and say, you know, if it's my account that's really having, that may have the biggest impact here, under say that's more on the beside.
Speaker 7: Then maybe that's sort of our starting point.
Speaker 7: This is a means of exploring that and saying, well, what does it mean to revamp that on your current stack versus what it would mean in E and U?
Speaker 7: And what would the work be required,
EndUser: Etc. Yeah, definitely.
Agent: The other side of it is, it's a shame that [PERSON-3] had to drop, but as you're looking at thateventualorg strategy, in the scenario that you decide that it makes sense to spin out any of the business units into their own org, that might be the point where you start with that in you clouds the template, right?
Agent: So why I think we were talking about this for electric, aside from that previous mention to them, was we were thinking that, like, [PERSON-34] is much more mature, right?
Agent: In [ORG-46], they're doing a lot more in sales force. So technically there'd be more refactoring there. But on, I guess the other side of it is, there's more applicability.
Agent: And there's a scenario where they might get spun out into their own org anyways. Maybe that's actually the same point and kind of,
Agent: Technical debt that's been accumulated or some of those issues where you make changes for one business units and it's impacting others.
EndUser: Yeah, for sure. No, I think it'd be good to talk about it. Like I say, we're looking at my account thing [DATE-30]. And we've got other thoughts or different options.
EndUser: So we should definitely make sure we know what this one offers.
EndUser: What does it look like to implement and whatnot?
EndUser: Because I think Awesome.
Agent: You're such pretty good.
EndUser: And
Speaker 7: I know we're over time here, guys.
Speaker 7: What's what?
Speaker 7: What's the best way of moving that ball forward by [PERSON-28] should he spends time to talk to?
Speaker 7: Like the work loops that we get together to do that or?
EndUser: Yeah, I think it would be good to bring... We've got a few other folks in our team that work quite closely with the retail group.
EndUser: And it might be nice to do a similar sort of demo focused on that My Account piece and the functionality.
EndUser: It'd be great if from your side if you could do a quick assessment of what's the [ORG-55] look like.
EndUser: Like that would be like ideally we would have a single My Account where energy customers and roomy customers would log into. And if you're both a roomy and energy customer, you can kind of toggle between the two.
EndUser: And if you're just energy or just roomy, again, you're just going in that same My Account and see information. I'd love to understand like what's the Marketing capabilities i n there.
EndUser: So if I want to let's see you're a roomy customer only and you're goin g into your account, can I display something like hey sign up for [GPE-9] y [DATE-1] or you know what I mean?
EndUser: Like to try and drop that across promotion .
Agent: I think the other part that may factor into this is that the architecture for commerce right now, and what that looks like, and I know that... Building that out in a headless fashion has some challenges with CPU specifically.
Agent: So if you're using a different CPU, how does that change?
Agent: And the genesis of this CPU is accurate, it was built for the telcos first before it was built for a utility. So it's the same solution for both sides.
Agent: But the reason that it was built was for very high scale use cases.
Agent: So imagine it's an iPhone 8 right?
EndUser: Goes on sale,
Agent: And the mass of scale is going to take down a community. But the way that they'll be able to work with the system.
Agent: On these scripts are built, they could actually be embedded into any kind of your web technolog y and they scale differently outside of [ORG-5]'s core infrastructure .
EndUser: That's probably the trick that would sell me on it, because right now our super-pew is slow. So you can sell me something that's much quicker, that would be a huge one.
Agent: Okay, that's really good to know. And I think this is where I'll start to go and get a little bit over my skis in terms of the technical specifics on that that's [ORG-34] and doing some of that analysis.
Agent: So I'll be sure to go and loop in, you know, could go [PERSON-5] as a specialist in [PERSON-4] within Professional services or others for those specific questions.
Agent: But in terms of like big picture of what's available, how we'll do all these things together in your options. I have a pretty strong handle
EndUser: On that.
Speaker 7: Go ahead. Thank you. I know we're already [TIME-3] over. Folks, I'm on vacation for [DATE-35]. But when I return, we can kind of make the ball and that's moving forward here.
Speaker 7: Maybe we aim for beginning to [DATE-34] to get those folks together. [PERSON-28], [DATE-34], I think you have to know doing a similar session, doing a little bit of this session on the [ORG-49] thing.
Speaker 7: We can aim to do that sort of like early in the [DATE-34].
Speaker 7: Did that matter?
EndUser: It's fine for me. Yeah.
Agent: I wonder if we can even get some of the right people when we have the roomy on site on the sixth.
Speaker 7: Oh, that's actually a good call out. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I can get our folks around for sure.
Agent: Yeah, like I'm not sure how much we can go and prepare for that point, but it just in terms of like having a touch point being able to go through and like further the conversation.
Agent: You know, it's always nice in person.
Agent: All right, see [PERSON-30] has taken a lot of notes. I'm assuming we're good there. We can wrap it up and appreciate the extra time, especially.
Speaker 7: Thank you very much, guys. We appreciate it.
EndUser: Have [DATE-28].
Speaker 7: All right.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive but cautious. They expressed interest in the capabilities of the seller's product and saw potential benefits for their electric and retail businesses. However, they also acknowledged the need for further analysis and assessment of the rework and refactoring that would be required to implement the seller's product in their current setup. They agreed to explore the options and have follow-up discussions to move the ball forward.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer expressed concern about the potential technical debt and refactoring that would be required to implement the seller's product, especially considering their existing custom-built solutions for various business units.
2. The customer was unsure about the appetite within the organization for a large-scale project to implement the seller's product for the electric and gas business unit.
3. The customer wanted to understand the benefits and costs associated with refactoring and implementing the seller's product compared to their current setup.
4. The customer was interested in exploring the possibility of using the seller's product for their retail business, specifically for revamping their My Account experience.
5. The customer wanted to know more about the integration capabilities of the seller's product, particularly with their existing systems like [ORG-34].

Overall, the customer was cautiously optimistic about the seller's product but needed more information and analysis to make an informed decision.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have done a better job introducing the agenda and setting clear expectations for the conversation. This would have helped the customer understand the purpose of the call and what they could expect to learn.
2. The sales rep could have done a better job explaining how the seller's product is different from other solutions on the market. While they mentioned some unique features, such as the data model and industry-specific capabilities, they could have provided more concrete examples of how these features would benefit the customer.
3. The sales rep could have done a better job addressing the customer's concerns about the cost and complexity of implementing the seller's product. While they acknowledged the customer's concerns, they did not provide enough information about how the benefits of the product would outweigh the costs.
4. The sales rep could have done a better job explaining how the seller's product would fit into the customer's existing technology stack. While they mentioned some potential integration points, they could have provided more detail about how the product would work with the customer's existing systems and processes.
5. The sales rep could have done a better job summarizing the key takeaways from the call and outlining next steps. While they did touch on this towards the end of the call, they could have provided more structure and clarity around what would happen next.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So, kind of getting into the data model, maybe before I get into that, [PERSON-5], maybe if you want to just come up mute and introduce yourselves, kind of great timing.""
   After this question, the customer seemed more engaged as they recognized the value of having an experienced person in the call.

2. ""So, as we look at that, it's actually quite interesting to compare that to what we've seen from [ORG-8] and the work that we can view E and Y. So this slide here was taken directly from that evaluation. Maybe helpful to go and just situate ourselves in kind of how the utilities seems to be looking at this.""
   This question sparked the customer's interest as they started to see the relevance of the discussion in the context of their own industry and competitors.

3. ""So, imagine that you have an end customer, [PERSON-18], she's moving homes and you'd like to go and automate as much of that process as possible. And [PERSON-18] is also looking at any other services that might be provided. So this might be more close to the retail energy side.""
   This question engaged the customer as they could relate to the real-life use case and see the potential benefits for their own business.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""So, I think getting into the data model, maybe before I get into that, [PERSON-5], maybe if you want to just come up mute and introduce yourselves, kind of great timing.""
2. ""So, kind of getting into the data model, maybe before I get into that, [PERSON-5], maybe if you want to just come up mute and introduce yourselves, kind of great timing.""
3. ""So, I think getting into the data model, maybe before I get into that, [PERSON-5], maybe if you want to just come up mute and introduce yourselves, kind of great timing.""
4. ""So, I think getting into the data model, maybe before I get into that, [PERSON-5], maybe if you want to just come up mute and introduce yourselves, kind of great timing.""
5. ""So, I think getting into the data model, maybe before I get into that, [PERSON-5], maybe if you want to just come up mute and introduce yourselves, kind of great timing.""

These questions were asked to understand the customer's needs and requirements, and to build a relationship with them. By asking open-ended questions, the sales rep was able to gather more information about the customer's business and identify potential opportunities for the seller's product.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the capabilities of the seller's product, particularly for the electric and retail businesses. They saw potential in using the product to revamp the my account experience for both energy and retail customers, making it easier for them to toggle between the two if they are both energy and retail customers, or just see information if they are only one or the other. The customer was also interested in the marketing capabilities of the product, such as being able to display promotions to customers based on their account type.

Additionally, the customer mentioned that the product's architecture for commerce, and the potential for it to be built in a headless fashion, could be a solution to their current issues with a slow super-pew.

Overall, the customer saw the potential for the seller's product to have a significant impact on their electric and retail businesses, particularly in terms of improving the customer experience and making it easier for customers to manage their accounts.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs in the following areas:

1. Current org structure and design decisions: The sales rep could have asked more questions about the current org structure and design decisions, especially since the utilities org was split from the main app cohort. This would help in understanding the implications of implementing the energy and utilities cloud in their current setup.

2. Technical constraints: The sales rep could have delved deeper into the technical constraints faced by the customer, such as the inability to turn off person accounts due to storage size concerns. This would help in tailoring the solution to better fit the customer's needs.

3. Business units and my account experience: The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the specific needs of each business unit, particularly in the context of the my account experience. This would help in providing a more customized solution for each unit.

4. Marketing capabilities: The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's marketing strategies and needs, especially in the context of the my account experience. This would help in ensuring that the solution provides the necessary marketing capabilities.

5. Commerce architecture: The sales rep could have explored the customer's current commerce architecture and its challenges, particularly in terms of scalability. This would help in positioning the energy and utilities cloud as a solution to these challenges.

By understanding these needs better, the sales rep could have tailored the demonstration and discussion to address the customer's specific concerns and requirements, thereby increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly state that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did express interest in the product's capabilities and saw potential for its application in their business, particularly in the retail business and the revamping of the 'My Account' experience. They also acknowledged the benefits it could provide for the electric business. However, they also expressed concerns about the amount of rework that would be required to implement the product in their current setup and the potential challenges in integrating it with their existing systems."
video_19761_167_6qr3y000000ofy0AAA,"Agent: This of how you would be able to interact with the system, what your perspective would be, anyone else who needs that kind of executive level perspective as well, while also showing kind of at a more ground level what that intake capability is, how we can kind of optimize and make it smoother for your team, And that all starts with this homepage, creating something that is a natural place for your team to kind of get their feet off the ground whenever they get into the office in the morning.
Agent: So this is a tool that we've configured somewhat. So I've brought in a specific kind of dashboard, looking at particular types of matters that are coming in.
Agent: Maybe I want to get a little bit of that perspective to kind of give me some kind of juice as I'm going through the kind of the huge number of calls that the Outreach that we will do with your position.
Agent: Potential clients . but we'll also be able to pretty quickly start diving into the actual meat of [DATE-1].
Agent: We'll be able to do things like dive directly into the intake pipeline and handle the various steps as it passes between the four or five different teams that really need to manage the back and forth with your clients.
Agent: Now, before I actually get jumped into the actual perspective of someone on the intake side, I wanted to kind of take a kind of a further step back.
Agent: Once we are populating [ORG-1], we can get something that starts to look a little bit like this.
Agent: So this is an example of a dashboard that's trying to look at things like leaderboards, other sorts of perspectives within our system. This is built on our incredibly modular reporting and dashboard and platform.
Agent: When I say that, I mean that every single one of these components can be completely ripped out, replaced with something that you want. You can also go and modify the data, slice and dice it however you want.
Agent: Just fundamentally, this is your data. You will be able to modify it and look at it in a way that helps you better understand what's going on.
Agent: When I was watching the Recording of the engagement, that [ORG-2] had with the team [DATE-2]. It sounded like one of the biggest kind of limits with Law Roller is just this sort of capability.
Agent: As you're diving in, it's really a struggle to make any sort of change, to do any sort of investigation into the effectiveness of your team.
Agent: I just wanted to take a second to pause here, admitting that while this is a pretty generic dashboard, I want some help from you in refining this in a little bit.
Agent: What else should we be looking at?
Agent: What would be helpful for you all to see and understand in the management of your team's technology use?
Speaker 4: That's a very broad request slash question.
Speaker 4: When I'm looking at these nice colorful graphs and charts, one of the things that comes to me is how much of this sort of set in place, like
Speaker 4: How much of it is pure customization versus, you know, like preset graphics or preset. I don't know if I'm explaining this right. So we tend to think of a lot of our processes as super unique to us.
Speaker 4: So I'm just curious, like if we wanted to track something that's in the database, I've been assuming that [ORG-1] should be able to, Custom display that but I didn't want to ask that directly
Agent: To you if that's true number one.
Agent: Yeah So I think the best way to kind of explain this is to talk about where you start when you get your sales force work starts with nothing There are no prebuilt dashboards in [ORG-1].
Agent: Everything tends to have to come from somewhere. Now, we've got dashboard packs like this, where you can kind of come and we've kind of built some investigations into kind of common data points.
Agent: It might help you dive in, for example, to look at kind of revenue by [DATE-3] or how your sales team is performing in any given area.
Agent: But underlying each one of these reports is a set of completely configurable kind of investigations in the data that you then get to completely control, delete, create new ones. etc.
Agent: So let me show you what that looks like . in this real example.
Agent: So under the hood of this sales pipeline or this pipeline or kind of, let me see, I've got this activities by rep report looking at how often people are doing certain types of motions.
Agent: This is something that you get to [PERCENT-1] dictate and build into your sales force work. What this is going to look at is it's going to look at certain data tables in our database. It'll look at activities.
Agent: It'll allow you to then break those activities down by any grouping that you set up. So in this particular case, it's going to look at activities and users. And it's grouping by full name and then type.
Agent: So is this a call?
Agent: Is this an in-person meeting?
Agent: Or is this a prep event?
Agent: That's useful, but maybe I want to group this a different way. Maybe I want to take this out. Maybe I want to add in another column.
Agent: This is a system that allows you to fully go in and make those changes and investigate the data in whatever way you want. So maybe I want to look at you know, how often people are doing this.
Agent: So are we doing this on certain dates?
Agent: Right, so here, okay, it looks like [PERSON-1] was really good on [DATE-4], but it's been kind of a drop off recently. We haven't seen anything from them in [DATE-5].
Agent: So I can make those sorts of filters and changes. I can come in here and say, hey, I don't wanna look at all time. Let's look at how we're doing in [DATE-6].
Agent: These are some minor examples of how you can really come in here. and tweak this information. And you can see here that I've tweaked it so that all the data disappears, but let me kind of revert that.
Agent: Fundamentally, this is gonna be your tool, your platform to dive in however you want.
Agent: Does that give you a better sense of me along with it?
Speaker 4: Just wanna get your perspective here.
Speaker 4: I think the answer I'm getting is that things are gonna be super customizable, and that pretty much, Any data that gets tracked in our [PRODUCT-1] that would transfer to a new [ORG-1]-based [PRODUCT-1] can be custom made into some tracking, some graphic to be able to see it.
Speaker 4: Is that?
Speaker 4: It's an over-broad statement, but is that fair?
Speaker 4: Is that how customizable this stuff is?
Agent: That is exactly right. So any data that makes it 9 to [ORG-1], we can build out these sorts of reports and dashboards. That is fundamentally any data.
Agent: It's one of the reasons why we're at our position in the market. is because we're both a hub for all sorts of information.
Agent: We really care about being able to connect to financial systems, getting things like order and invoice information. And you can cross reference that with anything else in here, report off of it, set automation off of it.
Agent: So our ability to be both a home for all sorts of different types of data, and then to report off of it, I think that's a core part of what makes salesforce different.
Agent: There may be some of the other tools that you've been able to look at so far.
Speaker 4: Got it. A related question. Of course. Well, [ORG-1]
Speaker 4: May have more may create that capability for us to do many different things, anything and everything kind of an approach. I'm curious as to
Speaker 4: It that might be a significant cost to us and I will part of it.
Speaker 4: I want to understand, you know, are we in a territory where everything is essentially custom work, custom billable hours?
Speaker 4: Maybe this is a question about, you know, how uh, [ORG-1] is priced and how these custom report things that may need to be billed over time.
Speaker 4: Uh, what sort of included in a plan?
Speaker 4: I have no idea how pricing just generally works for me to sort of think. Yes, the system allows us to build anything we want.
Speaker 4: But are we going to make this offer cost us a fortune because we're going to be so demanding in terms of how customizable we want it to be for us?
Agent: Is that I think it is.
Speaker 4: A fair question?
Agent: I'm going to make sure that the rest of my team gets a chance to answer this, but I want to take first crack at it. because there's obviously an implication that there's the other side of this coin.
Agent: You have all this configurability, but you have to then go and do that work. [ORG-1] has done a lot in order to really reduce that lift on your end.
Agent: I've kind of shown this before, but there's these kind of dashboard packs. This is a free example. We provide a lot of these.
Agent: There's this concept called [ORG-3], where we go and we build specific configurations, some of which are tuned to specific industry use cases, and then we make them freely available to anyone who can install them into their [ORG-1] org.
Agent: So this is one element of that. Another element is our free learning platform called [FAC-1]. This is how I learned about [ORG-1].
Agent: It is fundamentally a tool for end users, admins, executives, anyone who needs to interact with our platform. This will give you guided learning that can take you through and skill you up on [ORG-1] overall.
Agent: From a approachability standpoint, we've tried to make this a little bit easier.
Agent: We've tried to give you some things out of the box that will get you started closer to the point where you You don't have to do as much refinement . But this is definitely an overall risk.
Agent: And we should also talk about [ORG-1] pricing more broadly. So I'll kind of kick it back to the rest of the team if they kind of want to pick up the conversation here.
Agent: Yeah, thanks, [PERSON-2]. I think directly to that question, [PERSON-3], is we see customers typically approach it in two ways. The first, you can think about your initial Implementation and configuration.
Agent: And then the second is ongoing maintenance changes tweaks as the business continues to scale, grow, evolve, how you operate. So the initial implementation, we had [PERSON-4] from [WORK_OF_ART-1] on the last call. He's unfortunately out for [DATE-7].
Agent: And but we'll update him you know as to how the downhill went if that's the partner who decided to go with . But we work with third party certified [ORG-4] partners.
Agent: So they're doing that initial build with you. They're going through a discovery and scoping process and then.
Agent: And [ORG-5] would let you know, hey, this is what it would cost to get this implemented with us and here's the amount of time that it takes.
Agent: And then you say, yep, that looks great or no, we want to make [ORG-6] tweaks. And so that initial build is typically done with a certified partner. The biggest reason for that is time to value.
Agent: As [PERSON-2] said, like we've made, tried to make our platform as approachable as possible, that we understand like your business has to run as efficiently and more.
Agent: Efficiently than it does [DATE-8] And so we don't want any disruptio n to current business processe s and that to impact, you know view and driving revenue for the firm So you work with an Implementation partner get it all tested, make sure that, you know they were checking all those boxes on kind o f this Go Live for your tea m and working through change management as well And then on the flip side, the ongoing maintenance I think we talked about that a little bi t on the last call with [PERSON-4] but on building things like reports, dashboards, adding field s, so adding simple different ways you want to tra ck your potential clients, those things should be [GPE-1] to be done in-house by your tea m, kind of that ongoing [PERSON-5] part of where you would use [PERSON-6] ad and use kind of the support offerings that we ha ve to have someone like [PERSON-7] be really comfortabl e, confident to make any repor t. To get context, my whole tea m. of sales reps, they can make reports and dashboar ds.
Agent: They are not technical resources here at [FAC-2]. So it's all clicks, not co de. Think if you can use [PERSON-8], you can build a report in a dashboa rd.
Agent: So that kind of ongoing [GPE-2], like a lot of those thin gs, we expect your team to just be able to do with the cav eat that if you need additional support as [PERSON-9], they have managed service opti ons where they can help [ORG-7] nt, if you have any more sophisticated asks for their te am.
Agent: But yeah, their goal is to trade you up because it doesn't make sense for you to spend m oney to build a rapport or build a dashboard and spend [TIME-1] on t hat.
Agent: And so we can definitely talk about that more as we scope the project and talk how you'd work with an Implementation partner.
Agent: But does that give a little perspective there, like in terms of that?
Speaker 4: I think so.
Speaker 4: I think can you guys hold on just one [ORG-8]?
Speaker 4: I got to talk to [TIME-2].
Agent: Someone literally Hold on a bit. Yeah, no worries.
Agent: [PERSON-10], because your role is in data.
Agent: What are your thoughts here in regards to the dashboards, the reporting, things like that?
Agent: I'd love to get your perspective, [PERSON-13]
Speaker 4: So, this is looking pretty, at least building the dashboards is looking fairly similar to Power BI and some of the other stuff that I've worked with. And it looks fairly intuitive.
Speaker 4: I guess one of the questions that I have, one of the things that I've done is, I think, Taking a step backwards, one of the issues we have with our current [PRODUCT-1] is it can be difficult to even get the data in kind of a clean tabular format in order to do these sorts of manipulations.
Speaker 4: I think I would hope, I mean, I would imagine just based off of this that once everything gets set up, everything's kind of very clean, easy to edit tabular format.
Speaker 4: But my main question is what sort of integrations with other applications have already been built by [ORG-1] because ideally we would be able to integrate whatever data we've got on a dashboard with data from all the other applications that we're using right now and kind of do that within the [ORG-1] dashboard modeling out the connections, seeing what's going on.
Speaker 4: That's been one of the difficulties I've had with [WORK_OF_ART-2].
Agent: Yeah, thank you. When we're thinking about those integration, just want to kind of repeat back the ones that we've heard about and you can let me know if there's any other place that we should focus.
Agent: I've heard about [PERSON-9] for your existing intake forms. We've heard about Outlook, obviously, as your primary email system. There may be other [ORG-9] 315 kind of programs
Speaker 4: You can let us know about. [ORG-10], as far as kind of file storage.
Speaker 4: What are the other systems that you're concerned about kind of integrating?
Speaker 4: It's very central to be another one. Yeah, very central, but I'm pretty sure it's integrated in.
Agent: One that I know I didn't mention before, it's like [ORG-13] Ads or anything marketing related. There's certainly more that we can talk about and you just made DJ salivate a little bit. It's okay. We'll be fine.
Agent: But when it comes to every single one of the integrations or the external points that you've talked about so far, we have a solution for it. So, cognitive forms does have an Integration to sales force.
Agent: One of the thoughts that I had is that we'll probably want to get some kind of advice from folks about the right way to integrate it because there's so many different data points that you're gathering on that.
Agent: It looks like a mile long cognitive form from the recording. So finding the right way to bring that information in. Some of that goes directly into fields other pieces.
Agent: [PERSON-10] can just create that [ORG-13] document and can then attach it to that lead record so you maintain that record separately.
Agent: So finding out exactly how we can refine that best for you is a little bit of an outstanding question. But as far as the other systems outlook, I've just got it right here.
Agent: So when you're communicating with clients, if they email in, so you hear I've got an email from [PERSON-9], we've got a [ORG-1] sidebar that populates.
Agent: It looks at this particular email address and it says, hey, this is a contact.
Agent: I know a lead who's new or someone who have never heard about and it will be able to analyze that and pull up that information once it finishes loading.
Agent: And it also gives you the ability to not just, you know, register that information, but to do it automatically.
Agent: Here you can see that I've kind of kept it in the more manual mode, or I can log the email. But you can just literally flip a switch for any individuals you want to.
Agent: And as they send and receive emails, those get logged directly into [ORG-1] without needing to lift a finger. So it can save a lot in terms of kind of the, the need to retrain people in certain areas.
Agent: You can also just make sure that you're gathering everything so you get a true reckoning when it comes back to filling out these reports in terms of who's doing what kind of quantity of outreach.
Agent: So that's, we've covered [PERSON-10], we've covered Outlook. [ORG-10] has a complete Integration with Salesforce, so you can tie folders or specific files to records about specific accounts.
Agent: So that way, if you want to say, hey, let's look at all of the files relevant to the various people who've been wrongfully terminated by [ORG-9].
Agent: When you can go to the [ORG-9] account, you'd be able to see a list of all those contracts that were signed, all of the other documents you're getting from people.
Agent: [ORG-10], we have an Integration with Google Ads, definitely be an input to our marketing suite And I'm just kind of naming stuff off So I apologize if I'm just rushing ove r some points of complexity But I just want to impress upon yo u that I have full confidence we'll be able to
Speaker 4: Connec t in these various areas .
Speaker 4: Any deeper questions about that?
Speaker 4: Should we loop back around If we, there are some things we'll, I'm sure, maybe do a deeper dive, but clearly, you know, [TIME-3] [DATE-8], there's no way we can address this in diving into too many specifics about each of these areas, but they, some of them do sort of need a lot of, discussion to see how things should be integrated.
Agent: To any of those integrations?
Speaker 4: [ORG-10] is our obviously phone system
Speaker 4: And [QUANTITY-1] of work happens on [ORG-10]. You know, calls coming through, calls being recorded, transcriptions of those calls to be able to track better of the users who are on those calls.
Speaker 4: [ORG-10] and each of these systems have their own way of tracking and reporting for us, would be really nice to
Agent: Spend time in each of those systems and see how they would really integrate with [ORG-1].
Agent: One of our options here is to go and grab some folks from RingCentral kind of fill you in on a little bit more of the detail here. But there are most common telephony provider integrated with [ORG-1].
Agent: And they've spent a lot of time over [DATE-9] to not just have their own separate database, but to make that fully accessible inside of [ORG-1], [ORG-9] is essentially a widget inside of the tool.
Agent: So whenever you look at an email, or sorry, not an email, obviously we're talking about phone numbers.
Agent: So if I come over here to like my hot leads, for example, I would just click on this number and [ORG-9] would call them and I'd have a pop up in the bottom that would give us information on this particular person.
Agent: So it's a matter of configuring those widgets. bring centralized pre built that to save you a lot of time and effort and money and we can have
Speaker 4: Them kind of elaborate to give you a better perspective on it. Got it. So, sort of going to the basics of sort of where we're coming from.
Speaker 4: We treat law, we treat law ruler as sort of our single source of truth or where things sort of start.
Speaker 4: The truth of it is before things come to Law Ruler, there's a ton of marketing that happens so that leads can come into Law Ruler.
Speaker 4: And Law Ruler has a very nice way of integrating with these outside marketing efforts so that when there's a tracking number being called, you know, they help us generate.
Speaker 4: Tracking numbers on the fly where we can assign it to a specific campaign. So if somebody calls that number, [ORG-9] knows it's from this marketing source And it automatically the information comes into the software.
Speaker 4: So everything Comes into [ORG-9] and then we keep a ton of stuff consistently inside [ORG-9] and then we also have processes that live outside of [ORG-9] But magic world that we want to create, they shouldn't live outside of it.
Agent: In the
Speaker 4: And that's one of the biggest needs that we have is to, we have a bunch of unconnected systems, or manually connected systems to each other, that we want to marry them eventually and deal with one.
Speaker 4: Database, a word such a self-force that can bring all of these things together.
Speaker 4: So at the very least, not at the very least, but as sort of the first order of business is to be able to say, let's accomplish everything Law Ruler is giving us [DATE-8], but have an eye toward, kind of the next stage which is connecting some of these other pieces together.
Speaker 4: So, really the features of Law Ruler that apart from many other CRMs that we've sort of shocked for throughout [DATE-9] is, you know, ability to text message the people.
Agent: Set it
Speaker 4: I mean, when they respond to us, whether as a text message or as a, picture message for us to be able to get those things efficiently.
Speaker 4: You know, communicating my text is paramount for a lot of businesses, [PERCENT-1] for us. A vast majority of efficient communications happen over text.
Speaker 4: Appointment scheduling, a lot of rulers integrated with a program called Appoint Let, which is an outside program that has integrated where we use, like it's similar to calendarly.
Speaker 4: I'm sure you're familiar with all these companies that do that, where it allows automatic scheduling, not a lot of manual human involvement is in the mix, but for these leads to, for our teams to know, okay, this person is scheduled for an appointment, and there's tools about sending them reminders, [TIME-4] before, their appointment [TIME-5] before their appointment.
Speaker 4: So text Messaging is huge capability of all ruler appointment scheduling is a really important one.
Speaker 4: Campaigns, automated campaigns that go out to the leads is super, super important for us and these things are controlled by statuses and law ruler. So if they're in a particular status, we trigger certain custom.
Speaker 4: Campaigns to them that includes text message campaigns, email campaigns, for example, we've had an intake call with them, they're supposed to send us documents, we want to send them periodic reminders automatically without having to pick up the phone call, you know, phone to give them a call to remind them to send a certain documentation.
Speaker 4: That's just one of many examples. So these... email and text message campaigns are a really important feature of Law Ruler.
Speaker 4: User level controls of who does what and keeping history of these things is really important.
Speaker 4: What else I'm missing from [WORK_OF_ART-3] that they do for us that we rely on sort of day in and day out. Obviously taking notes for each lead as different activities happen.
Speaker 4: That might be like the top five things that we do in [GPE-3] or that we want to at the very least
Agent: You know transfer to a new system before we think about on expanding and doing more things with it.
Agent: You've given us a lot to think about. Luckily, we've heard a lot of this from being able to speak to your team already.
Agent: So what I'll say is the specific aspects that you're talking about in the model rule are being able to kind of set up campaigns, reminders, being able to handle across different channels like email and SMS, being able to then report on all this.
Agent: These are all things that [ORG-1] does very well. As I go through this, I'm showing them a miss specific details. So I just want to say out the gate that we can accomplish everything you've already talked about.
Agent: And my goal here will be to kind of walk you through at least parts of it, starting here on a particular lead.
Agent: So as we get the intake about these clients, as they feed in to various marketing channels, really quick point.
Agent: We'd initially heard that marketing was a phase two, so I don't have as much to showcase in terms of marketing, like campaign development, campaign and journey builders.
Agent: But once we get past that stage, we can go back and we can show that stuff to you later. We end up somewhere like this, where the lead is now in front of members of your intake team.
Agent: They're going to be able to use [ORG-1] to better track, to better understand, and to use it to help set up those automated outreaches, to be able to use it as a platform for scheduling appointments, everything that we're talking about here.
Agent: So what are we looking at on this page, and then we'll kind of dive into those deeper aspects. On this page, we're looking at a lead.
Agent: The basic details that we've been able to gather from whatever kind of marketing input, from whatever kind of data load that we're doing, it all ends up here.
Agent: And we're able to also see things like, well, what marketing channels, what kind of engagements have we already hit this customer with?
Agent: So it looks like some regional field marketing, we may have shook hands with this customer. They kind of dropped by our website at one point.
Agent: We can kind of see some of this detail on the lead as we kind of process them and go through the various steps. .
Agent: And thinking about various steps, we understand that there's a very kind of back and forth process that currently happens as leads are taken in to that round. And there's that initial intake.
Agent: There's kind of the case management side of things. There's the document collection. All of that can be built into specific stages that set off specific automation in [ORG-1].
Agent: So I'll admit here that I've got a pretty truncated kind of four-step process. This would be a lot more complex for the use case that you guys have.
Agent: It would allow us to pass the lead to the appropriate team. So if I promote it to qualified, Well, okay, now let's pass it. We'll notify, we'll send a notification to the Document Collection team.
Agent: We might even have an automated flow in the background to immediately send an email to the client.
Agent: We can do a lot to, as we progress through this process, to automate the next step, to make it a little bit easier for your team to collaborate around the vast volume of leads that you currently have in your system.
Agent: So there's a lot that can happen just here on this lead view. We already talked a little bit about integrations.
Agent: So, hey, while we're talking about the document team, you know, our connection with [ORG-10] can mean that we can see the files. I can have like a file section here below marketing.
Agent: We'll be able to look at that when we get to the account page. We're able to kind of connect in that [PERSON-10] form that can help us fill in the appropriate details.
Agent: And I might even have kind of, you know, the file directly from [PERSON-10] can be uploaded right here. So I can reference back to it.
Agent: These are the sorts of things that [ORG-1] gets you when we're talking about kind of connecting in some of these integrations. I'll admit that I've been talking a fair bit here.
Agent: Any kind of initial questions about kind of [DATE-10] of your question about kind of managing part of this intake.
Agent: Any thoughts here?
Agent: And not really. Okay. Please don't worry. Interrupt if you need to if you have a question or any thoughts. So that's, that's part of this process. Then there's the. Okay, how do we communicate with these folks. So.
Agent: At the most basic level with no [ORG-18] add on sales force, Consent list emails. So I can grab a whole bunch of people. I've just selected these guys. Maybe they were in this list.
Agent: That I filtered to hot leads, but I can change it to whatever I want. But if they're in this list, if I select them, I can then go and I can send like a list email.
Agent: It'll parse their fields appropriately. I can go on leverage an existing template. So maybe I want to grab one that's great for kind of doing a call follow up for leads.
Agent: Maybe I spoke to these guys [TIME-6] and I can just send that. Right. I'm going to save this as a. actually I'm gonna <inaudible> out of this for right now. So that's one part of this process.
Agent: But one of the things that we can kind of go into is building out a little bit more of a complex process. What we heard from [ORG-2] is, look, there's a lot of contacts out there.
Agent: A lot of folks will try to get in touch with and they won't be able to reply back to us.
Agent: This is actually a great use case for [ORG-1] because we can set up more advanced nurturing campaigns that can really do a lot too. give you better intelligence about when people might potentially re-engage.
Agent: It can give you a lot more branching capability in terms of, well, okay, they opened the email but they didn't click anything. Well, let's send them, let's call them.
Agent: Let's try to get a hold of them since they're somewhat engaged a little bit right now. That sort of branching capability is kind of core to the way that [ORG-1] thinks you and your team should engage.
Agent: It should be more responsive to the signals that the customers are sending. then in terms of mechanics, yes, we can also include SMS, [ORG-18].
Agent: So I've already kind of been practicing a little bit of SMS back and forth with one of our clients, but I've got my phone here.
Agent: I can automatically send a, start a conversation so I can go here and I can say, hey, I can automatically reach out to a client through that marketing tool or I can just select this person.
Agent: I can say start a conversation. And I can say, hey, [PERSON-9]. And that shows up on my phone. That's the most recent conversation. I hope you guys can see that. So we can kind of go back and forth.
Agent: And then, of course, there's the kind of the mass texting, the campaign automation around texting as well.
Agent: So there's a ton of capability in terms of being able to kind of hit people in all channels, centralize all of this, analyze all of it through a dashboards, connecting it through to our various Integration points to make it a little bit easier for you to manage all of this.
Agent: I'm just going on and on. I'll take another second here to pause.
Speaker 4: Any thoughts about kind of that kind of mass email in SMS kind of outreach?
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Agent: The
Speaker 4: Only comment about this is there's a lot of individualized back and forth. Yes.
Speaker 4: There's also status based automations as somebody remains in a status that may indicate they still owe us something for us to every so many days to fall, keep following up, keep sending them, hey reminder you still need to send [GPE-4] documents.
Agent: Where so long
Speaker 4: And to do that on a pre-scheduled, we say essentially, you know, every day within [TIME-7], you know, within the limits of what the semester rules may be, I think, [TIME-8] some, based on generalized guidelines like that, follow up every, you know, so many days until that status changes.
Speaker 4: So, very, a lot of status-based
Agent: Campaigns is how things happen in a lot of work.
Agent: Understood. That is how [ORG-1] functions as well.
Agent: So I haven't been able to show you any of the marketing campaign, the ability to say, send this, wait [DATE-13], send this next thing, but that's a core part of what we deliver as well.
Speaker 4: So one of the things I wanted to mention in [PERSON-9] and Ruler is that we haven't been able to generate reports on is there's again there's so many data points that happen that we keep track of but yet we're not able to run nice reports about and I'll just throw in some examples you know How long does it take from one person to go from this stage of the process to this stage of the process?
Speaker 4: So that we can look at that as a report and say, well, guys, this is taking us forever.
Speaker 4: We need to cut things short and then hopefully we can reevaluate in [DATE-9], you know, are all the changes we're doing make sense.
Speaker 4: That's just one of many things that we would like to keep track to see, to make us more efficient.
Speaker 4: Another one is tying all the marketing efforts that we've been spending, putting a dollar amount to those and say, how many of those are we converting into clients or how many or what does it cost us to convert into a client?
Speaker 4: I mean, one of the biggest metrics any business is interested in their client acquisition costs, right?
Speaker 4: All of these things you know, are kept track of one way or another for us, but we are not able so far to nicely create reports where we can have those things at our fingertips.
Agent: So luckily [ORG-1] does provide a lot of capability in this kind of historical tracking arena, right?
Agent: So you specifically mentioned like how long has someone been in a given stage, right?
Agent: So, Look, we've been waiting for them to pay that invoice for a really long time, but specifically how long we have that capability to be able to show you.
Agent: So I don't have it live in this or just because my demo data is not perfect, but I was able to find this [PRODUCT-2] video from a compatriot of mine.
Agent: You can see here that we're looking at something called stage history.
Agent: This is fundamentally the concept of saying, hey, when did something change?
Agent: What were the specific changes that were made to a given lead or a given deal or a matter in this case?
Agent: Beyond that, you can also dive into where was this point?
Agent: Kind of a reporting system for it. So you can then do filtering.
Agent: So I want to look at certain sets of history, like show me all of the customers who have been in waiting for invoice for [DATE-10], right?
Agent: Put that on my dashboard. Those are the people I'm going to call [DATE-8] to try to get this stuff checked off. [ORG-1] has that capability kind of built into how we handle reporting off of those various
Speaker 4: Stages that your clients might be in.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I mean, invoicing can be definitely a similar category like that is when you change somebody's stage. Presumably the database keeps state [QUANTITY-1] of that.
Speaker 4: And we should be able to see how long it took us or how long has the person And like an sort of aging report, if you will.
Agent: Been in that stage.
Speaker 4: That's just one of many different. things that would be nice for us to know about on a regular basis.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: [PERSON-3] and just from a kind of leadership perspective, obviously [ORG-1] as a software company is a very different business model than how you operate, but aging on opportunities is one of the critical things that I look at as a manager for my team.
Agent: So Hey, [PERSON-18], why has this opportunity been in stage three for [DATE-9]?
Agent: Is this real?
Agent: What can we do to progress this?
Agent: And then [ORG-1] starts not only to have automation.
Agent: But it's a smart system So you're start gonna start leveraging be able to leverage AI Okay, here's how we can progress this to the next stage like as reminders for your team Just to simplify the process have them focus on the highest value targets but also reminders for them of what key critical thing s need to be collected or what needs to happen on their en d to help progress
Speaker 4: The stage or not focus on it any longer .
Speaker 4: One topic I want to cover [DATE-8] is You know, I think this sort of topic I'm about to tell you is sort of what got us to rethink.
Speaker 4: I sort of come back to this conversation about, okay, we need a better system, we need a better system. And it came down to. How we.
Speaker 4: Keep track of companies. I don't know if you guys know this already. We're an employment employee rights law firm. We protect the rights of employees essentially.
Speaker 4: And we, our customers are employees, just like all of us, right?
Speaker 4: So the way we keep track of these people is we associate them with their employers and We do a lot of research when someone reaches out to us about a company.
Speaker 4: We do research to find out more information about the company.
Speaker 4: How big it is, what kind of revenue it might generate, how many employees it might have, what kind of lawsuits it may have gone through in the last five [DATE-9], what the status of these lawsuits may be, so on and so forth.
Speaker 4: So this research task that we do about each company is done in a fairly manual way.
Speaker 4: We have company X, we go spend the time to do some research, we copy paste the information onto a [PRODUCT-3] document, we save it into [ORG-10] by company name, next time somebody else reaches out to us from the same company, we sort of go to [ORG-10], look up that information, See who did what on that company last time.
Speaker 4: Does it need any updates?
Speaker 4: Pull up that information again. We thought that we need a better system of keeping track of that information.
Speaker 4: Or if we've done certain research about a company, As soon as another employee contacts us from the same company, we'd like that information to be at our fingertips.
Speaker 4: Through as long as obviously we've maintained that information in a related database, we want to be able, thanks to talk to each other, you know, in [ORG-1], in our next system that can get that to us on MoMAK's notice.
Agent: Is that a fair description or is it a clear description of what I'm describing?
Agent: Yes, and the [PERSON-18] Prep just on this. We've had some time to think about exactly how many different ways [ORG-1] can really kind of open up this kind of this nest of problems for you.
Agent: So first and foremost, companies in our system, we tend to call them accounts. You can rename them to whatever you want with every aspect of [ORG-1]. And I'm looking here at [ORG-9].
Agent: We've got a list of the related context. People who we know work at [ORG-9] who have been reaching out to us. These are the folks who have come in through our intake form.
Agent: And I've just kind of grouped them all here. They're on the [ORG-9] account page. So really easy for us to look at this page and see who those folks are.
Agent: I can also flip over to another tab to see what legal matters we brought before them. Here again, it's demo data, so it's not perfect.
Agent: But it's a list are, maybe even the list of what the invoices with those clients are.
Speaker 4: Of what our engagements
Agent: We can see this existing history that we've already engaged in around this account from just this one perspective.
Agent: There's a number of other ways we can do this too, but just this immediately kind of... change the way that you think about this?
Agent: Is this a good way of kind of representing what all of these
Speaker 4: These various clients are kind of in their connection to to a particular company?
Speaker 4: You these related contacts are essentially
Agent: Other leads that have something in common with the lead of hand.
Agent: Is that fair?
Agent: Yes, so just to be like fully expansive here, there's a number of ways to think about this.
Agent: Contacts can be just simply people work for this company, but it can also be a person who has some other sort of relationship to this company. So you can go and you can add other sorts of connections.
Agent: Maybe someone works for another firm that they were fired from [ORG-9] and you want to represent that a certain way.
Agent: I can come in here and I can add [PERSON-9] and I can say, okay, I can set up whatever specific technical role that you want to. Maybe she's related in a certain way. Maybe she was fired.
Agent: And you can. build custom roles, add them in here, maybe even multiple, to be able to say that this is the case.
Agent: So hey, she started there, you know, [DATE-9], or [DATE-18], and she was fired on the first, right?
Speaker 4: She can have this kind of, this net so you can understand exactly what happened when to be able to reference this and go back to it.
Speaker 4: So the way I envisioned that would work for us is to have company profiles where the company profile identifies the basic information such as employer name, maybe address information, maybe any contacts there at the company, and then it would have certain fields that would have researched information.
Speaker 4: Source where it came from,
Speaker 4: All the metrics I've mentioned to you, company size, lawsuits, and more even more specifics about their lawsuits, what their status is.
Speaker 4: And then next time when [PERSON-18] calls us, we mark in [ORG-1] that person works for [ORG-18] It has that easily accessible because it ties to that employer's profile. I get the related contact language.
Speaker 4: Law Ruler has a way of doing it. We learned recently. I don't really like it the way they're doing it, but essentially creating is maintaining a database of company profiles so that we
Agent: Can associate people to those company profiles so that the connection can be much easier.
Agent: Yeah, so I think [PERSON-2]'s going to show a little bit about a role up here, but to answer the first question, [PERSON-3], around keeping details on the account. So say, you know, for this example, you're working with [ORG-1].
Agent: Or you have clients that are not happy with their experience at [ORG-1]. So you wanna understand [ORG-1] as a business first and foremost. So on the account page, there was a section that says details.
Agent: Again, you can customize this, name it whatever you like, but this is how we do things at [ORG-1] just to give an example. On the details could be things like the revenue that [ORG-1] brings in [DATE-18].
Agent: They're a member of employees, their website, their address, key, just data points about [ORG-1]. [ORG-1] as a business So you can have all of that informatio n as you're doing your research the first go around .
Agent: You have that as more of like a company profile.
Agent: And taking a step further, if you did want to integrate with any other, you know, third party sources that take a look at companies and distill information about companies, you can do that as well to get like third party information as you're doing your research about the company of [ORG-1].
Agent: But you can have that kind of company profile there. And so that you can go ahead and update. We have this thought process around accounts, which is one other way to think about it, that you can have more.
Agent: Multiple types of accounts So one type of account could be those companies It would be [ORG-1], [ORG-9] And then you can have another type of account which is a person account So that is the actual potential clien t who you're representing And then those roll up to each other So you can see which clients are rolling up into [ORG-9] e or, and then also in the next level like pay me to be of a client who's jumpin g to multiple different companies And there are submitting claims at multiple different companie s. Maybe you want to flag that in your system t oo as part of your intake process as maybe .. someone to kind of keep a watch fly about.
Agent: So [PERSON-2] has this kind of roll up how we think about how we, one other way to just think about accounts, but absolutely you could have a company profile and have specific information and fields
Speaker 4: That are relevant to that initial research that you do. So you're not having to maintain that in a third party. Okay.
Speaker 4: So the way accounts is set up in [ORG-1] is that account can be a lease, just like what we're keeping track of for our lease, and then an account type can be for a company, and then you can essentially link,
Agent: You can make them associate with each other.
Agent: So that, am I understanding that correctly?
Agent: That's right. So there's a lot of complexities. We're really getting into the kind of the weeds here of exactly how you'd configure this.
Agent: What I'll say is as we think about more kind of ways that we can specifically build this out for your team.
Agent: This is one of those places where a certified Implementation partner can save you a lot of time with some best practices.
Agent: So those are the kinds of folks that will recommend to talk to at some point in the cycle. We want to make sure that you can not just get sales force
Agent: The way that you want it, but get it done quickly. And so that's one of the kinds of things that I'm sure that we're going to kind of follow up with here.
Agent: If I can jump in really quickly just to make sure we are respectful of everyone's time, we're almost past a [TIME-9] mark.
Speaker 4: Does anyone by chance have a hard stop at one or are we okay to [TIME-10] past one?
Agent: Maybe continue this for an extra
Agent: I think [TIME-13] should be fine. Perfect.
Speaker 4: Perfect. Just want to make sure and just want to be respectful of everyone's time.
Speaker 4: Let's see there. So the way I mentioned this during the last call were
Speaker 4: I feel a lot of anxiety, right?
Speaker 4: I used maybe a different word last time, but anxiety sounds like maybe a better term this time about how complex our systems are now. And how.
Speaker 4: Concerned I am in general to think about how do we even start kind of in a pro-tried to get us on a better track to have a better system in place.
Speaker 4: Just because we're a large organization, close to 110 employees, and there's so many different aspects to our business and so many different ways. We've built ourselves to work.
Speaker 4: Law ruler addresses, everything we've been talking about addresses, maybe majority of our business. But there's other kind of groups that do other things, but a lot of ways they're all interconnected.
Speaker 4: But they're not connected automatically in this, you know, this time. So. One of the ways that. You know, if I was given a clean slate to redesign everything we're doing, the might approach to something like this is.
Speaker 4: For us.
Speaker 4: To spend quality time to draw out how we do things and how we want things to be done on a new clean slate, which I would imagine that a [ORG-1] engineer or Implementation guy, whoever the right person is, is the first thing they should be asking us, All right, what do you want me to build?
Speaker 4: Right, it probably wouldn't add you or she would not ask us that same exact way, but where do we start?
Speaker 4: We don't want to create some visual even for us to say, okay, here's the way we're doing now. But we clearly are not entirely happy with the way we're doing things now.
Speaker 4: And what are some of the things we need to make adjustments to?
Speaker 4: So, drive out, physically drive out, you know, create flow charts, organizational charts to, for us to be on the same page, you know, where we're heading and for us to communicate that to you and say, this is what version of one of our system architecture looks like.
Speaker 4: And then for you to look at that, ask many questions, so on and so forth. That's sort of where I would think we start. But you tell me as to how
Agent: You approach these situations.
Agent: Like where do you start with organizations like this?
Agent: Who want to make a switch?
Agent: Yeah, no, I mean, it's a great question. We approach it typically as a crawl walk run approach here at [ORG-1].
Agent: We find that's the most successful way to see value in the platform and have minimal disruption to what's happening with your business [DATE-8]. Well, having an eye on what the future looks like of the firm as well.
Agent: And so I think potentially what's maybe happened with some of the systems is, you know, you're working with a law ruler and it got you up until a certain point.
Agent: But you're not it's not as scalable of a platform, meaning you can't configure it in the way that you want to unwinding it.
Agent: It's going to take maybe a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of resources.
Agent: And so why customers go to sales come to sales force is that we, you know, we work in the kind of small and immediate business.
Agent: Space, but we have Enterprise level customers on [ORG-1] as well that started in th e small to medium business space and grew and scaled, scaled their team and their business And so kind of why I mention that is [ORG-1] is absolutely a scalable platform and tha t doesn't mean you have to go through re-implementations of everything that you've done in the past Our goal in phase one is to have your business I mean, this is typically that the goal of phase one is your business is offering at as high of a level as it is [DATE-8] with the processes that you have while taking away some of the biggest pain points around Integration around data around what you and you'll call single source of truth, but doesn't sound like it's really single source of truth in law ruler [DATE-8] because not everything is integrated and [PERSON-9] So taking away like the biggest pain points that you have, and then continuing to iterate on i t. I don't think that it's common nor recommended to like, re look at the entire way that your business operates and change that process and flow, because you've been very successful up until this point.
Agent: So it's, I think probably more little tweaks and getting data integrated or getting platforms like integrated together than, redoing the way that you operate as a business, which again, you've been very successful. You've grown till this point.
Agent: And so how we typically do that is a partner. I know, you know, we'll come in and scope the project.
Agent: So they're really understanding like, what is the current state and what are the biggest challenges with the current state and what are some of your biggest goals?
Agent: Like, where do you want to get to in [DATE-9], [DATE-18], [DATE-9]?
Agent: Like, what does that kind of plan for the business look like?
Agent: And so as they're building, they're not customizing. you into a corner where you can't change or kind of scale easily with sales force .
Agent: That's, I would say, we don't typically like re-imagine the way that you're doing business unless there are huge gaping holes in the process
Speaker 4: That you need to change immediately.
Speaker 4: Okay.
Agent: I mean,
Speaker 4: I didn't mean to suggest we would redesign our business. We clearly have a functioning business.
Agent: But
Speaker 4: If somebody tells me, tell us. how you guys work. As seemingly that.
Agent: And deceptively simple question like
Speaker 4: There's so many moving pieces. I would want to visualize like, you know, I don't know why I'm not showing on TV, but. It's like. Like.
Speaker 4: I want to make sure we put them in that because one of the reasons we want to do all this is to make some improvements as well.
Speaker 4: If we continue like this, you know, business will be as usual, you know, just all the nice things that we've been thinking [DATE-23] that we should be making, we would essentially not do.
Speaker 4: So and we're growing organizations. So we want to put the organization on the right path.
Speaker 4: To be because we create a lot of data and we're just not doing justice to ourselves to let that data just sit there with nothing happening to it so we want to put the systems on make intelligent decisions based on [DATE-30], you know, based on all that data.
Agent: A path to keep
Speaker 4: So again, my vision is. Just when okay, you know, paint a good picture for me.
Agent: Before your person tells me,
Speaker 4: If I can visualize that for ourselves and use that opportunity to maybe make a few tweaks and say, okay, on a clean slate, we've been thinking about, let's make sure we incorporate that as well.
Agent: All these few nice things that
Speaker 4: It's a perfect opportunity to do it because if I'm gonna just replicate exactly how I
Agent: Was doing it before then. . This is not a
Speaker 4: Great path to be on. Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: That's how I visualize next steps being in this journey with you. Yes. No, I actually think [PERSON-23] were completely aligned on that. I probably phrased it in a way that made you think maybe we weren't.
Agent: So absolutely the last thing that we want. Yeah. Okay. You. Yeah, we want. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Good. We just- Good. Yeah. Thank you. One more.
Agent: Is for you to buy [ORG-1], which has all these capabilities and I think things that are going to solve a lot of the challenges you have [DATE-8].
Agent: And then you rebuild it exactly as Law Ruler operates and you're still faced with the same challenges that you have [DATE-8]. So we don't want that. We want it.
Agent: What we want is to take all the things that are working really well. and get that implemented within [ORG-1] and then eliminate the biggest challenges that you have [DATE-8].
Agent: And that can be things around data integration, but it can also be things around the process.
Agent: And maybe here is best practices or here is how we would recommend getting it set up with the system that's a little bit more flexible.
Agent: So how typical scoping on Implementation works is first you do like I would say maybe [TIME-9] scoping with a partner where they're just.
Agent: Making sure they understand the goals for the project, the different users that are involved kind of what their day to day looks like.
Agent: And you're getting more of a high level SOW where they com e back and say, here's the time it takes and here's the cost to implement.
Agent: And then you're getting t o a point where you feel comfortable that this vision is going to be accomplished.
Agent: The first two two [ORG-23] [DATE-30], it's a, on average [DATE-25] though, of the actual Implementation is deep discovery an d wanna keep track and navigate around are protecting the system where they' re going to have a user story for every individual who 's using [ORG-1], what their day-to-day lo ok like, how they operat e. What are the good things about that?
Agent: What are the challenges?
Agent: What do you want to maintain?
Agent: What do you want to change?
Agent: Everyone's going to have a user story and everyone will be completely represented. They'll know your business very intimately through that process before they ever build a single thing in [ORG-1].
Agent: That's kind of a typical structure again, but whatever you need and whatever you need to be able to make a decision, we want to facilitate that for you and be your partner throughout the project. [PERSON-18] doesn't go away.
Agent: I don't go away. DJ [PERSON-2], like you still have this whole team of resources once you're on the [ORG-1] platform. And so it's really in everyone's best interest that it's a successful project of course for your team.
Agent: But I think what we would love to understand is like, what do you all need for a, like a best next step?
Agent: What's going to be the most beneficial thing?
Agent: Is it?
Agent: Talking to a partner to learn a little bit more about the Implementation side.
Agent: Is it seeing anything else in a demo environment that maybe you didn't see [DATE-8]?
Agent: Want to double click into and kind of validate on the technical side.
Agent: Like, what do you feel like is the most beneficial next step?
Agent: And then we want to align to that.
Speaker 4: I wanted to understand sort of at what stage, you know, does your maybe discovery call happen where you guys really learn the specifics. of what we need to accomplish.
Speaker 4: At what point do we get committed to [ORG-1] where we are comfortable enough to say, okay, we're going to do this and I want to make sure what then we know what the next steps feel that the most justice we can do to ourselves, to you in this for us to know.
Agent: Are. I just
Agent: Relationship, is two
Speaker 4: Um, give me [TIME-10]. Oh, that's really good.
Speaker 4: Um, is for you guys to fully understand, uh, what we want to do and that we are comfortable to know that we can accomplish all those things and a bunch of cool things that we haven't been able to do.
Speaker 4: So, like, we, I would think I would want to spend really quality time with someone who really knows that, you know, it gets to know all the details get a good feel that, you know, they can accomplish those things for us.
Agent: From us and then we
Speaker 4: At what stage does that have?
Agent: Yeah, I mean, absolutely. I will say, we have spent a couple of conversations with [PERSON-18] learning the current process of the business.
Agent: So I have, I think, a high level understanding of the different teams, how they operate, when the handoff happens from the first team who's calling to the second team doing document collection, to the third team doing the qualification on documents, to the fourth team.
Agent: I feel like we have a pretty decent understanding of that. However, we're. happy to dive deeper with you and we'd love to do that . And I think.
Agent: Would also be great to meet you in person and to do that if you guys are open to it. So we can actually be face to face in a room.
Agent: If that's something that seems interested in, but I think if that's kind of a session that we want to do that we can get, you know, that sign, we can get that session kind of signed up and we'd love to also bring an Implementation partner to that session because the last thing we want is for you to have to repeat a lot of the conversations.
Agent: We want to make sure that you're feeling comfortable, but from the sales first side, which we're confident that we can execute on the project Just like we have with thousands and thousands of our customers, but also on the Implementation side that you're feeling comfortable there.
Agent: So that's definitely something if you want to dive . you know,
Speaker 4: A lot deeper into. We can talk through that.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, a meeting in person sounds didn't even know that's an option.
Speaker 4: Fantastic. I great to see some of the people face to face who would be ultimately helping us.
Agent: I think it's
Speaker 4: So we can certainly make that happen and have and talk more specifics and that.
Agent: An Implementation guy in the room
Speaker 4: You lay out to us at some point
Speaker 4: Kind of how you see the next steps happening from your point of view.
Speaker 4: We want to get the goal rolling, we want to get more and more comfortable and create steps for us from crawling to walking and all those things that you're saying.
Agent: Meaning like we want to get to the next stage,
Speaker 4: You know, I think it makes a lot of sense for us to, you know, keep going
Agent: To the next step and, and, and get something going. Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: So, and you are you a student [GPE-5]?
Agent: Is that correct?
Agent: Okay. So I live in [GPE-6]. And we're So we're very close.
Speaker 4: All kind of most of us are something called [GPE-7], [GPE-8].
Agent: Hold on just one [ORG-8]. Sorry. I'm trying to give you [TIME-2]. Okay. Yeah.
Agent: I guess I'll ask.
Agent: Folks left, like [ORG-2], is there a lot more detail to the process that we're gonna learn from a session?
Agent: I think it's very valuable for us to
Speaker 4: Come on site regardless that is there any guidance that you would process that we can still cover in the person session?
Agent: Give us as far as technology,
Speaker 4: I think personally, wise, I think we're all set.
Agent: I feel like Integration Okay.
Speaker 4: I know it's possible, it's one of those things where you just
Agent: Have to kind of get down in the weeds and just start like messing with it to kind of, understand how it would be implemented, but I think technology as I think we will sign.
Agent: Okay, so it sounds like we really want to focus on doing a better job of like charting out the actual operational process that will map into [ORG-1]. There's obviously many things that [ORG-1] won't do for you.
Agent: There's existing good process and technology that we're going to integrate with rather than even consider replacing. So I'm excited to kind of figure out exactly how
Speaker 4: We can go and meet. and start to kind of put this
Agent: Pen to paper in terms of kind of making sure the world in the same page about what the technology should be doing. Yeah. Cool.
Speaker 4: Okay. Perfect. So I believe that the team
Agent: Is off [DATE-23].
Agent: And then you're coming back first, you can [DATE-31] is that accurate?
Agent: Middle of the song [DATE-31] is when we come. Okay. [DATE-31]. Great. So.
Agent: Do we want to get something scheduled right now for [DATE-36]?
Agent: Is it best if we
Speaker 4: Send you time?
Speaker 4: Like do you have kind of my idea of what your calendars look like for us to come actually be in person with you and then we'll kind Because [DATE-25], [DATE-26], we're back since [DATE-37] will probably
Agent: Of facilitate the Implementation discussion as well?
Agent: Be a little crazy to get back on track. Yeah, absolutely. On times. So I think we can set something. Okay.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I guess on my end, anything besides the like the eighth, so [DATE-26], the ninth or the 10th, but the ideal, I'm not sure for the rest of my team.
Speaker 4: Can we do it on the [DATE-31], [DATE-33]?
Agent: Yes, we definitely can.
Agent: And then I want to ask as well, [PERSON-23], I know we talked a little bit about kind of marching towards that [DATE-31] time bring given that it sales forces [DATE-31] and the most, you know, the best rates on pricing.
Agent: Is that still something that we want to be kind of talking about again?
Agent: The reason that I'm asking is not to pressure you, but candidly on sales force, like our resources are aligned to [DATE-31] deals.
Agent: So we want to make sure that for making the ask of our team to come, which we definitely want to, that's kind of that's where we're marching
Speaker 4: Towards is that [DATE-31] timeframe.
Speaker 4: Is this still the goal to, you know, keep going and make a decision as soon as possible?
Speaker 4: So we can make it happen, you know, by [DATE-37].
Agent: We should do that. Okay, great. So knowing time is precious.
Agent: Would you be available to me a little earlier in [DATE-37], aside from [DATE-33]?
Speaker 4: We could meet Okay.
Agent: On [DATE-31] maybe.
Speaker 4: We have a bunch of new people who are starting on [DATE-36].
Speaker 4: So [DATE-41] might be a little tough,
Agent: But [DATE-31], I think. Yeah.
Agent: Do we want to do maybe like [TIME-9] and we can bring lunch for the team as well?
Agent: Or is there a certain
Speaker 4: Time on that [DATE-31]?
Speaker 4: I'll end just one second. I just want to make sure there's. Yes. All right, [ORG-30]. So the 10th would not work. We have a. I'm at [ORG-30]. Do [TIME-9]. First, three, two, three.
Agent: The [TIME-9] seems to work best for the team here.
Speaker 4: I'm going to <inaudible>
Agent: The 13th. Let's do the 13th.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: The 13th?
Agent: Ok. And
Speaker 4: What time of day?
Speaker 4: Ok. Can we do it at [DATE-35]?
Speaker 4: So I started to
Agent: Say [TIME-18]. And then.
Agent: For how long should we schedule it?
Agent: I would say let's leave [TIME-18]
Speaker 4: For the session Okay All right, let's do that [DATE-26]
Agent: To 33
Speaker 4: Great Can you tell us you don't need to tell me now if you don't know but How many people were expecting and what the roles they have so that?
Speaker 4: You know, I might want to bring in a couple of people as well who might want to
Agent: Listen in and contribute to support. Yeah, absolutely. So we have a couple resources who are out right now and then I want to just make sure if they can be valuable to come.
Agent: So we will get you and by say [DATE-23] on [WORK_OF_ART-4], but we'll just shoot you an email of who we envision being in the room, what their role is as well.
Agent: You have plenty of time to plan before the event. to facilitate people on your end. Okay.
Agent: Sounds good. Then in the meantime, just as a calendar placeholder, I'll send a calendar invite right after this meeting.
Speaker 4: Sounds good. We already have two on the calendar. Just say no.
Agent: [PERSON-18] just sent them invites. I just sent them invites. Lock it down.
Speaker 4: Hold the time.

Agent: Thank you so much.
Agent: Happy holidays.
Agent: Happy holidays.

2. ""How much of it is pure customization versus, you know, like preset graphics or preset?"" (when discussing dashboard customization)
3. ""What sort of integrations with other applications have already been built by [ORG-1]?"" (when discussing integration with other systems)

After these questions, the customer provided more detailed responses and showed more engagement in the conversation.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of the seller's product throughout the call.

video_19762_167_6qr3y000000kAcZAAU,"Agent: All right, and then let me share my screen.
Agent: No one that's all coming through for everyone.
Agent: Okay, and we will dive right in. So [DATE-1], as mentioned, we'll be taking a look at Marketing Cloud intelligence.
Agent: Here's our obligatory forward-looking statement to base all decisions on products that are readily available and generally available at this moment.
Agent: Quick introduction, I'll just flow through this because I haven't met a few of you, but I am [PERSON-1]. I am the account executive for all things Marketing Cloud for access that work specifically with just financial services.
Agent: I'm joined here [DATE-1] by [ORG-1]. She is your core account executive, so she handles these sales and service side of the business. My manager was going to be on but he had a conflict.
Agent: So [PERSON-2] is access is dedicated solution engineer. And then we are joined [DATE-1] by [PERSON-3], who is our specialist solution engineer, specifically for Marketing Cloud intelligence. He'll be the person running [DATE-1]'s deep dive demonstration.
Agent: And then I've invited our director of business value, [PERSON-4], to walk through a business case of why [ORG-2] could make sense for access.
Agent: So just to touch on what we'll cover [DATE-1], we'll do a quick what we've heard kind of a summary of what brought us here [DATE-1] and why we're having this conversation. I will.
Agent: Talk lightly about what [ORG-2] is and then we'll kick it over to [PERSON-5] to kind of walk through where we see the business value for access with this tool. Then I'll hand it over to [PERSON-6].
Agent: They'll take us through an introduction of Marketing Cloud intelligence and kind of what we're going to cover in the demo before we hand it off to [PERSON-7].
Agent: So we'll walk us through the deep dive of the product and then we'll circle back and certainly want any of your initial feedback and then talk kind of alignment on next steps timing going forward.
Speaker 6: Does that
Agent: All sound good to everyone?
Agent: I'll take a plan. Alrighty. Um, so what we've heard and I definitely would like some feedback on this. If there's anything else that you think we've missed or anything you want to dive deeper on, please let us know.
Agent: We can obviously make some changes and kind of tailor this demo to your expectations, but what we know so far is that access uses a mix of. eight or more Marketing channels, multiple Marketing platforms.
Agent: And there's really a desire for a single view of performance metrics. So right now across those disparate systems, you know, a lot of times you're getting reporting that can be in different formats.
Agent: Maybe it's running at different times and just having that single view is really key to really being able to do what the second point is here, leverage analytics and insights to take action on your different campaigns to quickly iterate on those campaigns and most importantly to attribute your Marketing efforts to ROI through multi-touch attribution.
Agent: So, when speaking with a lot of other customers and what we've heard from AXOS 2, that data preparation, that harmonization, a lot of that ends up being to some extent a manual effort which is time consuming and reducing those manual efforts is going to be key to really driving the business forward to scale this out and move more quickly.
Agent: There's a need for focus on media mix modeling. We've talked media pacing, planning, obviously the multi-touch attribution and using all of that to fuel that data-driven optimization, reduce waste that's spend, increase, return on ad spend.
Agent: Shareholder alignment is also a big one here.
Agent: Just having that visibility across departments of, prioritizing for different strategies, what's working, what is not, and being able to democratize and share out that real-time data of performance and really tie that back to different benchmarks and KPIs that are tied to your priorities.
Agent: And then having flexibility with reporting and that data visualization aspect. Flexibility is a big thing with Marketing Cloud intelligence. We include a sandbox specifically to allow you to kind of tinker with reporting without going into the live environment.
Agent: So in case one of those one-offs does come up, you're able to go in there and really pull the information you need.
Agent: So those are really the six main buckets that we heard, but I'm curious to get your feedback. There's anything that I might have missed or anything else that you really want to dive deep on [DATE-1].
Speaker 6: As for me, I believe that, believe what, you know, this hits on at least the large majority of our pain points.
Speaker 6: I'm probably not in the weeds as closely as R is on this and [ORG-3] and [PERSON-8] are [DATE-2] new to organization.
Agent: So this is a very good high level for a stab at it. Awesome. Happy to hear it. Thank you, [PERSON-9].
Agent: Okay, so what is Marketing Cloud intelligence again just at a high level before we kick it over to [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-7] to dive deeper.
Agent: Marketing cloud intelligence allows you to utilize analytics and insight so connecting all of your data sources harmonizing all of those data sources and tracking back attribution.
Agent: So it's going to allow you to optimize your Marketing sprint across paid media, other channels, get access to those near real-time dashboards, those reports.
Agent: You can set up your own KPIs, your benchmarks, your goals against that reporting, track that with [DATE-3] updates, quickly iterate, make adjustments to your paid media spend, Utilize our [PRODUCT-1] and our insights to kind of see where maybe the next best place would be to invest.
Agent: What is underperforming?
Agent: What's overperforming?
Agent: Where you can get the maximum out of that dollar.
Agent: So with Marketing Cloud intelligence, the goal here again is just to reduce that wasted ad spend, optimize campaign performance and then gain speed to insights to allow you to reduce cost and free up time to spend on other high value activities.
Agent: And why we think this is important for Axos is something that I'll let my colleague [PERSON-5] touch on right now.
Agent: Perfect, thanks [PERSON-10]. So by way of introduction, I know that [PERSON-10] mentioned I am a value consultant here at [ORG-4].
Agent: So I've been here now for [DATE-4] and specifically get to work with our [ORG-5] and customers on creating what is the value story that we are trying to say as we look at the problems we're trying to solve, which is everything that [PERSON-10] went through in the kind of what we've heard section.
Agent: So there's a handful of numbers I know on this slide here and sometimes that can be a little bit daunting for some people. So I'm going to work to break it down.
Agent: And obviously, any questions, feedback that you'd like to see on this mode l are absolutely welcomed as well .
Agent: So I want to draw your attention to the first area on the left-hand side of the screen where it's an increase in media spend ROI.
Agent: So this is one calculation that we do as we look at what is the value of Marketing Cloud intelligence.
Agent: What does that bring essentially to the bottom line when the CFO comes to us and says, what are you going to do for me?
Agent: This is one way that we can go about calculating that.
Agent: And that is understanding what type, what's the level of media spend that we have in our current budget [DATE-1] that isn't working for us in the way that we want it to work for.
Agent: So my background is actually in digital Marketing prior to being at [ORG-4], I was on the agency side of the fence where I woul d doing way back when manual keyword bids on behalf of our customers.
Agent: So I understand that more than likely this team here and any other types of partners you may be working with on your digital media, you're constantly working on optimizing campaigns to make them perform better for you.
Agent: That said, we all know that it's really challenging as you're going through multiple channels across your media spend to consolidate that data, utilizing pivot tables within manual processes for reporting to truly see a full visualization of what is actually working for us and what isn't properly.
Agent: So we know, based off of what our customers have shared with us, that they find anywhere from [PERCENT-1] of wasted spend that they can see when they have this visibility that [ORG-2] provides in reporting.
Agent: That it's not working for them properly.
Agent: So in this calculation, what I did was I took the [MONEY-1] budget that acts of spends [DATE-1] and said, what if we take that small end and we'd say [PERCENT-2] of that is what we uncover as being, quote, wasted?
Agent: Well, we're not going to say finance, hey, you can just remove that from our budget, right?
Agent: We just want to do more with the budget that we have.
Agent: So if we take then that 2.4 million that we've uncovered and we say, well, we're okay with some of that being, quote, wasted because we're using it for [ORG-6]: Testing, we're using it for brand recognition, you know, so on and so forth. So let's reallocate [PERCENT-3] of that into better performing campaigns with an estimated ROAS of [PERCENT-4]. That would give us [MONEY-2]
Agent: Of benefit from the current spend that you're already putting into the programs just by reallocating at that conservative level. So I'm going to stop.
Agent: I just talked a lot at you and see what types of questions, comments, feedback do
Speaker 6: You have on this particular model that I went through?
Speaker 6: Necessarily any questions. We're going through the exercise of trying to understand where allocations.
Agent: We can reshift
Speaker 6: I haven't quite labeled it as drastically as waste is spent identified. Yeah.
Agent: But you're going down that same path. So I'm sure we can find [PERCENT-5]. Okay, perfect. No, that's good feedback, [PERSON-9].
Agent: And I think, you know, there are times where when I'm partnering directly with a customer on this exact model where it's well. I like the model. I'm good with the model, but let's just change wasted spend to perform.
Speaker 6: Or you know something It's okay, you know, some like It's the reality of the fact is we're trying to identify yes, perfect.
Agent: Like that. the best disinfectant.
Agent: These gaps as we speak. So Let's call a speed of speed. Great. Well, now I'll move to the right hand side here. If they want to make sure that I'm giving [PERSON-6] enough time for him as well.
Agent: But really, this is just again, an overview of what would be. being spent [DATE-1] on those manual report polls.
Agent: I know, you know, I'm mentioning that I was o n the agency side and at one point in time I was working with a customer that had 36 business unit s and each one of them I was pulling .
Agent: [DATE-5] report poll for, and it was taking me [DATE-6], just of my own time, of polling reports for them on a [DATE-7] basis, just for them to have full visibility into what they were trying to accomplish, right?
Agent: To look at the optimizations, to determine if they were using the right channels at the right time, so on and so forth.
Agent: So really what this model is, is saying, okay, well, how many FTEs do we have?
Agent: That are doing this manual report polls, some are internal, some might be external.
Agent: And what happens if we can improve that?
Agent: There's always going to be [TIME-1] spent that's going to be put into reports because you have to do the analysis behind it, right?
Agent: To say, why do the numbers come out the way that they do?
Agent: But if we can pull back on all of the work and excel in the pivot tables and pulling direct out of the platforms and so on and so forth.
Agent: What does that look like How many hours could people actually have back in their da y to focus on other projects to focus on that strategy and so on and so forth So with this model, that's essentially what we're saying her e is we can put in how many [ORG-7] s are doing those manual processes determine how much time roughly are they spending on reporting and then what does that improvement percent look like as well So here we're projecting [TIME-2] given back on an [DATE-8] basi s across the span of 36 employees Obviously, we know that there's probably a little give and take to that number and there 's probably a little give and take to that [PERCENT-2] numbe r. But you can see that at least from this perspective that thousand hours is definitely a [PERSON-11] impact that people can be putting back into the business and other s. effectively.
Speaker 6: So if they're
Agent: Yeah, I just went off mute. Okay. No, just chiming and saying sounds good. Okay, perfect.
Agent: So from here, I'm happy to pass it on to [PERSON-6] to kind of get more into the nitty-gritty of the platform because that's really what
Agent: We all care about the most, right?
Agent: The shiny objects. Thank you, Cairn. Appreciate it. If we can go to there you go. So what I'm going to do is I have three slides to just kind of set up what is the Marketing Cloud intelligence piece.
Agent: It starts out with really an understanding that I think we all have on the phone already, is that data is inside those. But we all understand the goal is to get that to cross platform centralized reporting.
Agent: And that's what we're driving to in the middle, right?
Agent: Is providing that unified view of Marketing performance, give it to you in a real-time insight, and then enable you to use that data to drive decisions within the organization.
Agent: And then on the far right side, we recognize that there are different cohorts of people within your organization that need to see that data at different levels. And that's really the goal for what we're going to show. [DATE-1].
Agent: If you want to go to the next slide please .
Agent: So at the bottom, you can see a bunch of logos. So [DATE-1], this is the space we operate in as marketers. Our data comes from a number of different platforms.
Agent: Some of those platforms are easy to take data out of.
Agent: Some of them are very difficult and take, and that's what consumes our time, is to take that data and convert it into something that is usable within our organization. Sometimes that screenshots from their in-platform tools.
Agent: But what we're offering [DATE-1] is a tool that allows pre-built connectors into each one of these different ad tech vendors. and pull that data in seamlessly automatically and then put it into a campaign model that is pre-built.
Agent: And that really is the goal, right?
Agent: And then be able to take that from different regions across different brands and products. and then make that data appear unified in a centralized repository. And my last slide.
Agent: And then in terms of the functional capabilities, right?
Agent: When we talk about cross-channel Marketing intelligence, that means first and foremost, we have to be able to easily ingest that data. Most of our customers already have some type of business intelligence tool.
Agent: But getting on their radar or getting bandwidth from that team has been challenging. So we pre-built all of those connectors and we pre-built the campaign data model that you can extend in order to ingest that very quickly.
Agent: And then we provided that unified data model. And there's tools that we have to help you harmonize that data into that model and extend it. And then in the middle is the interactive dashboards.
Agent: That is really where people start to see the benefit of this tool is. Now we've taken the data in, we put it into a model, it's unified, and then we can express that or display that through dashboards.
Agent: And those dashboards can include multiple different kinds of widgets, so you pretty much Unlimited way to show that data.
Agent: And then you can also create reports, and you can customize that data however you need, including match mode charts in a new screen. creating your own dimensions, creating your own measures.
Agent: Then we're layering on top of that AI-led insights. We call that [PERSON-12]. And that will look across the data and fair it out anomalies.
Agent: That AI can see and that we can then better use to say, oh, we're getting good performance out of this campaign, let's reproduce it, or we're getting bad performance, let's go fix our Messaging or what we're going to market with.
Agent: Then lastly, is goal tracking and alerts. When things happen within our reporting infrastructure, we're showing attainment towards goal or non-attainment, and we're also able to send out notifications upon events.
Agent: I'll pause there before I turn it over to [PERSON-7].
Agent: Any questions on that?
Speaker 6: Questions at least on my part the only truth that I want to share is I'm not as close to the martech stack. That's why I'm not sure, you know, what certain things are turned on.
Speaker 6: I know we have [PERSON-12] on so I lean a bit on our for helping me help bridge
Agent: The gap in terms of knowing what's on and what's not on with you guys. So, but thank you.
Agent: Okay, with that, I will pass over to [PERSON-7] who's going to take us through a deep dive of the product. Great.
Agent: Thank you [PERSON-6] and thank you all [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-10] for so many different diverse voices on this call. It's great having so many people that can speak to intelligence in such a profound way.
Agent: So I get the fun part of actually jumping into the platform. So I'm going to spend [TIME-3] or so and walking through all those key points that [PERSON-6] just shared.
Agent: So how we can accomplish that within a tool.
Agent: We call Marketing Cloud intelligence as a formulae, we call it data-rauma prior to this, but it's a fully integrated tool into the [ORG-4] ecosystem, the [ORG-8] and aggregate, all of your Marketing data directly, so you can have that real-time performance, tracking and analysis.
Speaker 6: So just wanna pause here.
Speaker 6: Can you guys see my screen clearly enough?
Speaker 7: Just wanna make sure it's big
Agent: Enough and it looks good.
Agent: All right, so let's jump in.
Agent: So I'm going to start on the dashboard inside because that's just the in product, the flashy part where we get the dive into the data, explore insights and places we can actually take action with the data.
Agent: But the tool is set up really with marketers in mind.
Agent: So we built this tool for marketers to be able to be self-service, self-sufficient, be able to explore their own data, not have to always rely on IT and other business data teams and data science teams to provide reports.
Agent: This is going to give you the power to actually do the types of analysis that helps you optimize on those campaigns, driving the kind of performance and add, you know, a return.
Agent: Our ads have been type savings that you can allude it to . So we'll start the visualization side, how you can build dashboards, how you can deploy these, share them out across the organization.
Agent: But then I'm going to spend a little bit of time on the back end.
Agent: So how do we integrate the data?
Agent: We'll jump over to our [PRODUCT-2] and Mix section.
Agent: How do we directly connect to the data via full library maintained APIs?
Agent: But also, how does it all come together that makes sense and power what you're seeing now in this dashboard?
Agent: And then we'll go into our marketplace, talk a little about some of the extensibility of platform, how we can drive both media planning, pacing, and type scenarios, some of the key points that you asked to, you know, dive into for this demo .
Agent: So starting out, you can see in this particular dashboard, we're pulling in data from all over the kind of Marketing ecosystem.
Agent: So we have [ORG-9] ads data, [ORG-10] data, so all of our email and journey data coming in, web analytics data coming in to understand web engagement, but also all these other cross-channel Marketing solutions flowing into the data model to help power the types of insights and learnings we're going to get from this information.
Agent: So that includes personalization and Interaction studio data flowing in. So we can have. all of the data you're currently collecting and actually making good use of it, you're driving value with this data and putting it to action.
Agent: And so once this all comes together, we organize it into, you know, basically an out of the box data model for this type of Marketing data.
Agent: And that allows us to start tracking on a least daily basis exactly what we're spending across all of our Marketing campaigns, which driving deposits or new account creation, new loan applications or credit card applications, any of the kind of Marketing KPIs that you're held accountable to, we can help, you know, tie those campaigns that you're running to those kind of type of Marketing outcomes.
Agent: Everything in this tool is set up for Marketing out. We're not just doing simple metrics We're not just optimizing CPMs [DATE-9] on every campaign We want to see what's actually driving your top KPIs and goals .
Agent: And that could be something like offer acceptance rates or engagement rates on all of our different campaigns or our email specifically or journeys.
Agent: Or it could be just we do want to optimize our cost per lead or acquisition costs across our different channels from social to maybe direct mail even and offline channels all the way through to our emails and kind of website.
Agent: So, All of that ties together so then we can actually set up alerts and goals. So if we're pacing to our goals, we can set up an alert to say, hey, we're doing really well.
Agent: Here's a great dashboard to check out, send that to our executive team, our Marketing team [DATE-10].
Agent: Or if I'm a channel marketer and I care about specific campaigns, maybe if we don't hit our [ORG-11] cost goals or our cost-relied goals for that campaign in [DATE-11], I want to set up an alert so it actually triggers to tell me what's going on.
Agent: But it may actually reach out to the platform and pause that campaign if it, you know, breaks it maybe [PERCENT-6] kind of threshold on that [ORG-11] or that cost-relieved threshol d that we built in So we actually have some actions that can be triggered based on the
Speaker 6: Real-time performanc e data that's flowing in for those outcomes .
Speaker 6: Any questions so far?
Speaker 6: Can you describe pacing and how you know how your system creates that?
Speaker 6: Because for example, one of the things that we're working on within the market digital Marketing team now is and they've gotten there in a census.
Speaker 6: As we measure our performance, let's just say in [DATE-12], rather looking at a snapshot, we want to understand how we're pacing towards the overall full [DATE-13] trend, run rate, you know, I call the run rate.
Agent: So, how are you guys able to, is it just, how do you guys do that in your systems?
Agent: And we need to talk about pacing to go on. Yeah, so when we think about pacing, some of it might be reluding to media pacing.
Agent: So just making sure that you're getting your budget spent and the time that budget to be spent in the right kind of pace.
Speaker 6: Allotted for
Agent: So you're not overspinning up front or you're overspinning towards the tail end of that campaign, actually seeing the budget being spent effectively across channels, but also hitting those KPIs and goals. So I'll touch on it in a moment.
Agent: We have a full app that can help you manage all of that, not only for the planning side of those.
Agent: Those allocations for your budget but how you measure that performance over time And so obviously because we're getting dat a from all of your kind of Marketing channels, at least daily we can start to understand what did we spend where did we spend it on which creatives, which campaigns and which ones are actually driving the performanc e we expect so we can understand ROI and return on ad spen d type of kind of longer tail metrics .
Agent: So I'll show you kind of how we set that up. It's really built into the data model overall and how we aggregate the data. So you can get time-based metrics like even this training performance.
Agent: So if I want to see, instead of [DATE-12], I'm going to see [DATE-3] understanding of exactly how we're actually spending our
Speaker 6: Marketing dollars, but how it's actually driving applications or new accounts or any of the other KPIs that I'm holding these Marketing dollars accountable to.
Speaker 6: Yeah, you know, for me, [DATE-16] of our velocities just as important as [DATE-13]. But as you know, I can
Agent: See as we're approaching the goals, just understanding there's a time alignment to that run rate or pacing that you're talking about. Thank you. Sure, and I'll touch it.
Agent: I'll show you a little bit of preview here, but when I get to our marketplace, we have a full really robust app for media pacing specifically, which basically allows you to quickly identify and see exactly what is spinning on pace or under pace and basically surfaces insights for you to help get things back on track as you.
Speaker 6: Well. Okay, thank
Agent: Sure.
Speaker 7: All right. Let's go down a I'm sorry.
Agent: Bit. Oh, question.
Speaker 7: Just we're going back to that, but that just is tracking the spend itself, not necessarily the conversion funnel and optimics up there. Right.
Agent: Yeah. So some are just specific to this spend and then others on the media planning side are seeing how your spend is actually driving the down kind of string [ORG-12]'s and funnel [ORG-12]'s you'll be
Speaker 7: Tracking. Okay.
Agent: And this is kind of a kind of a decent look into that, which some actual granularity in the data.
Agent: So this complete performance analysis allows me to see at least daily exactly what's going on with all of our campaigns across different dimensions in the model.
Agent: So I want to see my campaigns across our different channels that we're running these campaigns are, exactly what we spend on them, how it's driving our goals, like deposits or ROI, new accounts.
Agent: Acceptance rates cost to lead acquisition costs. All those are possibilities here, but really just being able so I can quickly identify for when optimized towards that best performing by ROI.
Agent: I can stack rank those, see that our social campaign for rate alerts is doing really well. It's driving, let's say. lower acquisition costs or lower cost per lead.
Agent: So I can quickly identify exactly what's happening and then run filters through it as well.
Agent: So if I want to filter my products or landing pages that they're going to from our campaigns, specific campaigns themselves, or if we have regions or different [ORG-13]'s we want to track things by, all that can be set up in the data model during initial setup and implementation, but also allows you to add these as you go to.
Agent: So we want to break things down in more granular fashion and get all the way down to the creative level. I can overlay that data and see exactly what's happening.
Agent: Which creatives are most effective which search keywords may be most effectiv e in driving performance All of that is readily availabl e so I can get into the detail s and then pull the levers for optimizatio n to drive performance .
Agent: And then beyond that, being able to actually surface insight using [PRODUCT-1] machine learning. So we alluded to [PERSON-12] earlier. We have [PERSON-12], which is our [PRODUCT-1] machine learning tool set. specific for this Marketing data.
Agent: So this is going to be running through the Marketing data on a [DATE-3] basis, looking for ways that you can optimize. And so some of these are surfaced here on the dashboard.
Agent: For instance, these region insights on a certain campaign has a much higher conversion rate. We have a specific creative, our [ORG-12] loans over social channel, lower click-through rate.
Agent: So this is when we might want to figure out how to optimize better because we're not getting the clicks we'd expect. specific landing pages doing better or poorly. This is surfacing what's most impactful across your Marketing ecosystem.
Agent: I can go and explore this data, see what I can do to actually change that.
Speaker 8: I'll touch on that in a moment. We'll explore [PERSON-12] a little deeper in a moment, and how we set up these bots, so you can deploy them and get insights really quickly easily.
Speaker 8: And [PERSON-7], is the [ORG-16]
Agent: Data kind of baked into these insights here?
Agent: Or is there a separate section that will kind of talk more through user behavior when they're on the site?
Agent: Short answer is yes. [ORG-16] does play a big part on the engagement side, especially if you're looking at landing page engagement or conversion rates on the site from those campaigns, even keyword analysis.
Agent: And so we're going to use that data to append to all of your other cross-channel data. So if you're looking at a high-level [ORG-12], might be multiple kind of streams, including [ORG-16] to power that.
Agent: Others might be like, might want to set up a bot that's specific to driving conversion rate on site or what personalization and different recipes that we're deploying in personalization are actually better conversion rates or better engagemen t on site as well So all that data does play a role in [ORG-13] is a big piece of that .
Speaker 8: Driving. you know,
Agent: Got it. Thank you. All right.
Agent: So I want to spend much more time on the dashboards because I'm sure you've seen a lot of dashboards in your day, but just kind of showing you how we can pull up actual creatives.
Agent: You can actually see the creative copies directly in the dashboard layer. So you don't have to go to the platforms themselves to see what you're actually running as those ads.
Agent: Other ways to break down the data if I want to see campaign combinations here, understanding what's driving applications or we're spending that money allocated across these different kind of business lines. Also, intelligent actions down here.
Agent: So these can be deployed as well. So I talked about how we can trigger actions based on rules. You can also trigger them just with a button on this dashboard.
Agent: So if I want to send all of our high level KPIs and a dashboard to our executive team, I can run a Workflow action that sends out an email with all of that, you know, as a PDF or as a, you know, table directly to those individuals.
Agent: I can even run actions that pause or boost campaign spend or open specific apps in our marketplace. So really flexible and how you can.
Agent: Can deploy these dashboards that be really user friendl y and tell the data story that you want to tell either at a high level or in the weed s with the granular data that this provides .
Agent: I didn't talk about editing dashboards. It's pretty straightforward, very simple. Everything's drag-in, drop. All these widgets can move them around. I can go in and edit what's available in the data tables here, so I click on a table.
Agent: I can see all my different measurements, my dimensions here. I can add additional ones directly from the model itself, and everything's neatly organized. So I want to see make a livery data.
Agent: I'm going to add an additional metrics here for all of our delivery for our ads. But all of this is directly in the data model. And I'll touch on the data model in a moment.
Agent: But just want to touch on this just so you see how easy it is to edit and adjust how you visualize this data, all the different options as far as visualization, different options we have there in our library.
Agent: So whether it's goals or time comparisons, low charts, funnels, all of that is neatly available here in the library, as well as custom type of widgets as well.
Agent: So if you want to deploy custom resources, do some development yourself. This is all based on rich web technologies.
Agent: You can deploy CSS and [PRODUCT-3] and everything and make this really, rich, really beautiful dashboards because it just relies on the basic web technologies you're already using.
Agent: All right. So now I'm going to pivot over to our connect them exception and talk about how we connect the data together.
Agent: So if I go here, I'm going to be in [ORG-18], and here I'm in [FAC-1]. So this is where I can quickly connect data.
Agent: We have a rich library of pre-built API connectors, about 160 different API connectors for all of the most popular data sources you want to connect to in marketing.
Agent: But if I kind of scroll through here, you can see some of those. So we have basically four web analytics data for all your demand side platforms, for re-add networks.
Agent: Across social networks, both organic social posts, to competitive type intelligence, all of the different connectors that you would need to scale up and add additional data sources.
Agent: So if you wanna try out maybe [ORG-18] [DATE-18] and try to kind of test and learn strategies on different new channels like [ORG-18], for instance, you can deploy that, connect to that data, [ORG-21] ads, trade-desk data, all of that really quickly and available.
Agent: And all you need to do is put in your admin credentials and the data connects automatically.
Agent: Do a secure API, it automatically maps into the data model for you and we know exactly how to work with data from each of these different vendors.
Agent: So it's automatic for you to be actually filed away, neatly organized, normalized in the model. And one thing to point out here is that these are always being updated.
Agent: So we have a team of engineers that are constantly updating the connectivity to these different data sets and tables. So an example of that [ORG-9] is a prime example where they're updating their API every three weeks or so.
Agent: And so that's time where if you built this yourself or having other tools to manage this data, you have to go through and rebuild that API connection.
Agent: Do you QA, do some analysis, make sure that data is working and it's matching up like it used to?
Agent: Where we are maintaining this for you, you don't have to worry about that. It's always going to be.
Agent: Connected, you're not missing out on data there's no historical lapses, all of it's always connected So just something I want to point ou t as far as the value of having a tool like thi s that has a full maintained library of APIs ready to go .
Agent: And then when it comes to other data sets, we have ways to pull in the data, whether it's in a flat file.
Agent: Maybe you work with an agency and they send you a report [DATE-10] and it comes in as an [PRODUCT-4] file. We can automate that ingestion and processing directly into the platform for you as well.
Agent: So it can be emailed directly. It would be set up as a data stream through any type of kind of intermediary data dump.
Agent: If it lands in a data warehouse, we have access to all the different data warehousing tools. That's online and both offline here.
Agent: So really, it's really expensive when it comes to Enterprise level data access and Integration for that into the data model here for marketing.
Agent: And then lastly, what sets us apart is, if I go back to the top here, we have a universal connector here called [PRODUCT-5].
Agent: So if we don't have an API connector for it, you can use our universal connector, which basically allows us to be completely data agnostic.
Agent: We can access data from anywhere, automate the processing, but this tool allows you to set up how it's mapped into the model, control the mappings, the actual data model objects.
Agent: So if you wanna get in and customize how you, you're naming for different objects, all of that, you can do that as an admin here using [PRODUCT-5].
Agent: With all of the different Enterprise level mapping and data model functionality you would expect .
Agent: Any questions on the connectivity on the APIs or the data ingestion process?
Agent: All right, so with these data connectors, we are pulling the data in aggregate. When it comes to running type of use cases like multi-touch attribution or attribution, that requires us pulling the data in at the individual level.
Agent: So we can understand those first party touch points, what emails they interacted with, what journeys, what they clicked through an ad and came back to your site and took some type of conversion action.
Agent: That's going to come in with [ORG-24] data. So all that data that needs to have a more granular data model for that type of setup.
Agent: And so while we're aggregating here with these into our normal data model, we also provide what we call the granular data center for more robust granular aggregation of that data.
Agent: So this, I'm not going to go deep into this. This is just more of a data lay kind of SQL environment that we set up to manage for multi-touch attribution type use cases.
Agent: But it also provides specific connectors, you just click in here, that OR-R4 actually pulling in that granular data at the individual level.
Agent: So for instance, we have our [ORG-4] Marketing Cloud granular connector here, which goes to data tables that are in the back end that are usually not exposed in [ORG-10] that have subscriber ID level individual data so we can get to those multi-touch attribution use cases.
Agent: To see how many touch points it took to convert, understand the value attached to that, but using this type of granular connectivity with other types of API connectors that aren't really best suited to pull into the aggregate environment that we're used two for the type of standard campaign reporting.
Agent: So any questions there?
Agent: I just want to make sure I touch on
EndUser: That just for the technical aspects of setting up more granular use cases. Yeah, I mean, for me, this resonates because of all the data that we're going to bring in.
EndUser: But I also want to make sure that everyone on the team is able to ask their questions. So the level of user
Agent: Data here, it also goes deep into Interaction studio, right?
Agent: That's right. So we connect to that Redshift database for internet action studio data.
Agent: We pull that into here, stage it here, use it with other, you know, data sets for that attribution use case, and then surface up the attribution
EndUser: Queries directly from here into your normal work streams and data streams.
Agent: Great. So so that also goes into segments. That's right. So segment level performance, all of that.
Agent: You know, if you're doing that in personalization or in Marketing cloud, we'll work with you to set that up so you can have the level granulated for that pepper reporting.
Agent: And just to give you a kind of a visual on that. So once that's set up, I just had a dashboard here. I was going to show you, but.
Agent: You start to get to attribution kind of use cases where we can build into the dashboard. We can set it up with different models, last step, first touch, time decay, participation, [ORG-24] custom models.
Agent: Whatever it may be, we can start to view kind of the different campaigns, the different channels that they're interacting with before they convert to see different types of visualization and how to present that data.
Agent: So I just wanna touch on that, but, The way the data is set up, we're going to be heavily focused on your first party data since we don't actually tag your site and put pixels and [PRODUCT-6] on your site like other tools do.
Agent: We're going to be relying on the data coming from other platforms like [ORG-16] from [ORG-16] and the pixels you have deployed there.
Agent: And then pull that together to tell this kind of richer data story for attribution use cases.
Agent: So we're different in the sense that we stage it and set it up for those types of use cases without using our own custom pixels.
Agent: And the reason we- do that is because the way the kind of Marketing ecosystem has evolved . you know, cookies have evolved through third party cookies just don't work anymore.
Agent: So we're all reliant on using first party cookies, which in some cases now can expire after [DATE-18]. So, you know, browsers are starting to block even first party cookies after [DATE-21] in some cases.
Agent: And so we need to use other kind of data sources to tell that story and fill in some of those gaps, at least at the deterministic sense and attribution.
Agent: We have other kind of add-on tools that we work with partners with that can do more of the probabilistic. So when there are data gaps, we have really long conversion or kind of sales cycles with conversion points .
Agent: There's going to need to be some probabilistic type attribution put in, which is using third party data to fill in some of those gaps.
Agent: And we can talk about that when I get into marketplace and show you some of those other apps that you can add on. But attribution is a kind of a thorny subject. There's a lot of angles.
Agent: Just want to make sure we touch on it, because it involves a first party data setup that this tool is uniquely set up.
Speaker 7: Is uniquely kind of set up to actually take in that data, connect it, and harmonize it in a way so you can get to those types of attribution use cases.
Speaker 7: Is there other attribution models that are assisted in this?
Agent: Is there linear?
Agent: Is there first touch or what other allocation Yeah, so currently we have with our kind of setup, we do about seven different models. So this one doesn't have all of them deployed.
Agent: It looks like my first touch last touch time decay. There's a participation model. There's linear and then there's a custom weighted model. We can deploy different weights to different touch points.
Speaker 7: And then one other question as we're looking at kind of the conversion point, given that access conversions kind of have been flow depending on the funnel.
Speaker 7: So we could have an entry point that's obviously a conversion where, you know, the lead is generated.
Speaker 7: But when it actually comes down to the bottom funnel, how can we build that in?
Speaker 7: And there's typically a long delay.
Agent: And how does that impact your model?
Agent: So we'll be looking for ways to key off of any first party data that you're collecting about that individual.
Agent: So once they take some type of action, click through an ad, convert or become a lead, we can then take either data in [PRODUCT-7], data in Interaction student personalization, whatever it may be, if we have some type of unifying ID or key that we can work with, we can then stitch together in the model all the different touch points along the way.
Agent: So if you have a [DATE-24] look-back window where you want to see any cross-sell opportunities or things you've done to drive other.
Agent: Type of product interactions, we can look at that and do a look back when you're much longe r and look as long as that subscriber ID, the individual is the same in your database then we can tell that story So it provides some flexibility, but it's something we'll want to kind of explore wit h you as we work with a partner to implement this and set it up in a unique way for you r business Because attribution means different things to every business and so there's not an eas y decision .
Agent: Out of the box type of model for that. But if you have specific business goals for tracking these individuals, it can be set up because we have the flexibility of that granular data center.
Agent: We have access to all the different [ORG-4] data points and ecosystem there, as well as any other data you want to pull in for that attribution lifecycle. Great, thank you.
EndUser: Mm-hmm, yeah, great question. So with [TIME-4] left, just want to make sure we're going to data mapping and all that.
EndUser: So the team that we have here is very much on the acquisition channels and data [ORG-17] actually existed on the first on the advertising side, right?
EndUser: So if the team wants to also see anything that's specific to that, we can also make use of that time or we can have also further demos to dive a little bit deeper there.
Agent: Sure, great point. So you probably see that what I pulled up here is the actual data model itself. So this is a visualizer, kind of illustrating how the data model works.
Agent: So once we connect into the external data via API or through Total Connect, you can see how that data flows in and is neatly organized here by different buckets specific for that type of data.
Agent: So campaign data is all coming in neatly organized through all the different dimensions we'd expect in that kind of campaign data. different metrics are organized with our delivery data.
Agent: So across all of our ad platforms to understand impressions and clicks and delivery all of that in one place. But the nice thing here is that you're really standardizing on a Marketing specific data model.
Agent: So everything's being normalized, the data's cleaned up, and then you can use this as your master Marketing data record.
Agent: So whether you work with it solely in intelligence here and do all your dashboarding here, or you can even extend this.
Agent: You can access this data via an API or push it into our direct connection in the [PERSON-13] for further exploration. So lots of flexibility on how you extend this data out.
Agent: But really, this is the connected ETL process Organizing . basically cleaning up of all that data so you can make sense of it using it. It becomes very, very actionable and useful and valuable to the overall organization.
Agent: So if I want to know where certain data points are coming in from, how it's being organized, this is how I would kind of quickly visualize that, see all of our media buy data, but it's all neatly organized here, and then I can export this to share or have complete control over all the different data model entities here as well.
Agent: So this is something we can dive in deeper if you have, you know, technical folks that want to get into the data model, how it's organized, because I could spend [TIME-5] just on the data model itself, how we analyze the data, how we key off of certain data sets and create kind of this hierarchy.
Agent: So something we can follow up with, but just want to touch on this, so you can see how, you know, intelligence does it uniquely for Marketing specific data sets.
Agent: And I'm not going to go into this deeply, but I just also want to touch on how it can also key off of any types of specific naming mentions you guys follow.
Agent: So if you have campaign data that you follow certain taxonomies, we can read that, you know, single-seller data, so all the different rows of data that have different dimensions in them.
Agent: We can look up and actually deploy dimensions from those kind of campaigns and the taxonomies that you already have set up.
Agent: So you can see, for instance, from one-seller data that would usually need to be transformed and clean up prior to ingestion. We can take that data.
Agent: And extract it into the correct dimensions in the data mall as well . So it's really nice for quickly organizing, but also understanding.
Agent: If teams are following those naming conventions, if there's any gaps in the data, there's a full [FAC-2] to both organize it and watch that data flow in and quickly fix and maintain it as well directly in the UI without having to go back to the source reprocess all that data.
Agent: Something else we can spend more time on when we have a little more time, but just unique to this tool because we understand the pain
Speaker 7: Of cleaning up data before it can be organized for marketing, this is a really useful tool saving a lot of time for data admins and data scientists.
Agent: That's awesome.
Agent: Does it allow you to remap as well from here or is it just kind of a capture and fix?
Agent: You can remap it into the data model. I typically it's doing it at the data stream level, but yes, you can you can completely control the mapping as well.
Agent: So We're going to be looking for specific patterns, but if you deploy with a media name builder as well, if you use that, it'll deploy the patterns here as well and actually look for that data coming back in, create it, making sure it's being followed correctly.
Agent: So basically, if you have any gaps, you can quickly make those changes and not have those gaps in the actual dashboards themselves. Great. Thank you. All right, so now I want to touch on our media planning.
Agent: So I'm going to jump over to our marketplace. and we talked about [ORG-30] here in [ORG-24].
Agent: The media pacing, I'll skip over that for now, but let's jump into [ORG-24] because I really love this app. It can be really useful. So essentially, our [ORG-24], you deploy your [ORG-33].
Agent: So basically, you set up your plan, whether you do that in [PRODUCT-4] [DATE-1] or any other tools that you're setting up and following your plan. You can ingest it directly from those files into this app specifically.
Agent: But then from here, once I have my planning here, I can break it down up to five different dimensions deep. So we have this specific one-channel platform and strategy.
Agent: But if we have different ways we adjust the budget or have granularity in that plan, we can input that into this view. And then I can make adjustments directly in the app here.
Agent: But more importantly, it's going to be taking this plan.
Agent: And once you activate it with data flowing in through our different connectors, we can then track how you're performing to that plan and then offer suggestions and insights using [PERSON-12] to optimize that plan.
Agent: And so here you're going to get, obviously, historical analysis using the data that we have coming into the platform. But then we also have forecasting.
Agent: So you can see what that plan is projected to drive as far as different KPIs you want to track, whether it's web visits or leads.
Agent: You can basically select any [ORG-12] in the data model and have the plan optimized towards that. Then once this plan is deployed, we have optimizations flowing in.
Agent: So you can start to see [PERSON-12] letting you know, hey, consider spending less maybe on search because our Cough for Visit is much higher than other channels like video or with display.
Agent: And so you'll get updated insights along the way as this data is flowing back in. And then you can also run simulations on that plan as well.
Agent: So say, for instance, you get another $[MONEY-3] in Marketing budget that you didn't expect, and you want to know how you should best deploy that.
Agent: You can add a scenario where you boost your plan by $[MONEY-3] and then see how that will affect your different KPIs tied to that plan. And so here's a few different scenarios. Included in that is our EMI scenario.
Agent: This is where actual [PERSON-12] is allocating your budget for you. And so you can view that scenario as well and see what you would expect if [PERSON-12] were to do those allocations on your behalf.
Agent: Keep in mind, this is not actually activating the media plan, it's not going into the platforms and the point you still have to activate according to the plan, but it does take the plan and then get the inputs as the data flows back in for optimization opportunities.
Agent: And then here you can see different comparisons. I can see, you know, different scenarios, different forecast methods here.
Agent: But just giving you a complete view of what's happening historically and what is forecasted to happen in the future according to your different KPIs and Marketing goals.
Speaker 7: Any questions on this so far?
Speaker 7: Yeah, it does.
Speaker 7: Now looking at the data, how does it incorporate any competitive insights to help?
Speaker 7: Understand what can we differentiate between or is this
Agent: Just more pure planning, optimization focus?
Agent: Yeah, because we're not actually pulling in competitive data for this, usually that data is a little more specific to the actual channel or the platforms you're advertising on because tools like [ORG-9], for instance, or [ORG-36], they're kind of walled gardens in the sense that they don't give you a lot of information to go and use in third party tools.
Agent: And so we're kind of restricted to what we can see. We can actually help you with competitive intelligence for public posts, like organic social posts and things like that, because that data is readily available.
Agent: But when it comes to actual media planning, this tool's not integrating in competitive data. It's simply just looking
Speaker 7: At your first party data for that.
Agent: But on that line of thinking, we do have really great third party apps that we have in our marketplace, specific for that type of question.
Agent: So that's just, I'm talking about [ORG-28] here, but when it comes to looking at attribution and probabilistic type of media mix modeling, we have tools like, let me give you an example here.
Agent: A partner [ORG-28] that creates an app for our marketplace, using the data that's already in the data model that we're connected to.
Agent: It deploys an app on top of that data to let you know how, you know, what different channels are actually driving performance, how they're driving revenue, suggested admins and kind of, you know, media mix changes and suggestions here.
Agent: But this is using the data, the first party data you have and also other third party data that is in their own model from [ORG-28].
Agent: And so it can help kind of fill in some of those gaps and understanding maybe what, you know, what Additional inventory might be available in the marketplace to drive some of these other channels up drive additional Revenue because obviously that can change over time in a very competitive landscape.
Agent: So this is one aspect of that. So [ORG-28] makes a really great app for that type of MMM type scenario. And then there's another one called Marketing evolution, which is a attribution partner.
Agent: They specialize in a multi channel and multi touch attribution. Here it is right here. And they have another app that allows you to use scenario planning as well. So understanding exactly what your.
Agent: Your plan is understanding what channels you should be reinvesting in, getting you full conversion details, using site data and web analytics data from [ORG-36], all tied in for their attribution model, and allows you to also do scenario planning as well, using third-party data.
Agent: So this is actually taking data across your industry, understanding even if you want to break it down by regions or DMAs, they have really rich data that they get from, I believe [ORG-37] and [PRODUCT-8] and some of the big third-party data providers to understand what historical data is.
Agent: Performance is for a lot of these campaigns and how you should allocat e adjust accordingly with that data flowing in.
Agent: So if you're really powerful, I woul d have Marketing evolution talking about this more fully to understand exactl y how it's making those calculations, but they have some pretty outstandin g claims as far as ROI for this tool specifically.
Agent: And we've had some client s be really successful in driving return on ad spin with this tool. So it ties i n multifaceted attribution and MMM in a way that's really effective .
Speaker 7: Interesting.
Speaker 7: And did you say [ORG-28] and sorry if I miss her but did you say it's able to capture available inventory and the universe that is part of the mix so it provides actual help with the [ORG-36] and that regards
Agent: Or did I did I misinterpret?
Agent: So as far as I know, it does. This might be old information. I don't work for [ORG-28], so I'll help to check in with them.
Agent: But as far as I know, they're using their own proprietary data sets to append and understand what's driving performance across these different platforms and channels. But it also ties in.
Agent: You can see here, it uses your [ORG-16] data to tie in for the multi-touch attribution data. So it's going to do some of that ID mapping with that web analytics data to understand multi-touch attribution Got you.
Speaker 7: Use cases for that.
Agent: All right, so I know I only left [TIME-6] for [PERSON-10] here. We went through a lot. I know we had a lot of different things to cover.
Agent: I didn't touch on our Einstein Marketing insight bots and all of our Analyze and Act section, but I can save that for another follow-up because there's really great things here with [PERSON-12] and how we can help you optimize with your first party data.
Agent: But I did want to make sure we touched on the [ORG-30] and the MMM side because I know that's really important to your media team. So With that, I appreciate you guys. You're really great questions, really great input.
Agent: I'm happy to do a follow-up demo or dive into any deeper dive into any other aspects that we didn't see [DATE-1] or something you want to see a little more detail on.
Agent: But I appreciate all the great engagement [DATE-1].
EndUser: All right, perfect. [PERSON-10], I'm pretty sure we can have follow-up sessions as well.
EndUser: But again, because we have our Marketing team here, just want to make sure that we at least covered the very first things that we wanted to see.
EndUser: So [ORG-3], [ORG-36], is there anything else that you want to ask?
EndUser: We have [TIME-7] because there's really a lot of aspects of the platform
Speaker 8: Can dive a lot more . deeper later on. Thank you for watching. Yeah, one quick question. So, [ORG-36] testing is going to be a big initiative of ours [DATE-24].
Speaker 8: And I don't think it's going to be anything drastic enough to, you know, impact what feeds into this dashboard.
Speaker 8: But are there certain instances in [GPE-1], you may have covered the soybeans if so, where we can maybe exclude certain campaigns or exclude certain landing pages for certain periods of time, just so that they
Agent: Don't, you know, because there was a test running that might have, you know, impacted how. efficient that channel might be . Certainly.
Agent: Yeah, so it's really easy to filter out any specific data sets, whether it's at campaigns, at the widget level or at the entire dashboard level. So very flexible that way.
Agent: I know I didn't go through a lot of those kind of easy user kind of features in the dashboarding side, but it's very simple to filter out any campaigns.
Agent: You could even do it at the data stream level if you want it completely obscured from the data set. But we do really help with the AB testing set because we could actually do incrementality analysis with you.
Agent: So understand. you know, baseline analytics from the data set and they're saying how a campaign
EndUser: Actually drove performance on top of your baseline with kind of those incrementality type o f of use cases. Yeah, I was going to say all those testing would also be additional insights that we
Speaker 8: Can also layer in here.
Speaker 7: Awesome. Thank you. And I don't know if we have time to go into a lot of this. I'm going to probably get too far into the weeds.
Speaker 7: But one of the things that I would be interested in knowing more is just how does the [ORG-4]. tackle the cross device interactions and how does that impact in the customer
Agent: Journey and an attribution of those touch points and conversions?
Agent: Understood. Yeah, that's something we need to spend a little more time on.
Agent: We'll have to talk about how we implement the tool and the type of personalization data we can get access to help with that because a lot of that, either takes place in a customer data platform like [LOC-1], or because you have interactions to your personalization data, that unknown to known type of cross device interaction, is being handled there, and so we can utilize that data set to help us help that story.
EndUser: Yeah, we have some stitching that happens on the [ORG-37] studio site, so we can definitely make use of that.
EndUser: And as part of our bigger roadmap, we're also still looking for a bigger identity resolution for more of the across device stitching that we wanted to do.
Agent: You know, just to touch on that, that honestly could be data cloud. And I know what we're working through with [PERSON-12] on kind of that, but I think he's close to kind of completing his proof of concept.
Agent: So, very intrigued and interested in having more conversations and kind of looping you and really the whole Marketing side of the business. The application there. So we're, we're pretty darn close on that, which will unlock.
EndUser: And [PERSON-12]'s words, box, but in a good way.
Agent: Open up [PRODUCT-9]'s Yeah.
EndUser: We're really going to fly that across the business. And [PERSON-10], let's have a separate, even just [TIME-8] into that because I was not involved at all on the concept on the Data Cloud side.
EndUser: So we definitely want anything closest.
Agent: To get into that before
EndUser: Because I want to make sure that we also get to play in the sandbox there and see it for whatever we need on the, especially for the marketing.
Agent: Can use sever e Yeah, for sure.
Agent: I think he just wants to prove out the technology and he's pretty darn close right now and then it'll be really pulling that in to have like the use cases across the business marketing, obviously being the big focus and you know where we could apply
EndUser: Data cloud, how that would scale, etc.
Agent: I'm getting at it from more on the data structure side. Data structure to really create those unified profiles to surface additional attributes off of those unified profiles in real-time to better segment and activate.
Agent: Yup, so really that hyper personalization being able to see that granular view of every touch point a customer has had with access, whether that be on sales service marketing, the web app, you know, those flowing in then to that unified profile and on those insights Yeah, okay.
EndUser: Being able to action quickly.
Agent: That's good. Yeah, so are just I know we're [TIME-7] over. But this was my kind of proposed timeline. I wanted to make sure this tracks with you.
Agent: Like you mentioned, quick follow up really to get some more feedback.
Agent: We added that granular data center, which after talking to [PERSON-7] and knowing how deep you wanted to get with multi-touch attribution, that was going to be something we needed to add to the plan.
Agent: There's a slight change to the proposal structure with that, but I made it very minimal, very minimal. But I want to talk with you about that.
Agent: And then as far as the next call goes, I know we wanted to dive deeper into the back end data.
Agent: There's some questions about how we can set that up, you know, just the Implementation and what data we want to pull in.
Agent: Do you want to bring in a partner?
Agent: We're in next call where we dive deeper into data structure and really which use cases you're going to solve for how we need to actually set up Marketing Cloud intelligence. But that makes sense for an kind of writing
EndUser: Ex-call to have someone co-pilot with us.
EndUser: That would be doing the hands-on implementation?
EndUser: Or are you thinking more?
EndUser: It's the key to doing that. Yeah, because I'm looking at this from different angles. So for example, we have [ORG-36] and [ORG-3].
EndUser: They're really deep into the, [ORG-3] more on the optimization and conversion, and then [ORG-36] on the paid channels.
EndUser: So I want to make sure that we get all the functionalities understood also, but that their teams are going to be using.
EndUser: And then the data side of it is, you know, I mean, for me I already like the ingestion and the harmonization The backend, so we can take, you know, more sessions even separately if you want But that would be a different team For example, we would make the [ORG-28] to make that work So, yeah, my priority is to make sure that, you know the Marketing teams have all the use case s and the functionalities there for what is needed for [DATE-3] recurring, you know, all of the.
EndUser: .. Things that we would use the platform for. So if that is through a partner, I don't know yet, but maybe there is another session just to go deeper into some of the functionalities.
EndUser: And there's a lot of widgets and apps that could also be implemented with it, right?
EndUser: So I can catch up separately with the team here and then I can share with you some next steps in where we want it.
Agent: Terms of
EndUser: Deeper and then maybe one understand also the partner side of things .
Agent: With you separately. Yeah, that sounds good.
Agent: And if this timeline is running a little bit too fast and we need to have some, let's say two or three separate sessions to really dive deeper on this, I totally understand that.
Agent: So we'll take your lead and that's really good feedback. So just let me know kind of what you think you need to see and who we need to get involved in those conversations.
Agent: We'll make sure we bring the right people on our side Yeah, sounds good.
EndUser: And we'll kind of go from there.
Agent: Awesome. All right. Well, thank you so much. I'll really appreciate it. And I will definitely follow up with you and we'll be in touch for a next conversation very soon.
EndUser: Thank you, [PERSON-16]. Yeah, because we definitely want to Thank you
Agent: Move fast also.

The seller mentions that the customer's boss had a conflict and could not attend the call. However, the customer does not mention any blockers related to decision-making authority.

As for the agreed-upon next steps, the seller proposes a quick follow-up to get feedback on the proposal and discuss the addition of the granular data center. They also plan to have a deeper call to discuss the back-end data, implementation, and use cases. The customer agrees to provide feedback and next steps, including potentially involving a partner for the hands-on implementation.

In summary, while it is unclear if the right decision maker was present, both parties have agreed to continue the conversation and take next steps to move the deal forward.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of Marketing Cloud intelligence to provide a single view of performance metrics across their disparate marketing channels, reduce manual efforts in data preparation and harmonization, and improve media mix modeling.

However, there are a few areas where they could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific use cases and requirements:

1. Competitive insights: The customer asked about how the platform incorporates competitive insights. The sales rep mentioned that they don't integrate competitive data, but they have third-party apps in their marketplace that can help with competitive intelligence. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific needs around competitive insights and recommending the most appropriate third-party apps.
2. Cross-device interactions: The customer asked about how the platform tackles cross-device interactions and how it impacts customer journeys and attribution. The sales rep acknowledged that they need to spend more time on this topic and mentioned that they are working on a proof of concept with Data Cloud.

1. ""What brought us here and why we're having this conversation?""
2. ""Is there anything that I might have missed or anything else that you really want to dive deep on?""
3. ""What is Marketing Cloud intelligence again just at a high level before we kick it over to [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-7] to dive deeper?""
4. ""Does that sound good to everyone?""
5. ""What types of questions, comments, feedback do you have on this model that I went through?""

7. ""Any questions on that?""
8. ""Can you describe pacing and how you know how your system creates that?""
9. ""Are there certain instances in [ORG-30], you may have covered the soybeans if so, where we can maybe exclude certain campaigns or exclude certain landing pages for certain periods of time, just so that they don't, you know, because there was a test running that might have, you know, impacted how. efficient that channel might be?""

video_19763_167_6qr3y000000ohAcAAI,"Agent: Okay. [PERSON-1]. So let me share my screen while I do that. I'm actually in [LOC-1] [DATE-1] on, or I guess [DATE-2]. Oh, [PERSON-2], that's low. Well, good [PERSON-2].
Agent: And we're, I'm on [ORG-1], so I just moved my mom to the, uh, the peak [TIME-1] plan. I'm sure [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], you guys, you guys know this.
Agent: So we're like, um, Now it's like, don't do laundry between five and eight, blah, blah. And it's like, uh, I looked at you guys mission statement [DATE-3] delivering freedom to, to [NORP-1] through renewable energy.
Agent: And now I feel on it. Cause we're like, you're a soldier We need a new roof first.
EndUser: Off work about that.
EndUser: We can put that in the solar financing.
Agent: It's good to know.
Agent: Okay, well, I won't digress too much, but [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], thanks for your time [TIME-2]. We do appreciate it. And then [PERSON-5] can catch the recording. We're excited to continue the conversation with you.
Agent: And before we jump into the demo and introduce the [ORG-2] folks on the line, typically is where we take a step back and make sure that we're all moving in the same direction and we're helping you build for your [DATE-4].
Agent: So we got together to the [ORG-3] team and we thought about the vision for flagship that got lined and for the sake of thinking about how we solution for you, we categorized your goals into three different buckets.
Agent: So the number one goal we heard was growth. I think I heard that the goals get to 1,000 projects a month as soon as possible and become a national brand in [DATE-5].
Agent: You guys laid out some pretty significant and exciting growth plans.
Agent: And then you also, I think correctly identified that you want to accomplish that growth while simultaneously protecting your company's brand and the culture that's made you so successful best far.
Agent: Talk about so much of differentiating yourself from the [EVENT-1] is really in the customer experience that you provide.
Agent: And then the last facet that we talked about sort of categorically was finding ways to move the business in a way that's more efficient and remove manual processes.
Agent: We know solar is a complex business and there's a lot of stakeholders to manage and we talked about the concept of finding ways to make those processes repeatable so you can drag and drop them across the country.
Agent: [PERSON-3], I know you give us just one example of like a financing disclosure. I think that needs to be read by the salesperson before you can move forward with the installation.
Agent: I'm sure there's plenty of other places that are right for optimization. I know [PRODUCT-1] and [PERSON-6] probably has some ideas for you as well.
Agent: But [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], at a high level, do we capture the goals?
Agent: Or did we miss anything that you feel like should be categorically in there?
EndUser: Yeah, pretty much efficiency for me.
EndUser: Like when we were starting out, it was super easy for myself, [PERSON-5], and [PERSON-7] to do all the back-and-work, and then, That's not like we have like a super good small group of people and it's not scalable.
EndUser: And you focused on or like a people company. We want to grow into a system based company. And hopefully I could see our animal help with that.
Agent: Yeah. [PERSON-8] into the in the next slide here.
Agent: So we we thought about those goals and we thought about the obstacles that might get in your way both that we talked about in our last conversation and that we've seen other folks run into.
Agent: As their businesses grow and mature. And typically there's three key areas where obstacles pop up. And the first one, [PERSON-3], just like you said, scalability.
Agent: So building a foundation that's scalable and I suspect sustainable growth will continue to be one of the most important areas that you plan for and finding ways to standardize those business processes in a way that is repeatable when you can't drag and drop, like I said, while also doing so in a way that sets you apart is going to be cute.
Agent: The second is maintaining what we'll think of as like a brand or your customer centricity. We talked about customer centricity being a strategic advantage and solar.
Agent: And we often see that as our customers grow, maintaining that focus becomes more and more difficult and getting buy into that culture becomes increasingly challenging as you add layers to your business.
Agent: And then the third category for key challenges that we're thinking about how to solve for is in the area of automation. This kind of speaks back to efficiency, but we all know obviously manual processes and habit and efficiency.
Agent: You've probably experienced customers becoming frustrated. They can also leave your team frustrated and they just don't scale. So something we started talking about at [DATE-6] conversation was the concept of visibility and reporting and data.
Agent: I know this is important for like [PERSON-5] talks about it, but the salespeople are installation managers knowing where to start [DATE-7].
Agent: But also for the executive team, like the folks on this one two be able to optimize processes and measure effectiveness as you grow.
Agent: So I won't articulate, I won't belabor the point with our positioning too much here because it sounds like the flags to folks on the phone are pretty much on board.
Agent: [PERSON-5], it's Trent essentially verbalized what sets [ORG-3] apart in our first discussion. We probably have a great career at [ORG-3] and we chose to work here.
Agent: I know you guys have already looked at a couple of alternatives, but really [ORG-3] is the solution for [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: We don't see, candidly, a lot of Competition in this industry aside from those custom built solutions that you guys have mentioned before. And even that isn't really necessary.
Agent: We have plenty of [MONEY-1] Solar companies that run on [ORG-3]. It's flexible enough to encase your entire customer journey inside of from that first door knock or inbound call or whatever lead source is to [ORG-4] and referral.
Agent: It's also simple enough that with the help of a [ORG-2] with folks on the phone, we can get you rolling quickly and let you focus on the areas that are going to really move the business forward.
Agent: So just to give you both kind of a preview of what [PERSON-2] will walk through [DATE-8], we're going to focus on sort of that phase one approach if you will.
Agent: So we'll take you from the lead, wherever the source is. I put [PERSON-9] knock here, but it could be inbound through managing that opportunity through some of the project management capabilities.
Agent: And then throughout, we'll speak on reporting and analytics. And I'll also adhere, [PERSON-2] put together a great demo. But we did make this into enough business days.
Agent: So [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], if you see something, you're like, that's not exactly how we were thinking of this, or we're envisioning something else. Let's talk about it.
Agent: We have all the folks on the phone here to have a productive conversation. Ultimately, this is your time. So [PERSON-2], well, you kind of get ready. At this point, I know you both know myself, [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-10]. Right.
Agent: On folks, [PRODUCT-1] and [PERSON-6], if you want to give a quick intro and say hi to [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], that'd be great. Yeah, I see. Sure thing.
Agent: Yep. Yep. Yep, we can do so. And so what's again, pleasure to me. You guys here. My name is [PERSON-11]. I'm the CEO of [ORG-2]. We are a certified sales force Implementation partner.
Agent: And the entire reason that we exist is help clients get the most value out of their sales force investment, but then also to understand how sales force can be configured for their specific needs.
Agent: So one of the reasons why we're on this call here is to help answer questions as they arise, help to provide some context in terms of how we've been clients to be successful with sales force, especially in the solar industry.
Agent: And so I'm happy to be on the call eager to kind of dive in a little bit deeper. And with that, I'll pass it over to [PERSON-6]. Hi [PERSON-3], hi
Agent: [PERSON-4], nice to meet you both. So I work alongside [PRODUCT-1] on the sales side of the house at [ORG-2]. I'm local to [LOC-2]. So I'm our [LOC-2] presence here.
Agent: I spend a lot of time with [PERSON-11] and [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-2] in the [ORG-3] office. Great to meet you and looking forward to working together.
EndUser: Nice to meet you guys.
EndUser: Yeah, very nice to meet you guys. Thank you.
Agent: All right, my internet's a little slow, so I apologize in advance.
Agent: It always happens when you have a demo, huh?
Agent: I think you guys can see my screen. Hopefully you can see a [ORG-3] screen.
Agent: Are you going to see that?
Agent: We see it.
Agent: Ok, perfect.
Agent: And on the bottom right, are you able to see all your faces?
Agent: Is it blocking anything?
Agent: Do I need to zoom in or reserve being perfect?
Agent: Cool. I'll take the head not as a.
Agent: With your faces, I don't know if you're wanting that or not.
Agent: That's fine. I just want to have that way. I can visually kind of connect with you guys. But if it gets in the way, just let me know. I'll move it.
Agent: So what you're seeing here is [ORG-3] and remind me again, um, team that remind me again, flagship team that if you guys are familiar with [ORG-3], I believe some of your team members didn't have any experience with [ORG-3], but I'll ask again, like, have you seen the screen before?
Agent: Has it been a while since you've seen this?
EndUser: I personally have, uh, coming from another company that used it and taking the admin test. So I've definitely before.
Agent: Seen this
EndUser: I don't know if [PERSON-3] has though.
EndUser: I haven't seen it on [ORG-3], no.
Agent: Cool. Okay. Well, and I also know this is being recorded. So I'll try to keep it high level, but also. I'll give a lay of the land real quick before we dive into some of the specifics.
Agent: So what you're seeing here is the desktop view of our [PRODUCT-3]. And so you can access this both on any computer, of course, all cloud based, but also on mobile devices.
Agent: So what you're seeing here is what you would get on the mobile device, just in a much smaller screen. And I'm happy to show that at the end that we have some time.
Agent: But basically everything you're seeing here would be accessible to you on mobile and even works offline.
Agent: So if you're ever in an area where maybe you're putting a, you know, a roof or a solar panel without reception, you can still log information input data into the [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: And then whenever you get back into a service area, then you're able to automatically actually update the information for you. So what you're seeing here is what we call. our [PRODUCT-3] app.
Agent: And so apps are ways to group multiple tabs within your [PRODUCT-3]. So for example, here I called this one [PRODUCT-3] because this kind of encompasses everything inside of my point of view here. So I have access to leads.
Agent: I have access to my properties, which will get into a little bit deeper on what properties are, but basically just think of these as their accounts. I have access to my clients, my opportunities, et cetera.
Agent: But in the home page, I have the ability to see if I'm the person who wants to see basically the bigger picture.
Agent: I can see my sales, my total sales up to date, my marketing leads, any tickets that are coming in, via support.
Agent: And if I scroll a little bit further, I can even see, you know, pipeline and then the sales leaderboard. So it's basically an all-encompassing dashboard. that shows me everything I need to know about the business at a glance.
Agent: I also have access at a glance to look at my calendar events and my tasks. And these are actually being imported in from my calendar, whether it's Outlook 411 or [ORG-5].
Agent: So either way, as long as the connection is made there, you'll be able to see these inside of [ORG-3] so that you don't have to hop around between different tools. I also have the ability to see key opportunities.
Agent: And I can quickly jump into one of these, or I can also see key projects. So basically, I can put anything that I need to quickly access the moment I log into [ORG-3].
Agent: Now this can be completely tailored and configured. And that's actually the reason why we have these apps. So if I switch over here to sales. We could have an app for the sales team.
Agent: We could have an app for the operations team, or marketing as you guys grow. So basically you're able to have a different point of view, depending on who's logged in and what profile they have.
Agent: So if I'm a sales person here and I log into the sales app, that's all I can see, right?
Agent: So I now have the ability to see everything relating to sales. Pipeline, activities, tie back to sales, phone calls made. forecast, top accounts. And again, the same applies two for all the other apps.
Agent: The service one might be a little more tailored for tickets or complaints from customers, projects, of course, the actual projects.
Agent: But again, [PRODUCT-3] is the one that I kind of created for everything that we can navigate in one app. I just wanted to show you the power of being able to have multiple personas within the same platform.
Agent: So that way you're still able to access the same data. You may just have a different point of view.
Agent: And you can also limit what each person sees or what they're able to control, whether it's edit rights or just being able to read You have a lot of flexibility there with [ORG-3] to be with .
Agent: Create the hierarchy that you need two for your users.
Agent: So what we're going to work with here first, I could jump into, you know, an opportunity here, I could jump into a project, but we're actually going to start at the very beginning, [PERSON-11] mentioned, we're going to start with, you know, somebody essentially being knocked at their door being knocked on, and us sort of introducing ourselves and telling them about Black Shift and basically just gathering some information from them.
Agent: So what we're seeing here is a lead record. And so very quickly, I just clicked into the lead record here by clicking on leads. And then we have what we call list views.
Agent: Just think of these as custom filters to be able to navigate through all the different leads that you have. The same sort of functionality applies to every object or every tab at the top.
Agent: So if I click on properties, you can see the same thing here. I have ListView. So basically, it's a way to navigate through and filter through all the data.
Agent: And so I can create my own [ORG-6] if I wanted to. Or I can share these if I want to share with the rest of the company.
Agent: But I have the ability to basically create filters using some of the fields that already exist. So I can filter via the company name or the title or email address.
Agent: In this scenario, I'm just going to stick with the recently viewed leads. And so I see [PERSON-10] here. But if I needed to create one very quickly.
Agent: I could also just click this little carrot and hit new lead and then from here I could choose the type of lead.
Agent: So we have multiple types of leads that we can create And then you fill out the information. So again, this works exactly the same way on mobile.
Agent: So you could click new lead and start filling the information and then hit save. Now keep in mind, there's a lot of fields here. By default, you're not going to have all these fields.
Agent: You're probably going to just have the sort of the general ones that you would expect. So first name, last name, list status, email address, phone number.
Agent: But then it's up to [PERSON-14] and team, [ORG-7] team, to be able to configure this and mold this to look exactly like how you're going to do it.
Agent: You needed to look Because I know there's certain pieces of informatio n that you need to capture from those lead s or those prospects when you go knocking door to door .
Agent: And so again, I already filled out some of this information for [PERSON-11]. So the scenario would be, you know, if I go and not get [PERSON-11]'s door.
Agent: And I say, you know, I'm canvassing the area trying to figure out if you're interested for solar panels. As I'm asking those questions, I can start to fill out some of this information very quickly by hitting the pencil.
Agent: So once I hit the pencil, I kind of go into edit mode.
Agent: So if I need to correct, you know, the last name to [PERSON-13]'s or anything like that, I could, I could change that information and quickly hit save.
Agent: But I also have the ability to customize or configure whatever is on the screen. So if I need to add an additional field of something you don't see here, very quickly without any code, you're able to configure that.
Agent: Again, that's mostly what [ORG-7] team is going to do. But I just wanted to highlight that what you're seeing here is completely flexible. I'll take a second here to pause.
Agent: Any any questions, [PERSON-14]?
EndUser: No, it's pretty straightforward.
Agent: Okay. Well, I'm trying to keep it simple. So if I if it's too simple, you know, let me know, but I do want to make sure that I don't overwhelm.
Agent: Because there's a lot to see here on the screen. But very simply so far what we've done is we've just looked at a lead record.
Agent: And what's cool about this is if I need to communicate with [PERSON-11], let's say I gather all the information for [PERSON-11], even some files that you can see here.
Agent: I have the ability to upload files, maybe I took some pictures of the home.
Agent: As I'm communicating with him, if I leave and I need to reach back out via email or via phone call, I have the ability to log that activity here. So let me move this up here.
Agent: So when I click on the email, I could now see this window pop up. And so I can actually type in an email from here.
Agent: And again, because it's connected to my email on the back end, I can send them an email. It's going to look like it's coming just for me from my email address.
Agent: So you really have the ability to type in your email, but you also have the ability to use templates, which is really the magic here. Because we have all this information already in.
Agent: Inside of our [PRODUCT-3], like [PERSON-11]'s first name or his addres s or even his email address We can click on one of these template s and some of these templates come with what we call merge fields which basically mean that there are field s that look at the record and they import piece s of information for you So let me see if I can enter another one .
Agent: Okay, so let me do this one here. Cool, so there you go. So now you're able to see there the the merch bills I was referring to.
Agent: And so if we click preview here, I can actually see what that email would look like. And you notice here that the name is filled in. So that's really where you start to get the interim productivity.
Agent: This is how you get can get ahead. You don't have to fill out things manually. You don't have to go and look for things. Everything's all in place.
Agent: And it's even automatically putting information there for you, helping you sort of speed up the process.
Agent: But if I want to reach out to [PERSON-11], and let's say I need to schedule something, either a phone call to discuss next steps, or I need to figure out whether this is even a real deal that has [PERSON-11] backed out, is he getting cold feet?
Agent: I'm sure that happens a lot in your business. So if I just need to reach out to him, I can eat.
Agent: Either send a scheduling link allowing [PERSON-11] y to schedule a time with me, or I can select some times . And so again, because it's connected to my calendar, it's going to pull in my availability.
Agent: And then I can select a few times here, but I can even add another person. So in another, another attending. So in this scenario, I could add [PERSON-11] as my counterpart to make sure we're both available.
Agent: I could name, you know, the event here, select template if I want to. Enter location, etc, and then add it to the body of the email. And so now.
Agent: I'm sure you guys have seen this ender since it a few times already, but this is how I'm able to schedule something with [PERSON-11] automatically start working with him. So that's the idea behind communicating within within [ORG-3].
Agent: And you can do this from any record. So you can do this from the account. You can do this from the lead. You can do this from the opportunity, the quote, the project.
Agent: Doesn't matter where you have the ability to access this Is it just for the.
EndUser: Activity for you.
Agent: Not right.
Agent: Sorry, text messages?
EndUser: What was that, [PERSON-3]?
EndUser: Is it just with email or can you send
Agent: So you can also do text messages now, natively out of the box with what we're proposing. Email is included. So it's at no additional cost. The text messages is an additional, it's an add-on.
Agent: So we would have to provide you with that pricing, but essentially it's just an easy add-on and then it would give you the option, just like you secure the email, so you would now have the option to
EndUser: Send the text.
Agent: Is that something you guys do a lot in the business?
Agent: It takes more
EndUser: Than email?
EndUser: Yeah, we've just seen a lot better We don't really open emails as much as we'd like responses.
Agent: Anymore, to. No, no, I hear you. Well, yeah, I think just the sort of the flexibility and the casualness of being able to text back is just a lot easier for, or much more convenient for customers nowadays.
Agent: So we definitely see that on our end as a requirement. So we can absolutely do that. Again, we'll discuss what it looks like in the end here. Again. Communicating with [PERSON-11], we send everything we need.
Agent: And so we can actually walk through these stages. And when I say walkthrough, I mean, we can just click on the different stages and market is current. And this is really the important piece of the [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: The marking things, the way they are, where you're currently, and at what stage you are with the customer or the prospect, this is what's going to drive your pipeline.
Agent: Now, of course, this is still a lead, so I can, I can, you know, mark it as qualified, or I can convert it.
Agent: And converted would be when I know I have an actual opportunity, you know, this would be considered a hot lead or somebody that I know I'm going to do potentially business with, even if later on, it turns out we didn't.
Agent: This is just a good way to filter out anybody who maybe got referred to you, who maybe doesn't own a house or they have no say in whether you can install the solar panel and just a lead that you consider not viable.
Agent: That's how you would be able to kind of. filter them out . So once I hit convert, then what would what would happen is sales were just going to see it's going to pull in information for me.
Agent: So I could have it pull in the address if I wanted to their first name, whatever I want to pull in, but it's going to allow me to create a contact and an account as well as an opportunity.
Agent: And so what it's going to do is it's going to create all three records for me. And it's going to connect them to the get together. So I don't have to go and do anything afterwards.
Agent: But what happens is now, if I'm for sure going to work with [PERSON-11] and we need to go inspect the house, again, I can type in the address here.
Agent: But it's also going to search for duplicates just to make sure that it doesn't already exist. So here it's already searching.
Agent: But then I can also do my own search to if I want to merge it with another account or contact.
Agent: Now, here I've already created an account for [PERSON-11], so we can actually just move over to the properties tab. And on the properties, again, this is simply just your account.
Agent: So this is just think of this as the record where everything about [PERSON-11]'s home falls. And so you can name the property, you can name it. By default, I think it's called account in [ORG-3].
Agent: I know it's called account, sorry. But I've been getting into the motion of calling them properties, especially in your field and your industry. It seems to resonate a little bit more.
Agent: But yeah, this is just basically the record that houses everything you need to know about them.
Agent: What's great about this approach here with the property and using the address as the name is that if [PERSON-11] ever moves, you know, [PERSON-11] is just a contact at this account.
Agent: So we can always move this contract record to another house.
Agent: And that way, you know, the property is still our customer since the roof is, or the solar panel is ours and that way if we have to do any maintenance or maybe in the future go and reinstall it.
Agent: We still have our account here in [ORG-3]. But basically here I have all the details about the home, the address, the owner of the account.
Agent: I have pictures, I have the ability to see any activity that was communicated with any contact at this house.
Agent: So that's another thing too, is you have the ability to not just capture [PERSON-11], but [PERSON-11]'s wife maybe or housekeeper, anybody that has access to the home that you might need to communicate with, you can track them as a contact here.
Agent: And that way when you email or call them, all that information is tracked. Everybody in the company is up to date as to what the last communication was and what was said.
Agent: And any questions, I'll take a second pause here.
EndUser: No, no questions so far.
Agent: Well, any thoughts as to how this compares with how you're currently doing things and oh, and that's pretty manual, but does this look like the much.
Agent: Easier place to capture things or do you see any sort of hesitation?
Agent: Do you anticipate any hesitation from the team?
EndUser: No, it's pretty similar to it. Just different layout than job nimbus or issues with job [ORG-8] is lack of automation.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Can you give me an example of one?
EndUser: So say just like one. Like say, it had designs done and it moves to ready for permitting, Like unassigning in this case, [PERSON-16] is doing our CAD designs right now.
Agent: Like removing.
EndUser: He's our engineer. So we're moving or [PERSON-16] and then assigning [PERSON-6] to
Agent: Tell her to start working on permitting. Got it. Got it. Yeah. So here at [ORG-3], you can do things either manually or automatically using some logic here, but...
Agent: Within the account record, I can click on this little icon and I can reassign it to somebody else.
Agent: So I could select [ORG-9] now and I can transfer not just the account, but all the opportunities owned, all the activity. I can even keep the same teams that are associated with this.
Agent: But I have the ability to automatically transfer everything over to [ORG-9] or someone else.
Agent: Or I can also automate that and I'll show you what that looks like here in a second when I move the stages on the opportunity. So speaking of opportunities.
Agent: So again, we have the information about the account, but now more specifically, if we go to sales, we have the ability to see any existing quotes and also any existing opportunities.
Agent: And so this opportunity is the one that we created a second ago. when we converted [PERSON-11] into a contact and an opportunity, this is really where we capture the information about the deal.
Agent: Now, one thing [PERSON-11] and I were discussing is whether you want to separate your opportunity and your projects. or if you want to keep them into one record.
Agent: And I'll kind of, I think that's something you don't have to worry about right now, but you might want to start thinking about that.
Agent: And then especially as you have the conversations with [PERSON-16], they're going to suggest the best approach in their mind.
Agent: But what I've done here is I created a separate opportunity And so this opportunity, again, is mostly meant for the salespeople to be able to track things like the amount when they expect to close this.
Agent: Basically, this is more focused on the decision. So, you know, there are stages to reflect your current stages now. So, proposal, site survey, permit approval, permission, operate, install inspection, then enclosed.
Agent: But these are still, again, very focused on that sale.
Agent: And so, if I move the stages to site survey, for example, it's still technically an open opportunity and you'll be able to see here under the forecast category and probability.
Agent: That now it's at [PERCENT-1] and as I move closer to closing it, it's going to just keep the numbers going to keep getting higher, but it's still not closed.
Agent: And so I have to actually go to close in order to to really mark this as a soul that way we're not just. We're not accounting for revenue that we don't actually have yet.
Agent: Or you know, because I know a lot of customers could potentially change their mind even before you go right before you go and install.
Agent: So that way you can kind of see where a lot of these deals got lost. And that way you can report off of that. Hey [PERSON-5].
EndUser: Thanks for joining in. What's going on guys. Yeah. Absolutely.
Agent: We're, I'm going to recap real quick just for the, for everyone since we've gone over a few things, but I'm also recap for you.
Agent: So, so let me know if you have any questions, but What we're seeing here is the ability to track our leads in [ORG-3] and then convert that lead into either a property or account. And also an opportunity.
Agent: And so we're in the opportunity stage right now where we're seeing all the details that pertain to the sales side. So the amount, what stage you guys are in, so again, before it actually closes.
Agent: And just in case the customer gets pulled feet, you can kind of keep track where that deal dropped.
Agent: And so this is before we're able to close it and I'm going to move on to the projects in a second, which is kind of what happens after.
Agent: So assuming that a customer signed off, But I wanted to ask, does this make sense?
Agent: Are you guys, when do you sort of recognize revenue?
Agent: Is it after the installed inspection?
Agent: Or is it when, you know, after the proposal is sent and they've approved it?
EndUser: Like at which stage do you guys write as you have installed?
EndUser: You said an install. Yeah, some companies do it a cruel base where as soon as they have a signed contract, that revenue.
Agent: They start counting
EndUser: But we don't until the customer can't cancel. And that's as soon as we sink
Agent: A bolt in the roof. That is all. Yep. Okay, that makes sense. So that was our thought process here, which is why we again, we kind of, these stages here are still considered in the forecast categories of pipeline.
Agent: So when we go look at the dashboard at the end here, you'll be able to see how that pipeline is being manipulated by me walking through the different stages and selecting the stage.
Agent: So this is just for a salesperson, the ability to walk through what's next, right, like, what do I need to accomplish before I need to meet, I move on.
Agent: The next one and what else do I need to capture when information . I also have tabs here where I can capture things like client roles.
Agent: So again, who's at the home?
Agent: Maybe I need to keep track of the housekeeper, the spouse, another contractor, you name it, but I have the ability to create client roles within the opportunity.
Agent: And then even an opportunity team, which is helpful if I'm working with somebody internally and my team that I need to give them access to so that they can also edit the information here.
Agent: And that's what you're seeing here. But [PERSON-17] are both working this deal.
Agent: I also have the ability to see quotes and products, which we won't go into too much detail since [PERSON-14]'s going to scope this out a little bit more to see how you guys approach this.
Agent: But at a high level, just keep in mind you can keep track of products and essentially edit the price on the go and create a quote. And we can look at a quote here in a second as well.
Agent: [PERSON-2], quick question. I want to give you a breather.
Agent: [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-5], are you guys managing or watching pipeline in any way [DATE-8]?
Agent: We didn't really get into that or forecasting.
EndUser: Is that rib somewhere else?
EndUser: Yeah, not currently. We're working on some kind of band aid for now, just for guys to, for sales guys to input leads into, but currently there's nothing. It's just everyone kind of on their own devices.
Agent: Got it. Okay.
Agent: Cause we're not showing any analytics right now, but you can probably put together the pieces like you see probably [PERCENT-1] here and I suspect as you start to go up for your investing, whether it's this angle around or in the future, able to manage that pipeline and see where the risk lies will become increasingly important, especially when you can't wrap your head around every single deal, which I suspect will happen soon.
Agent: Cool enough to raise your hand, man. You can just talk. All right.
Agent: All right. That was good. So one thing I wanted to bring up here as well, I mean, we're working with about five other solar companies currently.
Agent: They're all moving over to [ORG-3] and they're kind of falling like the same blooper in here for the most part.
Agent: One of the things that we haven't shown here [DATE-8] that might be of interest is like the notion of a canvassing application or also a door knocking app.
Agent: Are you guys using something in place of that here [DATE-8]?
EndUser: We were using sales rabbit, but we kind of moved away from that. And then there's another app that the banded that we were kind of talking about, [GPE-1].
EndUser: They have a pin dropping app, but I mean, it would be ideal to have it all in one spot.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: So what we've done here for these other companies is that you can go through and then you can, like, using a map and kind of build out these different territories, fill throughout the homes that you don't want to target or whatever that ends up being.
Agent: And then assign. Those territories or else the homes within those territories to the right reps and then go through and schedule that out whether it's just like a blanket territory or individual homes, whatever that is.
Agent: And then on their mobile device, they then get those notifications. They know who they're supposed to go knock a door or where this was going to knock a door disposition the result of that. And ideally book.
Agent: The closer to come back out there, you know, [DATE-9] after [DATE-10] doing the site survey or something to that extent, all within that app.
Agent: And then that also introduces some gamification to where we can show their position on the leaderboard.
Agent: Are they at the top, are they at the middle, And then you can run different incentives and or at the bottom?
EndUser: Things like that. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So a question that comes up, because you brought that up.
EndUser: In the pin dropping application that you guys use for other companies, is there a data grid?
EndUser: Like, it pulls up, if you click on a house, it pulls up their data.
Agent: Yeah, and so what we've seen here in the past is like the value of the home, you're the home was built.
Agent: I think there's some additional data points I can't remember here off top of my head, but oftentimes, hey, this was a brand new home built in [DATE-11]. you know, property values, you know, [MONEY-2], whatever that ends up being.
Agent: Good chance these guys can afford solar. So let's go and start and say, yeah, versus the house is built in like you know, it hasn't moved, uh, or something to that extent.
Agent: And the house value is like a little bit lesser. Maybe you don't want to go knock on that door because they're probably not going to invest kind of money.
Agent: So either way, yes, you do have the ability to go through and build these filters and then drill into house specific details to help inform like, how can we best deploy our team to go out there in the field and close the most business or else at least set as many appointments as
EndUser: Possible?
EndUser: Makes sense.
Agent: Yeah, yep. And so are you guys, are you doing the site survey yourselves or are you using a
EndUser: Third party for that?
EndUser: We're doing everything ourselves. Yeah, so
Agent: Site survey as well. Beautiful, love it. Yeah, and so what you can do from there, like our other client, they're wanting to.
Agent: Out of the door knocker, go out there and then schedule the closer to come out there right there with the customer so that we were not losing any momentum. That's another option here as well.
Agent: Or if you want to take it back to somebody internally for them to do the scheduling, can do the scheduling from within the application, get that closer to go out there on site.
Agent: And then another thing here too that I'm sure you guys have probably been confronted with is the drop off between signature and install date.
Agent: And we have different tools we can leverage your different communication channels that we can that we can utilize.
Agent: To make sure that we're decreasing those drop offs between those two key dates by staying in touch with the customer, keeping them apprised at the permitting, are we [ORG-10], what's the path to PTO?
Agent: And then that way ideally we increase the overall number of conversions after the sale before the installation.
EndUser: Yeah, that's awesome. Communication is huge and that's something we don't have implemented yet,
Agent: So that's good each other. Yeah, yeah, there's a variety of things that can be done on that front. I'm sure [PERSON-2] will kind of touch on this here, you know, at least a certain extent.
Agent: But oftentimes, you know, these are the problems we're seeing solar companies like yourself face.
Agent: And the good news is we have different tools at basically every stage or every phase of your cycle to help further your efforts to make sure that the efficiency is there.
Agent: And then on the other back end, we can report on all those different activities that are being performed in identified coaching areas or else, you know, identify the folks
EndUser: Who are top performers. Absolutely. I love that.
Agent: Awesome. I appreciate the context call. The insight. So I'll move on to the projects now, but again, I wanted to highlight the activity section.
Agent: Remember that I mentioned that you can pretty much email call text from anywhere within the app.
Agent: So really powerful stuff to just be able to do everything here and I have to leave your [PRODUCT-3] to go to your email if you want to just do it all in house here, you can.
Agent: And so the idea is that we would walk through these different stages again as we're talking to [PERSON-11] we're getting paper sign. We need to have any files uploaded here. We can also do that.
Agent: And so let's just say that we are at the install inspections stage. So we're ready to go. Everything, you know, it has been approved. [PERSON-11]'s good to go.
Agent: So we want to schedule that install so I can mark this at this current stage and in the background, what will happen is a project will automatically get created that'll carry over some of this information.
Agent: And I'm not going to show you how I did the automation. Is that something calls team would do, but it's very simple. I was able to do it without zero without any code.
Agent: And again, you because everything in [ORG-3] is interconnected. you can relate information back and forth or you can bring information from one place to another.
Agent: So automatically information will carry over, for example, from the lead record we brought in [PERSON-11]'s name and his address, and that's still carrying over all the way to the project.
Agent: So you can choose certain things that you want to bring over as you kind of go along the way and create new records. So again we're done with the opportunity record right sales is done with this piece.
Agent: I marked install inspection and now if I go into the projects tab, I'll see a project record there that I can click into.
Agent: Before I click into, again, I just want to remind you, I think you hadn't, you hadn't enjoyed the call yet before you saw this feature where we could schedule, you know, the time with [PERSON-11] by sending him, you know, of course an email from here, but I can also send him preferred times or scheduling link.
Agent: So I have the ability to select a few times. Here it's not let me do it because I'm sending it to myself. So let's see. So.
Agent: All right, I'm going to walk away from this, but it's because I was trying to send it earlier and it's now giving me an error. But basically, we're able to send those scheduling links like I said earlier.
Agent: And once we get that scheduled, we can move into the project record.
Agent: And so now I'm just going and I jumped from the account to the project, but I can also go again to this project tab and then from here find the project. Through that list view that I mentioned earlier.
Agent: So here now I have details about the project. So same sort of concept. We can have images, pictures, files, documents, all here. But then we also have the ability to track the different stages.
Agent: I don't know much about the solar industry or at least your particular process in each step. But I just used my previous experience and some things I've seen with other solar companies.
Agent: So typically the roof preparation is first then the installation, electrical and utility comes after. Thanks for watching ! etc.
Agent: So I just made them into stages again so that way you can track where all these projects are and we'll see how at the end the dashboards that we saw at the beginning of the demo, these are all manipulated by these different stages that we're selecting.
Agent: But under the stages, we also have individual tasks. So I know [PERSON-3] earlier mentioned. not being able to sort of assign someone something very quickly with their current tool.
Agent: So here under stages I could go into each one of the phases. Again, these are just the stages. We can use a term interchangeably phase or stage.
Agent: But here I'm able to click into the stage and then within that I have specific tasks that I could assign to someone.
Agent: So I could create a new task, and assign it to someone else, I could sign it to myself. But this could be a particular step.
Agent: If you want to get that granular, if you don't want to get that granular, it's totally OK. But so I've seen some of our customers essentially have a template for all the things that need to be completed.
Agent: And that way they just create the project. All the tasks get assigned automatically. And everything is up for them to select when they completed it.
Agent: Any questions?
EndUser: Any thoughts here?
EndUser: Can you go back to the properties tab really quick?
Agent: To
EndUser: The property stack?
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: You want me to go to this?
EndUser: Yeah, Right here.
Agent: On.
EndUser: Maybe it was an opportunity. So it's the part where they had the site survey stage.
Agent: The. Oh, yeah. It's one side. Here. So it was it's in the project. So here under details, I have the stages right here.
EndUser: Where were the first ones?
EndUser: It was an opportunity. It's the one with like site survey.
Agent: Oh, yeah, we put And you might be pushing the demo environment to the brink here, but.
Agent: That in the opportunity.
EndUser: So for each stage like permitting or site survey, is there a way to have multiple statuses within that stage?
Agent: Multiple statuses within Like sub statuses.
EndUser: That stage.
Agent: Yes. Sorry, [PRODUCT-1]. I saw you come
Agent: Up and you. Yeah, you're good. You're good. So yeah. So sub statuses basically like different milestones or different activities that need to be completed within the permitting phase within, um, you know, utilities or whatever you're needing to do.
Agent: Yeah, you definitely can. And then one other question I had for you guys as retains to your sales process. Are you using something like solo or open solar or also [GPE-2] everbright.
EndUser: Right now to handle that?
EndUser: We use
Agent: Everbright?
Agent: Okay, gotcha. Not as familiar with that one, but I'm assuming it's pulling in like the shade reports, shade zones, azimuth, like all
EndUser: That kind of stuff. Yes it is.
Agent: Awesome. Sorry, so let me but yeah, just curious about that.
Agent: And so yeah, ultimately, what I think the secret sauce is here for leveraging [ORG-3] effectively is going to be this notion that there's a lot of different elements here that have to be acquired in through each stage of the process and there's different people and there's these different handoffs that need to occur.
Agent: And so one of the questions you guys had here earlier is like, can we notify?
Agent: You know, [PERSON-19], when [PERSON-28] is done with his task and so therefore she'd be tapped in. Um, the question I'd have on that front would be.
Agent: Are you, are you having named people every time or is it one of those deals where you just go to like a queue of individuals who can do that job?
EndUser: As of right now, it's just one person like in the permitting department, but as we grow, like the permitting team as an example will grow.
EndUser: So it can either go to one or it can go to like the permitting team. Yeah, and the like the permitting manager assigns it or everyone just
Agent: Talk Exactly, and so what we typically see is like this notion of using cues Where you've got like the project management team for the Northwest the project management team for the [LOC-3] And then we assign it to that queue and it's either first come first serve They just grab it as it enters a queue or you have somebody who's managing it and actively assigning it to various individuals based on whatever their preferences
Agent: Okay, so with that, yeah, so with that comes the ability to automate it that says whenever, you know, [ORG-11] individual has completed their work, we're going to alert the property or sorry the project management team to then therefore turn the ball forward.
Agent: And then there's an automation that would go out to either everybody in that queue, or it'll go out to like the manager of that, that territory of that zone.
Agent: And then they're responsible for them going through and delegating to somebody else and like what's been assigned.
Agent: Any other time that an activity needs to be signed to like the project manager for that project, they're automatically getting notified versus like Right.
EndUser: The entire group all over again.
Agent: Great stuff. As you can see, my job is to sort of paint the high level picture and really the the general idea that [ORG-3] is just supposed to be the data capturing tool.
Agent: So it's where you put all your information in, how you do it, that's really up to you. And the little details in between and the steps or the additional sort of nuances or processes.
Agent: That's where [PRODUCT-1] comes in and he can recreate. some of those things within those [ORG-3] platform. So all these things that you've asked or mentioned so far, all of these we can do.
EndUser: I was having a hard time hearing
Agent: It on the sub-stages. Internet was a little slow. But once I heard it, I realized what you were asking. So the answer is yes, [PERSON-3]. We can create sub-sages.
Agent: And again, how we're doing this here doesn't necessarily reflect how you're going to do it in the end. This is just an idea. And I think [PRODUCT-1] has a lot more experience with being able to actually implement this.
Agent: So hopefully you're still seeing the vision here. of just being able to capture all the data in these particular records . and having everything in place for everyone to see with the right profiles and the right permissions.
Agent: And again, this is all accessible on mobile too. So that's the real idea here, is just try to keep everything in sales, for sure if you can. Um. And so that includes the projects.
Agent: And one other thing that I mentioned was the dashboards. So because we're entering all this information, now we're able to see that dashboard that I showed at the beginning.
Agent: And that's where the data, that's where you're getting all this beautiful data from. What you're seeing here is being pulled in from everything that I typed in, all the records that are being created, all the statuses.
Agent: So a lot of, for example, on the lead record, there was a status, a lead status. And that was just simply the stage.
Agent: Here you can see that's how we're able to kind of aggregate and see how many are in the new status versus, you know, contacted And the same thing This is the same case for pipeline.
Agent: So within the sales reports, I can actually drill in to the sales report . and see what's behind the scenes.
Agent: So what are the records that are showing here?
Agent: So let me pull up another dashboard here. All right, so this is more of a sales rep dashboard here. But again, we're able to see the closed business, pipeline, activities, and we can drill them into them if needed.
Agent: And then now we can see the actual records. And you could also edit the information here, just like you would in [PRODUCT-4]. That way you don't have to export into [PRODUCT-4] or manipulate it in another tool.
Agent: You could hit Edit and start messing with any of the fields that you have access to. You can add filters. So you can look at all opportunities, my opportunities from all time.
Agent: So it's very quickly to run a report. It's very easy to run a report. and pull in any piece of information, like you could pull in where the lead source came from.
Agent: You know, was it from door to door?
Agent: Was it from our website?
Agent: And then you can just hit run and start to see that information flow right away.
Agent: One additional question here too. There's going to be with regards to
Agent: Your scheduling for your installers.
Agent: And so what's that process look like [DATE-8]?
EndUser: What do Like a sign in cruise Yeah, I think that's not you mean?
Agent: Install?
Agent: Signing. No, so for signing crews. And so basically assuming that we're [ORG-10], we're ready to go. And let's say that we find a time for the client, for the customer here.
Agent: How are you determining who to actually use to go out there and install the panels?
EndUser: All operations manager does that. And he, he does it based on like the intensive intensity of the job.
EndUser: Like he's not going to give a crew two or three huge jobs back to back to back and give a smaller system to another crew where he tries to even it out.
EndUser: Like if one crew has a difficult big job, then [DATE-10], look at an easy one.
Agent: Sure, that makes sense.
Agent: What about, I mean, what tools are you using for that just like [PRODUCT-4] or something on those left?
EndUser: Probably just word of mouth. I don't think he actually puts a crew's name on Like picture capturing we use company cam and for another company, we use their site captured, but for our in-house, we use a install.
Agent: Company cam. Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. How many installers four man crews.
EndUser: Or how many crews you guys have right now?
EndUser: We're running three
Agent: I know. Okay.
Agent: And then what are you thinking in terms of how that might change in like [DATE-11]?
Agent: So I was going to double triple quadruple. There you go.
Agent: Cause what we also run into here too, like once you get started to scale, cause we worked with clients that have gone from [MONEY-3] in revenue to [MONEY-4] in revenue inside [DATE-10].
Agent: And so I'm sure you guys are probably on the same trajectory.
Agent: In terms of what you're looking to do and the problems that they ran into was, as you start to scale, finding the right crews who can handle these types of jobs.
Agent: Becomes a little bit more difficult in terms of like factory and drive time, in terms of factoring in the skill level that is required, factoring in like the pitch of the roof, factoring in all these additional things here to make sure that you're finding the right people for the right job in the most efficient way possible.
Agent: And what we've found is like, once you're using just like calendars or like [PRODUCT-4], that starts to break down, I'd like to [MONEY-5] two [MONEY-6] mark. Once you're seeing like 41 different crews. It's really difficult.
Agent: [ORG-3] has a scheduling engine, the dispatching engine that we can leverage here. And then we can also get away from company cam.
Agent: If I am correcting this, company cam makes it difficult to go through and group all of your photos by a given project. I think it just groups it by a person in [DATE-14].
Agent: And so if you're doing like two installs in [DATE-14], let's say, or if you want to go through an aggregate and do some QA, QC type work, it's fairly difficult to do that using a company cam You've got 28 different projects in [DATE-9].
EndUser: It does it based on address or like file the name. Like the homeowner's name, but a lot of times they'll be in the wrong Sure.
Agent: Homeowner.
EndUser: So,
Agent: Yeah. So basically what we've done here in the past is that we have a homeowner or property one, two, three, and then for that property, we are scheduling that appointment based on the client's availability.
Agent: And then from there, we need to find the right crew based on skill set, based on drive time, based on a variety of different factors.
Agent: And the system will automatically surface the appropriate crews based on the criteria that we have. And then they get that notification on their phone. They arrive on the job site.
Agent: They're guided through the process of like what photos they're needing to take. I'm assuming you guys are probably taking like 40 to 105 photos per project.
Agent: And then it'll automatically associate it with the what we call a work order inside a sales force.
Agent: And so everything is containerized and you don't really have the opportunity or the ability to associate photos with the wrong house because we're using geofencing. We're using geolocation data. It'd be really, really hard to screw
EndUser: That up basically. Right.
Agent: So there's a peek into, I don't know if it's necessary for right now.
Agent: Or if we need to like take a look at budding that off here in [DATE-11] But as you guys grow as you're looking to get to I don't know what your revenue is now But you know your 10x target Those are just some of the problems that we've seen other companies be faced with and just letting you know that we have solutions Inside of the platform that we can employ to solve for those problems when the time comes
Agent: [PERSON-1] yeah, it's been going to things cool I was going to,
Agent: I knew I'm coming up to the end of my demo here. The last thing I wanted to show, I know we talked about this maybe being a future state thing, but it is an easy lift on our end.
Agent: And I'm sure [PERSON-16] would agree. It's one of the things that we do more often is a portal. So I wanted to just give you a little bit of an idea what that looked like.
Agent: So again, remember that all this data that we typed into the [PRODUCT-3] is now inside of our [PRODUCT-3] and can now be exposed to any customer in any which way. One of those ways is through a portal.
Agent: And so I just tapped into this other tab here. And this is what your portal would look like. I kept it very simple. It's mainly just somewhere where the customer can go and see their open projects.
Agent: So if there's multiple, they have multiple homes and you know putting solar on multiple, they can not only see the properties here, they could see multiple properties. They could also see the project.
Agent: So they could see, for example, here, if I'm [PERSON-11] and I log into this project, I'll be able to see the same information that was seen here in [ORG-3] a second ago.
Agent: Now we can control again the level of information that we want to show them how we want to show them to if we want to make it a little bit prettier bigger fonts all that stuff.
Agent: This can all be configured with zero Code and it's all built into the [ORG-3] platform. All you would need is a license for the person that's logging in, but it is a. A smaller license.
Agent: It's not a full license that your customer would need and they would only need it to be able to see the data and interact. But they can also interact with you in comments or send you messages.
Agent: And one thing I have here as well that I was blocking with the faces. But here on the right-hand side, you also have the ability to put a chat bot or an SMS button or what's up, [ORG-11].
Agent: But basically, you have the ability to allow your customers to communicate through the portal with you, with the company.
Agent: So that way they don't have to go and go to your website and try to find a way to to get a hold of you.
Agent: Any thoughts, any is this in the right direction?
Agent: [PERSON-31], [PERSON-4], are we speaking the language that you were kind of hoping to hear or, you know, just let me know if there's anything missing or if we missed
EndUser: The mark.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm looking this along.
EndUser: I'm going to end up re-watching the Recording on the road, but I'm liking what I'm seeing.
Agent: Cool. Yeah, sorry, you missed the first piece, but we'll send you the Recording right after, and I think the rest of what I showed will make send after that. But [PERSON-3], are you going
EndUser: To say something?
EndUser: Yeah, so. Again, I may have mentioned on the first one, I'm huge on the [PERSON-30] board.
EndUser: And then also going back to the subsetuses is like if I click on permitting, can I see like the like in a can ban of the five or six different subsetuses of all the jobs in permitting.
Agent: So let me let me do the first one, which is the can ban, the [ORG-10], [ORG-10].
Agent: So here I'm going to the opportunities list to you, right?
Agent: And then from here, I have the ability to. Oh,
Agent: Sorry, I wasn't seeing the button for a second. So here under the display as I can see as a table, can ban or split view. So if I click. can bend here.
Agent: I just have to choose how I want to group them. And then you're going to see it this way. And so then I could quickly move these records from left to right, from the, through the different stages.
Agent: So this basically I could just leave the view this way. I just have it on default as table because I like to look at it that way instead. But yeah, absolutely.
Agent: You could switch to [ORG-10] view on any of these objects, so projects, opportunities, et cetera. And then again, you have the ability to group it however you want and have the columns show whatever information you want.
Agent: And then you can move them from one stage to another this way.
EndUser: Is this kind of what you're envisioning?
EndUser: Yeah, so there could be multiple, like if I click on site survey, it'll show ready for site survey, site survey scheduled. Like in progress and then review Yeah.
Agent: And complete.
EndUser: I
Agent: Yeah, I don't have the sub stages built out just because I wasn't expecting that one, but. But yes, it would have to be configured, but that's something cool can do.
EndUser: But absolutely cool.
EndUser: Go ahead, [PERSON-3].
EndUser: Sorry.
EndUser: I was done. You can go my way.
EndUser: I have a question going back to something we talked about So I know [PERSON-3] said it's kind of a priority of ours to have this automated and that's something that we're missing with [ORG-8].
Agent: Kind of in the beginning.
Agent: Our lacking with job
EndUser: So when you were talking about. Moving like or changing who's in charge of an opportunity. I know he used [PERSON-16] and example.
Agent: [PERSON-6] as our
EndUser: Is that something and you might have already answered this but is that something we could.
EndUser: Automate like with a flow like once it hits a stage it automatically does that So I know you showed us the manual side of that but to where it just is completely
Agent: Done like with a flow . Absolutely. Yeah, so I did a little bit of automation there with the whenever I changed the status to to closed.
EndUser: Opportunity
EndUser: Whenever I changed it
Agent: It automatically created, you know, the project record. So at the same time, I could also change the owner of the opportunity or the owner of [ORG-14].
EndUser: The project automatically.
Agent: So you can either do it with a flow. There's also other ways to do it inside a self-worth with code. So there's a lot of tools and calls very well-versed in creating some of that logic.
Agent: And we've seen it before. So yeah,
EndUser: Absolutely.
Agent: Perfect. Thank you. The thing to keep in mind is that it is scale.
Agent: Right?
Agent: And so when we're small or smaller, we can go through and assign it to like-named people. It always goes to [PERSON-21]. It always goes to [PERSON-28], like whatever that is. However, at scale, that becomes an issue.
Agent: And so when you're triple and quadruple and 10x your head count, we need to avoid assigning two named people within a flow and then create the more advanced logic that says, and he needs to go to a project manager, he needs to go to an electrician, he's to go to a roofer, he needs to go to somebody else.
Agent: And then we'll have a queue of folks that can be qualified for that particular type of a job. And then once it's been said at the project level, then that'll be kind of the default going forward. Bye.
Agent: Tense your question, I guess, in a longer way. Yes, it is possible. We can definitely go through and assign it to somebody automatically.
Agent: The question then just becomes, how do we build it so it can scale effectively with your business and then not break down when you have 10x the number of people that you currently do.
EndUser: That makes perfect sense. Thank you.
Agent: Awesome. Well, that kind of concludes the end. That concludes my demo here.
Agent: Did I miss anything?
Agent: Were there any questions?
Agent: I'm happy to take a second to ensure anything.
EndUser: I'm sure I'll think of something [TIME-3] but it looks pretty straightforward.
Agent: After we hop up the call,
Agent: [PERSON-1]. Hopefully that makes sense. Again, meant to just paint sort of like a preliminary vision.
Agent: And then when we go through that scoping call with [ORG-7] team, he's going to get more into the details of what you want to see in [ORG-3].
Agent: But as you can see within [TIME-4] [TIME-5], [TIME-6], I was able to just kind of put together and all in one place for your company to put all their customer information.
Agent: So with that, y'all hand it back to [PERSON-11] if there's no questions.
Agent: [PERSON-1]. Well, thank you [PERSON-2]. We appreciate the time. So I'm just gonna pull up for [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4]. I think [PERSON-5] jumped off, but next steps. here, so we can start to think about what's next.
Agent: So we just got through solutioning and demo. There'll be a little bit more to do as far as solutioning goes [DATE-13] with Implementation planning.
Agent: And I know we kind of talked about a end of [DATE-14] timeline for completely evaluation and then getting into implementation. So we're working towards that. We can move as fast or as slow as you need to.
Agent: But I think the next step right here we can talk about is finding time for this Implementation planning.
Agent: I think, [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], I don't know if you're on the chain or not, but I'm coming through [GPE-3] on [DATE-11]. So it'd be great to stop by and say hi, nothing else.
Agent: And maybe we could look at calendars for scheduling that call with [PERSON-31] as far as Implementation planning.
EndUser: Uh, yeah, I may be available. I may be out of town Now we're seeing some more fun.
Agent: [DATE-11]. Okay.
EndUser: No, we're our team doing a blitz in touch.
Agent: Be it's like
EndUser: [TIME-7]. Oh, yeah. I'm bigger soon and
Agent: I may be going up there with them. Oh, nice. That should be. Uh, okay.
Agent: Are you going to be?
Agent: It's going to be like an afternoon thing morning thing or we can look towards, most importantly, I want to get the at least a virtual call schedule with the right on folks.
EndUser: Um, I'll say don't know.
Agent: Oh, are you still?
Agent: Yeah, are you still in In the car.
EndUser: The car, [PERSON-3]?
Agent: Yeah, do you have like a, is it easy?
Agent: We can look at calendars right now and schedule the call with [PRODUCT-1] and [PERSON-6] while
EndUser: We're on the phone if that's easier. I just don't know what my plan is for [DATE-11] for
Agent: Going to the hot tree. No, we can look at. [DATE-16] to or [DATE-16] or if it's easier to take offline.
EndUser: That's that's fine too.
Agent: Um, yeah, can I just get back to you on availability?
Agent: Yeah No worries any Thoughts on next steps here do does it look like we're
EndUser: Lined up at least from a timeline perspective?
EndUser: Yeah, I may have missed it on the first couple calls or the first call with my entrend I have no idea how any of the pricing works
Agent: Like how much does this cost?
Agent: Oh, sure. Yeah, I went with I went through that with Trent one off. So there's the way it works is there's two separate pieces. There's a sales force piece. And then I think you were on the call.
Agent: It was so Recording now. Let me just take this off and we can talk.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1. ""So we're like, you're a soldier We need a new roof first.""
2. ""So we thought about those goals and we thought about the obstacles that might get in your way both that we talked about in our last conversation and that we've seen other folks run into.""
3. ""And typically there's three key areas where obstacles pop up. And the first one, [PERSON-3], just like you said, scalability.""
4. ""And the second is maintaining what we'll think of as like a brand or your customer centricity.""
5. ""And then the third category for key challenges that we're thinking about how to solve for is in the area of automation.""
6. ""So just to give you both kind of a preview of what [PERSON-2] will walk through [DATE-8], we're going to focus on sort of that phase one approach if you will.""
7. ""So we'll take you from the lead, wherever the source is. I put [PERSON-9] knock here, but it could be inbound through managing that opportunity through some of the project management capabilities.""
8. ""And then throughout, we'll speak on reporting and analytics. And I'll also adhere, [PERSON-2] put together a great demo. But we did make this into enough business days.""
9. ""So [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], if you see something, you're like, that's not exactly how we were thinking of this, or we're envisioning something else. Let's talk about it.""
10. ""We have all the folks on the phone here to have a productive conversation. Ultimately, this is your time.""
11. ""So [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], at a high level, do we capture the goals? Or did we miss anything that you feel like should be categorically in there?""
12. ""Any any questions, [PERSON-3]? [PERSON-4]? [PERSON-5]? [PERSON-6]? [PERSON-7]? [PERSON-8]?""
13. ""So if I'm a sales person here and I log into the sales app, that's all I can see, right?""
14. ""So I now have the ability to see everything relating to sales. Pipeline, activities, tie back to sales, phone calls made. forecast, top accounts. And again, the same applies two for all the other apps.""
15. ""So basically you're able to have a different point of view, depending on who's logged in and what profile they have.""
16. ""And you can also limit what each person sees or what they're able to control, whether it's edit rights or just being able to read You have a lot of flexibility there with [ORG-3] to be with . Create the hierarchy that you need two for your users.""
17. ""So if I if it's too simple, you know, let me know, but I do want to make sure that I don't overwhelm.""
18. ""Because there's a lot to see here on the screen. But very simply so far what we've done is we've just looked at a lead record.""
19. ""And what's cool about this is if I need to communicate with [PERSON-11], let's say I gather all the information for [PERSON-11], even some files that you can see here.""
20. ""I have the ability to upload files, maybe I took some pictures of the home.""
21. ""As I'm communicating with him, if I leave and I need to reach back out via email or via phone call, I have the ability to log that activity here.""
22. ""So let me move this up here.""
23. ""So when I click on the email, I could now see this window pop up.""
24. ""And so I can actually type in an email from here.""
25. ""And again, because it's connected to my email on the back end, I can send them an email. It's going to look like it's coming just for me from my email address.""
26. ""So you really have the ability to type in your email, but you also have the ability to use templates, which is really the magic here.""
27. ""Because we have all this information already in. Inside of our",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and goals, and tailoring the demo to address those needs. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current sales process and tools, particularly with regards to handling leads and managing pipeline. The customer mentioned that they don't currently have a way to manage pipeline or forecasting, which could be a potential area of need.
2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current process for scheduling installations and assigning crews. The customer mentioned that they currently use word of mouth and calendars to schedule installations, which could be a potential area of need.
3. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's growth plans and how they plan to scale their business. The customer mentioned that they want to grow and become a national brand, which could be a potential area of need.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and tailoring the demo to address those needs. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs and potential areas of need.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer did seem to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They expressed interest in the product's features and asked several questions to understand how it could be customized to fit their specific use case. They also mentioned that they liked what they were seeing and would re-watch the recording to understand it better. However, they did not explicitly state that the product meets all their needs. Therefore, it can be inferred that the customer is positively inclined towards the product but a definite confirmation is not provided in the transcript.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the correct decision maker was on the call or to specify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The sales representative mentions finding time for an implementation planning call, but it is unclear if this was agreed upon by the customer.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""Does this make sense? Are you guys, when do you sort of recognize revenue?"" The customer seemed more engaged as they provided a specific detail about their revenue recognition process, indicating that they were actively considering how the sales rep's solution could fit into their existing operations.
2. ""Are you using something like solo or open solar or also [GPE-2] everbright to handle that?"" The customer's engagement increased as they provided specific information about the tools they are currently using, showing that they were interested in finding a better solution.
3. ""How many installers or how many crews you guys have right now?"" The customer's engagement was heightened as they provided specific details about their current operations, indicating that they were considering how the sales rep's solution could scale with their growth."

Agent: There we go. I'm beautiful.
Agent: So once again, like what is our philosophy behind leveraging a [PRODUCT-1]?
Agent: Well, in an ideal world here, we're giving the people who are needing to do their jobs, the ability to work within a single platform as much as possible to do their jobs, you know, to do what is being asked of them.
Agent: We know as routines too, we've got their sales team, you got your operations team, we got these orders that we're getting to fulfill, we have your call center folks, so we have a lot of different individuals, these personas as we've defined here in a previous slide.
Agent: We got these different personas like, here's who were trying to build a resulting system landscape model for.
Agent: Maybe a few other ones you were adding or something to that extent, but where do we envision those folks working?
Agent: Well. Once again, we're biased, I'm biased, but we envision those folks working inside of [ORG-1] day in and day out.
Agent: So whether you're doing your operating in sales capacity, you're operating in the fulfillment capacity, operations capacity, call center capacity, etc. with, you know, it's left me being integrated there too.
Agent: Ideally, they can all work in a single unified platform to carry out their various tasks and processes.
Agent: And then for folks who are needing to live in another system, then we make sure that we can send that information downstream, or if we need to get information from the system, we can then pull it back into our single unified platform, [ORG-2].
Agent: So this is what we had put forth as a potential option from a system landscape model perspective that would allow for the functional work that is needing to be done.
Agent: To be done in a single platform with the ramifications of that work being cascaded to these other point solutions here that we need to rely on.
Agent: So, [ORG-3], best in class from a ERP standpoint, don't envision that going away, but we want to be able to carry out closing out an agreement here with a client, getting an initial order put together for the number of units we're needing to ship to a particular dealership, and then be able to send that information automatically into [ORG-3] here from a billing perspective or else at least planning the seat or also setting the statement.
Agent: For it . when those invoices are paid or when we're needing to actually recognize the transaction of some sort.
Agent: I did that and then funnel from our system into [ORG-4] or else vice versa, whatever we feel like is most beneficial.
Agent: Either way, what we're outlining here is a model to where [ORG-1] is the hub and these other point solutions are going to be the spokes. And then we're unifying them, we're integrating them through middleware.
Agent: And in this particular scenario here, it's [NORP-1] any point as our [ORG-5] connections through to funnel all th e virus from passing a data that .
Agent: Manager or air handling, additional documentation for decreasing our technical debt, all these different elements here. That is kind of the initial vision that we painted.
Agent: And then talking with the rest of the team, it was very clear that we needed to get you all and involved in these discussions, kind of discuss the utility of that and see if there would be any potential issues or else any concerns here that we need to address.
Agent: And I know that this is a lot to kind of take in here and I believe that deck was shared previously. If not, we can share it here again.
Speaker 4: And once again, this is just kind of like a working model, but. For those who maybe don't have access to that more than happy to go through and share it after the call. Hey, cool.
Speaker 4: I'm [PERSON-1] and the director of application development. I guess a question I have or someone like thinking about is with the hub and spoke model sales forces the source of truth. So in some cases we have to build.
Speaker 4: I guess two way updates right so we have an icon we have mobile apps we have.
Agent: App
Speaker 4: Data teams that have integrations for different stuff.
Agent: Like a lot of
Speaker 4: The DMS pen Integration stuff probably, as right now would flow actually through icons backend, and then icon would then update it to [ORG-1]. If we do it that way.
Speaker 4: So it's changes happen because there's going to be some changes that are happening from outside you have a very custom integration.
Agent: Third party systems that
Speaker 4: That we have to build out. Obviously you could build those in [ORG-1]. I think as far as I understand anything's possible in [ORG-1], if you got enough [ORG-1] engineers, it's gonna help him with it.
Speaker 4: But yeah, so think about, I guess you have a two-way update. So if somebody makes a change in [ORG-1], we need to also reflect in the icon apps.
Speaker 4: If icon, something comes in through some third-party Integration want to offer, customer goes into our app there and punches in a change.
Agent: Or
Speaker 4: That needs to reflect back.
Agent: So you got to build kind of a two-way sync there.
Agent: What's the, what's being used to kind of do that sync or is that a custom integration?
Agent: Great point, great point, great question. So... Ideally, we can leverage [NORP-1] as our middleware. That is the engine through which everything passes through.
Agent: So whenever you're going through and you're creating another integration, you got another [ORG-6] you haven't integrated with before. Ideally, we can get into [NORP-1] or middleware. And then we can build out that Integration with the other [ORG-6].
Agent: Now, the benefit here is that once we built it, we can reuse it. If you see it, we've got another customer house or something to that extent.
Agent: So we go through and we can build that Integration with the [ORG-6] or your icon platform, whatever that needs to be, and then just grab the information and indicate where that needs to be sent over to [ORG-1] to [ORG-3], like wherever that is needing to go, as opposed to creating these integrations with inside a [ORG-1], we're doing it inside of [NORP-1], and that's going to be
Speaker 4: The engine to which all these different connections are passing through.
Agent: Gotcha. Okay, so you got to build them all in middle soft there is meal soft an additional cost in addition to [ORG-1]. It is it is yeah so it's a separate platform
Speaker 4: From [ORG-1] on to the [ORG-1] umbrella.
Agent: But it is its own. Individual there's a year equivalent or something like that. Yeah, yeah, so [PERSON-2] is one of those options here point and click kind of a thing very same notion here within set of meal soft.
Agent: I would say I got in trouble for using this here in the past and apologies to anybody who. Let's say [PERSON-3], will whereas meal soft is more of like a extent, meaning
Speaker 4: Let's say it's a day
Speaker 4: [ORG-7] of [PRODUCT-2] or something to that it's more of an Enterprise solution it from a middleware perspective [PERSON-2] does something very severe. No code. No code.
Speaker 5: Yeah. And, and [PERSON-1], just so you know, uh, or maybe you do know, sorry, [ORG-1] acquired [NORP-1] back in [DATE-1] or [DATE-2]. And it's then been folded under the portfolio.
Speaker 5: And there's a bunch of interconnectivity and all that good stuff that we added, [PRODUCT-3] of all up, who's our sort of [NORP-1] specialist that they call as well.
Speaker 5: And if there's anything you want to add to [ORG-8], brilliant example, uh, please do.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I was going to ask also, those typically done through an event driven architecture or is it more of a push poll type system.
Agent: We can accommodate all the above and I don't want to speak here for banner still as thunder, but we do pub sub, we do event driven, we can do trigger based there's a variety of different.
Agent: Ways or mechanisms that we can integrate different applications.
Agent: I think you hit it on the head, [PRODUCT-4]. The main difference is you really don't have limitations.
Agent: When you're using a [NORP-1] versus like a Zapier, [PERSON-2] is great if you've got a couple of cloud-based applications you need to connect. Don't really need much special really out of the box in that sense.
Agent: But when you're talking about number one working with you, they're [NORP-2] messes or any sort of legacy system and really need a way to protect. Integration is happening with external.
Agent: For [NORP-1] starts to just really shows those Enterprise differences.
Agent: And then if we were talking about integrating two systems, my next question would be like, do you have anything on the future roadmap?
Agent: Because if you don't, then hey, [NORP-1] is overkill for you. You're just going to have one Integration to build and maintain.
Agent: [NORP-3] is there to make it easier so that way anything you build automatically goes into a visibility and error handling pain into [PRODUCT-4]'s point. I came from working at [ORG-9].
Agent: So I know dealers run pretty common buckets of DMSs, whether it's like dealer tracks, [ORG-10] or [ORG-11] solutions.
Agent: So once you build that first Integration to say dealer track, it's more than just a copy pace of a Code when it comes to reuse with [NORP-1], you can grab the entire Integration or down to the API spec.
Agent: That way it's a true repeatable process that's able to be tested as you deployed. And so you're maintaining that [ORG-14] between your external internal integrations while really speeding up the customer onboarding.
Agent: And ideally kind of like flattening the curve for how much maintenance you're having to do over time.
Agent: Because it's all going into a single pane and because, hey, if I do have a change or I make an enhancement to my product, that I'm going to be pushing out to these [ORG-10] DMSs, I can just worry about upgrading or updating that in one place.
Agent: And then I could roll that out to the, to all my existing connections or maybe all the existing connections for [ORG-10] track, they make a change and I need to make an adjustment and apply that across my customer base and [ORG-10] track.
Agent: For things along those lines are really like the scalability differences. [GPE-1] would make more sense than some legacy here. Gotcha.
Agent: And then I guess with like [ORG-6] or pen Integration is going straight to sales force, right?
Agent: So we've had a lot of cases where we do like quite a bit of like clean up and post processing because we have some integrations.
Agent: Maybe this one's not a DMS one, but right?
Agent: It's like an API we integrate with that does web scraping.
Agent: Of dealer websites, ones that either they use a small [ORG-6], it's not worth building an Integration with, or they just don't, you know, they don't want to pay for the Integration because sometimes they have to pay to unlock it.
Agent: In those cases, we get sometimes bad data that comes in.
Agent: And so we have a bunch of like protocols and things we implement in place to be like, oh, if like the engine field is over like 74 characters, that's probably wrong, or it flags certain things that'll see along the way.
Agent: And then we kind of review those things before we... You will be able t o appear in the next couple o f minutes . that dealerships like inventory records.
Agent: Does that something you would do inside a mule soft, inside a sales force?
Agent: Or does that even seem like the right use case kind of there for customer-based error handling and provisioning?
Agent: I'll let [PRODUCT-4] speak to the options he may have the sales force side. I feel like there are probably multiple ways you can go about it, but at least from a [NORP-1] perspective.
Agent: You can either put in a choice router or put in basically like a logic like you're looking for to maybe route this one way or another.
Agent: You can also customize an error handling aspect at the end of a flow if you want that to specifically notify somebody or want that to.
Speaker 4: Run a different calculation. You've got [QUANTITY-1] of customization in terms of what you do along with future case. We want to build an [PRODUCT-5] model that does error detection on our data. Right.
Speaker 4: Where we find that in some of that, you know, another application that's doing that error detection and then come back with the result, you can even do that. Yeah.
Speaker 4: So it's kind of up to you, rewind, a little more logic.
Speaker 4: So that's where I'm trying to figure out if the DMS pen Integration makes sense to go straight to [ORG-1], if that comes into icons back and we put process and then just sync it over to [ORG-1].
Agent: Sure. I mean, and there's nothing that would prevent you from using mule stops to be the layer between [ORG-6] and icon.
Agent: So if you're building out the Integration with all these different DMSs and you know once again the benefit here is that if we have dealer tracks spun up for dealership 119.
Agent: And that works whether we wanted to we have dealership [ORG-17] means go and we can repurpose we can replicate that Integration for dealer 105 for dealer [ORG-17] in [TIME-1].
Agent: Then to go through and like copy a bunch of Code and do all these different things that I'm assuming you're doing if you're doing individual point solution so.
Agent: What you could theoretically look to do is that you could leverage [NORP-1] to be the Integration layer between icon in your [ORG-6] systems and then do your additional logic inside of icon and then also use [NORP-1] to integrate icon with [ORG-1].
Agent: So once it passes like a certain threshold or criteria has been met to then indicate that the data has been cleaned up, then you can send it from icon into [ORG-1] but also still leveraging that same middleware application to be the bridge between DMSs and icon here as well.
Agent: With a notion that we're going to be reducing the time it takes to go through and spin ou t these integrations with all these different dealers across the country that you're bringing o n because as [PERSON-4] had mentioned there's not 4,000 different DMSs that you're probably going to se e is probably going to be like a much smaller group and once we've built out 34 of the m it should be a lot easier to go through and like spin somebody up because you kind of already hav e it in a can .
Agent: To kind of go back to your original question.
Agent: Is that something we could do with inside of mule sup?
Agent: Maybe you know, like typically we look at transformational orchestration.
Agent: So transformation of data, if it's coming in with one data model, we're wanting to like transform it to meet a different type of data model, or we need to grab your initial call and then re-judgment another system to get supplemental information based on that initial payload, and then basically like build another model from a combination of those two data points, and then send that along here to another application.
Agent: That could also be done here as well. So we typically have transformation, we have orchestration, providing those two two two make sure that data is coming from the right place or places to the right end point .
Agent: But if you're doing a lot of additional conditional logic, that might be better fit for icon, there's nothing that says that we can't send a two icon.
Agent: And then once criteria is met, then also flag it to be sent into [ORG-1].
Speaker 4: So we can take a couple of different approaches there if necessary. Gotcha.
Speaker 4: So it sounds like you could do a direct [ORG-14] if it was you're going to do more middlewares and things, then maybe you would go [ORG-16].
Agent: Pretty straightforward. If
Speaker 4: You could use [NORP-1] to go to icon or icon can build that correct connection
Agent: Directly and then use [NORP-1] to go from icon to [ORG-1].
Agent: Yeah Yeah, because the biggest problems I'm sure [PERSON-4] can speak of this here to in terms of what he saw at [ORG-9] is like If you got it if we have a client and they're integrating with three different systems Let's say two or three different systems Then, you know, building out the Integration directly inside of [ORG-1] is fine.
Agent: And there's typically like maybe four two six looking right in the neck of the woods where we kind of get like a little bit, you know, if you're not trying to build direct integrations with [ORG-1].
Agent: Because what we run into is collisions as you might have seen here in the past. We run into low locking errors all trying to affect the same record potentially.
Speaker 4: In terms of like multiple integrations,
Agent: There's just a couple of different things here that we would run into that we want to avoid. The orchestration aspect of [NORP-1] really helps us avoid that because it funnels. And it's Enterprise service bus.
Agent: So it follows everything through from these different end points that we're connected to, funnels it through here in a way that can be routed intelligently to make sure that we're not hammering the system with a bunch of different calls that might be causing errors.
Agent: You can phone them all through one system, intelligently handle the routing of the system. whatever it is we need to do, we can harmonize the data, etc.
Agent: So that's kind of where we look to using that [DATE-3] flight applications to run all of our integrations through and then let it figure out the best path to update sending the information to.
Speaker 4: Whatever system we're Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. And then I guess what are some ways here, I'm trying to figure out, if we use [ORG-1] for kind of becoming the source of truth in a lot of cases here.
Speaker 4: There's some UIs that we're going to have to build, you know, ideally like, like you said before, everyone's working in [ORG-1]. And so it's like, oh, we have one UI. This is like one place where everybody comes.
Speaker 4: But we do have dealerships we support where access.
Agent: We can't give them [ORG-1] Can we?
Speaker 4: Or is there a way for them to administer their vehicles where they would use. Salesforce because [DATE-4] we were going to design and build those all. Yeah.
Speaker 4: And like an icon back end app, like the dealer portal And then they would use that to manage or do different things because there's times Integration or doesn't get captured properly use the [ORG-17] software that sure they should be using.
Agent: Type thing. their inventory where there's no [ORG-6] or they don't
Speaker 4: So they're going to manually punch that in somewhere that transaction and create that custom provision that customer account.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: So how do you duplicate doing that work kind of twice and building it out in [ORG-1] and building it out in [ORG-10]?
EndUser: Yeah, before you guys are going to want to, the goal is not to replace Toolbox for Ice. We still want to do like the product strategy that we're having in place. We want to continue to do.
Speaker 4: It's just where does that data come from?
Speaker 4: I think it's my question.
Speaker 4: Is it going to come from [ORG-1]?
Speaker 4: Is it going to come from their platform
EndUser: That you guys are building?
EndUser: I don't know if that changes your question at all. Yeah, so I guess then this would replace tuner though or you know the tuner features that we're going to put into tool. Yeah, we were
Speaker 4: We were putting tuner features. Yeah in the toolbox. I It's just what drives it is.
EndUser: Think we could still do that.
Speaker 4: I guess it I guess what to figure out.
EndUser: Says make. Yeah, it make sense to even put them in there if they're already using the teams already using [ORG-1] to administrate some things.
Speaker 4: Does
EndUser: Do they just ministry at all things for I can't employees at least?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, If we did put functionality in [ORG-1], we wouldn't really be able to avoid using, having our people still have to go to toolbox to do the map, all this stuff, but they could go in and manipulate the data in [ORG-1], like vehicles, customers, all that stuff.
Speaker 4: Use two different platforms.
EndUser: They But yeah, there's functionality that we're gonna offer that we wouldn't be putting in [ORG-1].
Speaker 4: So they still have to use two apps then.
Speaker 4: I'm trying to think, because called we kind of had when we were brainstorming that the [PRODUCT-1] is just kind of the entry point into the system and icon Back then and because we use that [DATE-4], our we use [FAC-1] and it's our launch process essentially.
Agent: There was one idea this initially, it was
Agent: Was kind of the hub and spoke.
Speaker 4: And then the really the only thing we ever come back to it for management is like really, like for ticket management, so like customer as the we ping Twilio and then there's like a ticket that gets created, basically trying to keep the
Agent: An issue, like but we're [PRODUCT-1] in the loop [DATE-4], but the [PRODUCT-1] doesn't really like keep us in the loop as much. Yeah, exactly. That makes sense.
Agent: And so the thing is [ORG-1], and we can always accommodate that approach that that's what we all collectively decide is most logical and is going to give you guys the most utility.
Agent: Now, oftentimes what we find when clients are taking that approach here is that they need the flexibility to do what they want, how they want to do it, and other systems that they've tried in the past, [FAC-1], Sugar, [ORG-14], you know, just to give some examples, they just don't have the robust customization capabilities to allow for those companies to do what they want to do.
Agent: So they go custom, right?
Agent: They build on AWS, they build on SQL, whatever they do, because they just want to have complete control. with Inside of Salesforce. That isn't the case.
Agent: No, it does require a skill set to go through and build all those things here inside of the system, but it is an option should we decide to explore that.
Agent: And the tools that we have inside of [ORG-1] in terms of point and click, in terms of the things that we can do without having to write code, still having the ability to write some Code here, whether it's [PRODUCT-6] or [GPE-2].
Agent: We still can do so to expand on the customization capabilities.
Agent: But oftentimes what we're finding is that the ability to go through and build custom solutions, that custom interfaces, whatever you want to accomplish her e in the context of doing business can be don e a heck of a lot faster with [ORG-1] And that's oftentimes I get a lot of the benefit s of these clients .
Agent: Glean or else that they can realize is that man, I can still do the same things I was doing in my custom application. I can just do it faster now.
Agent: And the overall UI and the aesthetics are typically an improvement, not saying anything about the eye content, but rather than the clients we've had, like that is typically like an improvement. So that's one thought.
Agent: The other thing here, kind of going back to this notion of the dealerships.
Agent: We have clients in the telecommunication space where they have a bunch of franchises that are selling their sim cars their car their mobile phones and all this kind of stuff all over the globe.
Agent: So I think they have 2 million.
Agent: Customers vendors, etc, who are using.
Agent: What is called [PRODUCT-7], which is basically a portal that is built on top of the [ORG-1] database to interact and engage in the limited capacity based on the profile that is assigned to those customers.
Agent: The benefit here is it's all pulling from the same underlying database, record changes and whatnot is instantaneously going to be reflected within the portal experience that those customers have.
Agent: In our scenario here, there is a world, if we wanted to explore it, where we could build a portal on top of [ORG-1], leveraging the underlying [ORG-1] objects, the records that we have, and then [ORG-20] and sharing controls that [ORG-1] brings the table to allow for those dealership s to log in and carry out whatever sort of tasks we're wanting them to be able to carry out all pulling from the same underlying database inside the [PRODUCT-1] They can also then be cascaded over to icon They can be cascaded over to, you know , or whatever it is we're needing to do to provide once again a more efficient manner of allowing for your customers to engage with you of referencing and potentially like modifying or creating new records in the same underlying database are working through.
Speaker 4: That the rest of your users Gotcha, that makes sense. So I guess with enough, if we had a developer too that they could build some of these UIs, I guess, embed some different things.
Agent: Was a [ORG-1] developer,
Speaker 4: What's the capabilities, I guess, as far as UIs go?
Speaker 4: Because like [PERSON-5] was mentioning, we have these map views, which seem to be pretty important for some things like locating vehicles.
Agent: Can we embed Google Maps or [PRODUCT-8] or some of these like inside of [ORG-1] in certain views?
Agent: It's all again, it's all again. Yeah. So there's native recipes that you can leverage here in a mapping context that just uses [ORG-20].
Agent: And so provided that you have the geolocation data, we can go through and we can plot all the different. All these different addresses or geolocation records on a map with context and things around that.
Agent: People wanted to go further into that. [ORG-1] has its own application called [PRODUCT-9], which does it help a lot more than just plotting points on a map.
Agent: We can create these different polygons and these different territories, and we can do all these different things whether we do mass actions. So whatever your mapping requirements are, the answer to your question is yes.
Agent: We have a tremendous amount of options as it routines to building out a custom UI or custom process flow
Speaker 4: Feature set or custom that would incorporate geolocation or also mapping functionality. Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. One of the other things, [PERSON-5] and I, we've on [DATE-4], our launch process.
Agent: Been talking going back and forth
Speaker 4: That's like one of our biggest needs for our CRM [DATE-4]. They have kind of a, I think it's called [FAC-1] creator and specifically which then triggers like some other forms.
Agent: Fill up this giant form,
Speaker 4: But it's pretty, pretty simple. There's not a lot to Um, but we've been talking with some different companies like, uh, I don't or make things, make.com.
Agent: It [DATE-4].
Agent: Know if you're familiar with [PERSON-6] Um, Workflow orchestrators.
Speaker 4: But they're basically like these Um, our business, uh, business workflow.
Speaker 4: Decision trees and things you can build And then they tie into different hooks for like forms and different things to aggregate data And so you could say, yeah, like once this form is completed, you know person hits, you know, submit that then triggers these processes to kick off And especially for like the launch process, we have a lot of manual things that need to happen like looking airline tickets and travel for account managers to go out on site to like launch that dealership .
Speaker 4: I'm trying to figure out that that's something that makes more sense to build.
Agent: If we would go with [ORG-1]
Speaker 4: To launch [ORG-1] has tooling to do all that, or it would be better to integrate with some like [ORG-26] and then [ORG-26] would do that launch
Agent: Process into this use [NORP-1] to put that data into [ORG-1]. Sure.
Agent: Now, we of course want to be able to go through and dive potentially a little bit deeper into what that would consist of, but [ORG-1] has a very, very robust business logic in automation engine.
Agent: It's just called Salesforce Flows. And so very similar here in terms like what you're seeing, which is very much point and click. Now, this point and click can be augmented by code.
Agent: And so me personally, like I'm a developer. And so I within our own [ORG-1] environment, there's a mashup between what you can do and point and click.
Agent: And then you can then pull in custom programmatic classes that you built.
Agent: Screen elements that you've built here using [LAW-1] or you can create them using a point-and-click feature But no matter what, when it comes to an ability to say listen, I've got a process flow it's got a lot of different things We have some conditionality built in here I have to check this and verify that before moving forward and I want to have maybe some UI elements to it wit h some back-end automation and what maybe calls ou t an Integration or something to that extent Flow can definitely handle that The benefit here, we've bee n discussing is that these are all underlying [ORG-1] product s. And so, Flows, as they've been buil t, have been built with a notion of being able to tie in to these other products here as [PERSON-7] So, when we're talking about like event-driven architectur e, platform events inside of [ORG-23] e, we can create those using [PRODUCT-10] ws and that can then be picked up by [FAC-2] to then do something with [PERSON-8] And then vice versa, [NORP-1] can publish events to [ORG-23] e, we'll then trigger some sort of other automation here as [PERSON-7] So, the need to go throu gh with make or komodo, or whatever that was, I wouldn't imagine that you would need to do that considering all the pow er.
Speaker 4: I wouldn't envision
Agent: That we have from a business automation standpoint at our fingertips
Speaker 4: When we combine flows with mule soft.
Agent: I wouldn't envision like the
Speaker 4: Need for that. Yeah, that's what it looks like here. You got decision trees, you can do things in parallel, things in cereal. And then can trigger that, hey, send an alert to [PERSON-9].
Speaker 4: [PERSON-9] needs to go fill up this form information from the dealer.
Agent: And go gather this
Speaker 4: Type it in here, hit submit. The unblock is part of the flow. If he doesn't do it within [DATE-5], email his manager, the special, just, okay.
Agent: You know. Because of Yeah, there's time delays that we can put on things, say in after [DATE-5] do this, and you know, within [DATE-6] do that, et cetera. So yeah, there hasn't been a scenario.
Agent: That I've come across and I've been doing this for [DATE-7].
Agent: There hasn't been a scenario that I've come across where it's like, oh, you know what?
Agent: We needed another tool for that. [ORG-1], so many [ORG-29] typically, if we needed another tool, that other tools typically you'll saw. So I haven't seen a scenario to where those two combined can't solve for a business need.
Agent: And so I wouldn't imagine there being a scenario to where we would need something besides what sales force and the products we were looking at would bring the taste.
Speaker 4: Sure. No, it makes a lot of sense. Yeah, it looks robust enough. We got a pretty simple use case for that launch process.
Agent: So it should was taking some more below.
Speaker 4: Be fine. I
Agent: But yeah, so that's kind of what we had in mind here on our side is that. Whatever those needs are. From a process flow standpoint, we have the underlying capability to handle those.
Agent: And if it now is a matter of exposing this data to third party individuals, [ORG-1] does have an option once again, from a portal perspective to allow for that to be built on the [ORG-1] platform, allowing for us to once again, user, custom UI and [PRODUCT-11] components and the options that we have, kind of building unique experiences for customers based on whatever those use cases entail.
Speaker 6: I had a technical question, but more by the way, my name is such in I'm a consultant actually to icon helping in this process, not only just on the technology side, but more people process side as well.
Speaker 6: I had a chance to go through this kind of deck [TIME-2]. The piece I wasn't quite clear on is, what are the components in the proposal and the cost and all that that's listed in the back.
Speaker 6: Like what's and what's out, right?
Agent: In
Speaker 6: So like [ORG-34] is not part of that,
Agent: But I don't know if flow is or isn't or what getting information is or isn't or what have you.
Agent: So can you just clarify that a little bit?
Agent: Yeah, so basically everything that we've been talking about here thus far from a rough order magnitude standpoint would be included in that. Now there are some assumptions on our side that you guys have a development team.
Agent: So let's say for the Integration between [ORG-14] and icon that there would be some work that would be taken on by icon with the idea and the notion that there's probably some things that you want to own with our team having to own the other elements are more [ORG-1] specific such as maybe the Integration between icon and [ORG-1] integration.
Agent: You know, with marketing cloud.
Agent: Account engagement, email marketing, that sort of thing your end sales force, [PRODUCT-14], and then Five-Nine we typically see that here quite a bit as well So there's assumptions that are being mad e as it pertains to the solutions that we've presented this landscape model that we're reviewing here [DATE-4] and then the rough numbers we've given her e from a pricing and from a licensing standpoint The everything we talked about her e is in scope from a vision perspective There are just some, what's in some assumption s that we're making on our [PERSON-10] e around who's going to be doing what work, division of work perspective.
Agent: Once again, my assumption is that there are some things th at [ORG-25] is going to want to own.
Speaker 6: There's some things that we're going to have to take on just becau se of our experience and expertise with [PERSON-11] So, okay, just to clarify, so is [NORP-1], because I thought I heard that [NORP-1] is a different kind of, it's not part of, I
Speaker 5: Guess, this proposal different, but you're saying, I just want to make sure it is [NORP-1] part of the proposal or not?
Agent: To be something
Speaker 5: Yeah, We can take that session.
Speaker 6: I believe, yeah.
Speaker 5: We provided [PERSON-5] the team sort of a low estimate and a high estimate of the software. The high estimate is inclusive [GPE-3] in the offering.
Speaker 6: Of If you want [GPE-3] to be the conduit of all these little lighting bolts that you see on the screen. Gotcha. That is inclusive. Yeah. That's all.
Speaker 6: And then second, maybe it's in one of the appendix pages that I didn't see, but like I think, as [PERSON-14] mentioned, some of the assumptions that are.
Speaker 6: But that you guys might have made in putting this proposal together in terms of what icon might mean, whether to maintain it or what have you.
Agent: It's [ORG-1] developers
Speaker 6: And we get, I don't know if it's there, but that'd be really useful just right. So on our side, we can get a better
Agent: Sense of what to expect from, you know, you bought that kind of deployment and then an ongoing maintenance standpoint as well. Totally, totally. Yeah, exactly. So.
Agent: The next step here from our perspective, you're going to give you an idea of our thought processes. We had a lot of conversations with the icon team.
Agent: We had a lot of states here in [PERSON-10] and [ORG-1], and we're like, hey, we have a plan.
Agent: We have a vision in mind, but we need to validate that vision here with the icon team to see if we're aligned, if we're off-base, et cetera.
Agent: So the whole intent of this proposal, this deck was, are we thinking about things in the right way?
Agent: Are we thinking about things here in a way that, um, ensure that we're both aligned in terms of what the outcome would look like and the approach to get to that point .
Agent: And if we can say yes, like, hey, cool, there's some things we're needing to work through and maybe we're gonna have the other. change this here when it's weak data setter, but directionally we're on the same page.
Agent: If that is the case, then we'll go through here with a more in-depth proposal that include all the different things from a delivery standpoint on our side that we will be responsible for.
Agent: I will call any of the other elements here that we're assuming that icon is going to want to own or whatever, and then that's going to be a much more detailed breakdown
Speaker 6: Of deliverables, requirements, timeline and then budget to hopefully check that.
Agent: Box for you . Got it.
Agent: And so what's the dependency for like on our side to do to kind of get that level of detail?
Agent: Yeah, so if I understand it, the reason why we're all in this call here [DATE-4] is because we put this kind of this diagram and place this model in place, but we needed to validate this Plan with the folks here on this call If there are no big hiccups if there's no big [GPE-4] that [PERCENT-1] chance is going to work.
Agent: We're not we're not interested in salesforce being the source truth We don't want to use this middleware. We want to build all these point integrations ourselves.
Agent: If that is not the case, if what we've outlined here thus far is a minimal on your guys' side, we feel like this is a good path forward.
Agent: That's basically all we need from a box being checked perspective to be able to go through and put them more in-depth proposal together with the notion and the understanding that we are on the right path.
Agent: We are on the same page. What I wanted to avoid, was putting an additional four or [TIME-3] or so into something that wasn't going to be viable until we had this conversation.
Agent: So if we can check the box on your guys aside, we're like, hey, no, there might be some subtle tweaks, but directionally, we're on the same page.
Agent: If we can confidently say that is the case, then great, we're off the race, so we can move forward on our side. If you're like, you know what, I don't know about this, I don't know about that.
Agent: Let's see, we have to have a powwow in terms of, we'll come back to you with our desired path forward, then we'll be in a holding pattern until we kind of get that direction.
Speaker 4: I had a question about, I guess, and you probably have seen this a bunch of times, but trying to figure out on our side to power some of these front ends, right?
Speaker 4: Like I'm a customer, I have a vehicle, like the end consumer, driving a car.
Speaker 4: Seems like if that data were to come in, let's say it comes in through, you know, however comes in and gets processed and then dumped into the sales force, you know, it's not Does it make sense to keep [ORG-1] the record of truth for like API calls from our front ends?
Speaker 4: That maybe they pass through icon calls to [ORG-1] to get that because you know otherwise then we're just storing the data also then we got to keep those two in sync Um kind of all the changes, you know migrations and stuff that we do for our database We need to then apply them to the [ORG-1] So what's the best practice there for who owns that data?
Agent: On the icon side and
Agent: How much does it just duplicate it everywhere or what are your thoughts?
Agent: Yeah, exactly. So it's a good question. We have another option. So there's as you, I'm sure where there's virtualization of data and then there's going to be the replication of data.
Speaker 4: With the know when we last marketed to this customer. We need to add a migration on our side to handle that, like in our database.
Speaker 4: Is that something that's driven, I guess there's more coordination there than needs to happen then?
Speaker 4: Because we're like, they're going to update this in [ORG-1]. [ORG-1] needs to send it over the wire to us via [NORP-1].
Speaker 4: We need to be able to consume that, but we need to run a migration or on the flip side, there's some feature we want to add to our app.
Speaker 4: Where we're like, of like a secondary driver to a vehicle or something like that.
Agent: Oh, there's now a concept
Speaker 4: Sure, sure, yeah. It's a [ORG-29] in our database that maps to another customer login. But now we've added that migration.
Speaker 4: How do we do that in [ORG-1]?
Speaker 4: Is there migration, like, you
Agent: Know, SQL migrations or how do you do kind of those migrations in [ORG-1] there?
Agent: Yeah, yeah, so I mean we can do things a couple of different ways. One can be programmatic. The other one would just be through a mass upload through a CSV file. So.
Agent: If we're saying let's say, hey, we built out [ORG-1], we have the icon app itself and you know what we want. The secondary driver.
Agent: And so for us, we know that we have a once-many relationship that we can establish Let's say there's an asset there's contacts that can be associated or else there's that there's a you know Household or something to that extent we want to add another person to household Basically, it's just replicating the record under some unifying parent.
Agent: That could just be an API call that comes over, said, hey, we got [PERSON-17], that she's the wife of [PERSON-14], and we have [PERSON-16] assistant.
Agent: We want to make sure that [PERSON-17] is in there, then through that integration, basically triggering event, it would then create that [PERSON-17] record in the household for [PERSON-14], tied to the same vehicle.
Agent: Now, we have two people to talk to around their unit. I renew it. So that could just be another pattern that we're building out throug [NORP-4] that would create that record.
Agent: But if you're coming to me and say [PRODUCT-4], hey, I go t secondary drivers that I need to add to the system. I've got them all in a CSV file.
Agent: Here's the unique identifier that we're leveraging to tie them to a household or whatever that is.
Agent: Then we just do that mass upload through a migration tool and it's taken care of here in a very short period of time.
Agent: So when it comes to migration of data, we can do it through a data in [ORG-35] that leverages CSV files, or we can do it programmatically
Speaker 4: And we're needing to batch it. We have a data migration for a schema change. I guess new field on the user record.
Agent: We're like, hey, we're going to start sending this
Agent: What needs to happen there to make that happen?
Agent: Pretty simple. So once again, [ORG-1] appointment click, everything is XML driven into [ORG-1].
Agent: And so we can we can go through the UI [PRODUCT-11] and we can go into the object model, or sorry, the object manager on the back end, navigate to the contact record, sorry, the contact object, click new field, create that new field, boom, here's the API name in that field, go into meal soft here and create the mapping between an icon and [ORG-1].
Agent: That could be relatively simplistic. The other option here is to use an IDE, like the just studio [LAW-1] or something like that. We want to go through and just modify it at the [LAW-2] level,
Speaker 4: We can do that as well. Okay. Got you. So it's more go click, and then, but like at this property, here's the name.
Agent: You should go in the UI, you should
Speaker 4: So you see that event notification come across on [NORP-1],
Agent: It would automatically start consuming that update.
EndUser: Precisely, exactly.
Agent: Right. Exactly. Right. Yeah. So there's all kinds of different things that we can do here from an underlying.
Agent: Platform configuration standpoint and the vast majority of those elements here all just point and click driven So the need to create a new field if we had to create a new field i could jump into salesforce right now and be done in [TIME-4] Um with having that created then jump into [NORP-1] You know be done in [TIME-5] of then creating that additional mapping here's my api name in salesforce Here's the source inside of The icon app and now they're mapped together.
Agent: So the idea here is speed efficiency Uh Um.. .
Speaker 4: When it comes to carrying out those types of tasks.
EndUser: Makes sense. Just take this example one step further, because we're. We have a number of two, three products that we want to put out there. One is consumer facing. It's called [PRODUCT-10].
EndUser: Uh, you buy a vehicle from a dealership. You get the GPS device. You get [DATE-8] on app that you can track the vehicle.
EndUser: Let's say a birth scenario where I want to add a, a user or something like that. I want our consumers to go into that app and say add my significant other as another driver or something.
EndUser: They're not going to [ORG-1] in this area like Is that we can do stuff like that into the consumer facing apps.
Agent: Customers would not.
Agent: It doesn't have to be all this like XML, [ORG-25], whatever stuff uploading. Yeah, yeah. So if I understand you correctly, if you're saying, hey, I'm going to go build out your own app. with iOS and [ORG-34], etc.
Agent: That's going to write to a database somewhere.
Agent: Now that database could be [ORG-1] we chose to, but if you're running that to another database, let's say the icon database, then all we have to do is spin up an Integration through MuleSoft that would listen for another row being added to your table for that additional driver or whoever they are, we have that listener set up and then that'll automatically cascade into [ORG-1] here for us, create another contact record.
Agent: The main thing that we're just going to need from an Integration architecture standpoint is going to be the unifying IDs of who this new person that's new row in your table needs to get mapped to as a new record inside of [ORG-1] to link them together.
Agent: But that's a very common integration, I guess, task where something happens, we're listening for that event to happen.
Agent: We grab the data, we transform it, however we need to We orchestrate that then into [ORG-1] just created into that system and we're using the external ID .
Agent: From your app that you just mentioned, I can only call it [PRODUCT-10], I think.
Agent: But you have your unique identifier for that particular row in your table, and we're going to persist that unique identifier to our contact records on [ORG-1], so now they're linked going forward.
Agent: Yeah, a good example would be one that you probably use [DATE-9] is [LOC-1]. So they use [ORG-34] on the back end to like say a customer comes in as I have a different billing address.
Agent: They can change in the app and assuming [ORG-3] is probably the most important system to recognize that change. Send it to [ORG-3], send it to [ORG-1] for the sales and service team to know. No one has to interact.
Agent: No one has to know Code from the customer user standpoint. It's meant to have improved that self-service.
Agent: So people don't have to call in, but they can still update some of those critical features, or even sign up for new subscription, or book a flight on [ORG-1], be able to see rewards points and all that type of stuff, which normally goes into all these ERP and other highly sensitive systems, but it's abstracted.
Agent: And kind of kept secure while still enabling them to feel like it's a simple change and it just routes it to the Recording or like the appropriate system where that key record is ideally
EndUser: Being hosted wherever you want that Okay, to be.
Speaker 4: That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. I had a question too about 5.9 and [PRODUCT-14] for those. I know I saw for 6.856489631920178, there was like a [ORG-34].
Speaker 4: I wasn't sure if it's like one of those, so it's like one of the click installs, it gets added in and then it's just a couple configurations, like put in your key or whatever your
Speaker 4: Api keys.
Speaker 4: How much of a lift is it to integrate those?
Speaker 4: Or if we're thinking about going with some other system, would it be a good time to switch because we could go find another app?
Speaker 4: Like another 6.452405020142364 or another [PRODUCT-14] that we thought was better fit. Like we've been looking at [ORG-36] and [ORG-36] pinpoint for some of our stuff. Um, and for [ORG-31] for sending a text notifications.
Speaker 4: Um, how hard is it to like pick a different
Agent: One if you wanted to go change that [DATE-4]?
Agent: Great question. And you're exactly right. Like now is the time.
Agent: Um, now the benefit that we have here is that 6.340778254933478, you know, I don't know when they created their Integration or their package here for [ORG-1], but it's been around for as long as I've been around.
Agent: At least in the [ORG-1] ecosystem. So it's fairly simplistic to go through and try those together.
Agent: Now typically what we have to dive into is going to be like the additional logic of when we just position this call and this has to happen here and then this and that.
Agent: So there's some nuance to it, but at a high level, has made it fairly easy to integrate its tool with [ORG-1]. Totally all same thing. So either one of those were not too terribly worked.
Agent: However, If we're looking at leveraging something different now is a great time. If you're looking at [PRODUCT-10] here already, [ORG-1] and this telephony solution uses [PRODUCT-10] on the back end.
Agent: If you're wanting to go through and use [ORG-36] here, as your telephony provider and then use [ORG-33] and all these different elements here within AWS platform, there's tremendous amount of overlap in terms of [ORG-1] and AWS functionality.
Agent: That would once again, bring more of our solutions here under a single roof. And there's additional bells and additional whistles. If you do decide to go the [ORG-36] [PRODUCT-10] route as it attains to telephony solutions
Speaker 4: Being leveraged inside of [ORG-1] from an [ORG-36] supervisor standpoint, from a call Recording and transcription standpoint on a variety of other elements here that really are helpful.
Speaker 4: Yeah, because a big feature I think we have missing [DATE-4] is like, you send these text notifications to customers, hey, you're due for an oil change.
Agent: And [DATE-4] they can't
Speaker 4: Text, they'll text back to the number, but like nobody, it's not hooked to that.
Agent: In anywhere. Nobody's listening like a big feature Um, and [DATE-4] We missed that communication.
Speaker 4: So it's been request.
Speaker 4: To go build that, like would be very custom, right?
Speaker 4: You, okay, well, I need to integrate with [PRODUCT-14] to talk back to five, [DATE-10]. And so we've been looking at other solutions
Agent: That maybe have chat bots and or an easy way to do that. It sounds like maybe that's just built into [ORG-1] the telephony solution so we don't even have to use . Yeah, exactly.
Agent: So we have we have to left any solutions. It's called Service Cloud voice.
Agent: Now I have a little bit of a bone to pick with the naming of that product because it makes it sound like it's only service based. That's not the case.
Agent: But yes, so from a telephony standpoint, [ORG-33] is what is leveraged that uses [ORG-36] here on the back end from a piping standpoint. So that's it from a calling, making your CD phone calls.
Agent: And then from there, we can also leverage SMS within the platform here as well in both broadcast capacity. Meaning I got to send a text out to 5,000 people or whatever the use case calls for.
Agent: Or we want to have a more conversational way of communicating. Now the benefit as you mentioned here. Is that it's all being routed through the same. underlying engine that other communication channels utilize.
Agent: [ORG-1] has what is called [ORG-47], an [ORG-47] routing, which as you'd imagine, whether it's voice, whether it's SMS, whether it's email, whether it's a web form, they all get routed through this [ORG-47] engine to then decide like who we need to assign this communication to.
Agent: And it goes through, we have people who are once again, they're active, they're currently able to take a phone call, they're able to take a text, they're able to take a live chat, they will take a new case, it's been assigned, whatever.
Agent: We can route it to those individuals, and then they can go through and they can continue working on that record, whether it's carrying on the conversation through chat or through SMS, or whether it's actually like taking action for a ticket, that somebody's got a question or something like that we need to facilitate.
Agent: So, yeah, once again, the benefit here, they're going to have to go through credit on these customers. I UI, [PRODUCT-11] components and interfaces, all this here is kind of taken care of by [ORG-1]
Speaker 4: Without the box functionality.
Agent: Yeah, it makes sense. There'd be a, I think, a huge value add there. It's true. So yeah, now is now is definitely the time if we're going to go and shop in so to say.
Agent: We have a lot of different options here. And if you're already looking at [PRODUCT-10], then I think it's a no-brainer.
Agent: And then secondly here, if we wanted to explore more options with comes to SMS and be able to handle both broadcasts as well as more communication type back and forth,
Speaker 4: Then that would also be a good option to explore. Yeah, we definitely need a more robust solution, but we just weren't sure.
Speaker 4: We're trying to target [DATE-11] or [DATE-14] timeframe to launch and we're supposed to go rebuild Integration somewhere.
Agent: A whole new
Speaker 4: Wouldn't take quite a while, but if it's something that's just like in [ORG-33] or it's like a they're
Agent: Already built into [ORG-1], in-house solution. It sounds like maybe that'd be pretty fast to implement then. Yeah. Then we're getting more towards this notion of [ORG-1] been around for [DATE-10].
Agent: With the whole idea that we want this to be the base of operations for as many businesses here as possible, the one key area that we don't have. Well.
Agent: That I wouldn't say is best in class is going to be the ERP and the accounting platform. That's where, you know, [ORG-3] comes into play. It doesn't mean that we don't have options, there's root stock, there's [GPE-5], etc.
Agent: There are a couple of folks who have built an application on the platform. But in my experience, you know, [ORG-3] typically wins out.
Agent: But yeah, across all these different use cases and these scenarios here that businesses are trying to solve for, [ORG-1] has the vast majority of them.
Speaker 4: What we typically go of [ORG-1] for, is ERP and accounting.
Agent: Out, side
Speaker 4: Gotcha. That makes sense.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah,
Speaker 4: Those are kind of my next set of questions. It's going to be about accounting like ERP. I think we're for sure you didn't have
Agent: To be for accounting to get off the big books, but I think the ERP one was still up in [DATE-17] possibly. Sure. I was talking with [PERSON-5] about that.
Agent: So one of the larger projects we took on was for a company that sold assessment seats and they handled everything from
Agent: Establishing relationships with farmers to grow the seed, all the way through to delivering the seed to [GPE-6] and to [GPE-7] and etc.
Agent: So as you'd imagine, there was a lot that had to go into managing hundreds of thousands of tons of seed [DATE-14].
Agent: And so what they, what we built out for them was basically like an inventory management system within the platform Um that allowed for them to say hey, we got a truckload of seed coming from farmer [PERSON-10] dropped it off at at this way station Whatever they call us.
Agent: We can remember now, uh, and then so we got the raw seed now We gotta take the raw seed. We had to break it up into lots.
Agent: We have to store it in the various bins Uh now this one bin is going to have five different lots of it etc So whenever we go through and we take seed and we sell it We want to know like which lot it came from based on a last in first out perspective Sorry, first in, first out perspective .
Agent: And then being able to then bundle those into like the [QUANTITY-2], whatever they were. So I got [QUANTITY-3] sacks and all came from one, two, and three.
Agent: And then I put them on a truck and needed to ship them out of here on this thing. So basically that is what has been what we built out more or less within the platform.
Agent: It sounds very similar to what I caught is looking to accomplish, which is, hey, we got a new dealership and they've got 1656 cars in the lot.
Agent: So we're going to go and we're going to fix all 2634 vehicles. here with units. We have a procurement order or else production order requests for 2,000 units .
Agent: Okay, let's go and break those up into your 64-unit lots. And we did that. And then now let's move them on to a fulfillment method flow and take those lots to take the amounts that we have.
Agent: Send them over to [ORG-44] in [GPE-8], [GPE-9], being able to track the shipment, being able to track the individual items, you know, if there's different serial numbers or Manufacturing numbers, whatever, and then be able to trace them back to the law, basically, and track it back to the production date.
Agent: We wanted to go and follow that sort of process we could, we definitely could, but that would be more of a build versus a buy with the [ORG-39] ERP.
Speaker 4: Not saying it can't be done, it just comes down to what's the best approach based on what you're wanting to accomplish in the timeline.
Agent: Yeah, totally. No, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I think we just have an investing. I have personally invested in that early at all. Yeah, and there are. Totally.
Agent: And then their plug and play applications that we can look to leverage on the platform as well.
Agent: There, there's been a lot of progress that's been made in that realm over like the last five or six years or so. That might be worth exploring here further if we don't want to leverage [DATE-16] ERP functionality.
Agent: So if that is the case, then by all means, we're happy to go through and have those conversations. Once again, we can build it ourselves.
Agent: If we want it, we can pull an app from the app exchange and leverage it, or we can just rely on [ORG-33] and then
Speaker 4: Just integrate it through meal self. So there's a couple of different routes that we can take. Just come down to which ones providing the most bang for buck.
Agent: Yeah, it makes sense.
Speaker 4: Because I think we have probably a pretty simple ERP need. Most part, like maybe a dozen SKUs. You know, our these lead times from [GPE-7], ship has, you know, what And what they're going to arrive now.
Agent: Most complicated thing is kind of knowing which, you know, cargo devices in it coming.
Speaker 4: What's that?
Speaker 4: I was going to say is it stuck in the panel at Canal?
Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah, exactly, right.
Agent: So
Speaker 4: Trying to lead times for those, and then how much is going out of our system to our various customers.
Agent: So it's kind of like our depletion rates. So then I think kind of those predictions is like the biggest need we need right now. Yeah, whatever other clients they sell. Chemicals for washing semi-trucks. And so.
Agent: Pilot, buckies, all the big gas station chains and whatnot. They're their customers. So as you imagine, it's pretty darn hard to go through and understand which tanks need to be refilled with products.
Agent: At what time across the entire country. Up in the north during the [DATE-17] time they use more because trucks getting dirtier here more frequently with ice and slush and all this kind of stuff.
Agent: And then down here in the south, it stays pretty consistent, but they have tank monitoring software.
Agent: And so through [NORP-1], we grabbed all that information from the tank monitoring software, we funneled it into [ORG-1], then be able to put that into a graph with like, [ORG-55], yellow, red in terms of, you know, who are the stations and the individual tanks and the products that need to be refilled.
Agent: And so we automated that process here of being able to grab all the information from the tank monitoring applications here.
Agent: And then once it went below like a threshold, then we triggered a refill request that was then facilitated by [ORG-1]'s [ORG-44] application throughout there and say, Hey, I got 61 tanks in [GPE-10] that are going to need to be filled [DATE-10].
Agent: And then they create their routes and they go through and fill them client, you know, never has to worry about it. So that's one of those things here that can be done. So on the icon side.
Agent: If we've got [ORG-31] got 1714 cars in the lot and then through the DMS Integration whether it's directly into [ORG-1] or through [ORG-25] then we can get an idea based on all of the car sale s that have been made If we say, hey, at 1786, we need to go throug h and restock them, or at 914, we need to go throug h and restock them, then we can do that once again provided that we have that information bein g funneled into [DATE-14] .
Speaker 4: Yeah, that makes some sense. Yeah, so I mean, maybe it is an ERP solution that would work for our use case. So I don't think we have a very complicated use case, not like an e-commerce store or whatever.
Agent: With SKUs we have probably seven SKUs Beautiful.
Speaker 4: I think right now or something like that.
Agent: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Agent: The other thing, one other thing I was going to mention here too, so the benefit that we have being able to look at.
Agent: Consumption or all demand for these units and demand for those SKUs that we have both the depletion rates on your current customers.
Agent: But then we can also combine that with our forecasting on the sales pipeline standpoint and take like a weighted average or just take a look at everything that's [PERCENT-2] to close them and beyond and then say like, my goodness, from a depletion perspective, we have to fulfill 52,000 units in [DATE-20].
Agent: Combine that with an anticipated 20,000 units from the sales front, we're looking at 61,000 that we're going to need to get installed in [DATE-20] or whatever that time period looks like.
Agent: So it's not just a matter of your depletion rates and restocking those dealerships, but also comparing and contrasting that against your pipeline where you're forecasting to need to help you guys make more informed decisions from a procurement standpoint where needing to get stuff from [GPE-7].
Agent: And then also delays here as well, typically are helpful when it comes to setting expectations.
Agent: With clients saying, hey, yeah, we're going to jus t find out fantastic However, taking a look at my inventory levels taking a look at what's currently in root we probably won't be getting the product here received or whatever you're freezing it you know, until [DATE-26] So instead of just kind of like sticking your thumb [ORG-46] in the air and just trying to measure the direction you're able to go through like with a pretty high degre e of accuracy, indicate how many units you're needing to order And then also when those units are expected to arrive on warning and the fulfillment of thos e. processes can be informed
Speaker 4: Based on information in the system. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah, because we have lead times are probably, [DATE-23] in some cases.
Agent: You know, well, Sure.
Speaker 4: Yeah. Um, you know, so you definitely need to, you growing, forecasting, we become high and high priority, we've had a couple of close calls Yeah, which is a great problem to have.
Agent: Know, especially now as we're rapidly
Agent: Running out of devices that we need to refill.
Speaker 4: But for sure. Yeah. I don't want to go over time over already [TIME-6] over time here. Um, But I guess for the next steps, [PERSON-5], I guess we probably should have like an internal sink.
Speaker 4: Now that we kind of really this hub and spoke model, see kind of what makes sense.
EndUser: And see if that these answers.
Speaker 4: Kind of works for us. And we have
EndUser: But very helpful. Yeah. I want to take your brain a little bit about what you're thinking. And what we're ultimately bringing in. So we can give these guys a better direction of what we're wanting.
Speaker 4: So yeah, if you got time after this, can I do this or just tomorrow?
Speaker 4: Do we have a copy of that diagram you were showing there cool?
Speaker 4: Is it in?
Speaker 4: Yeah, I have one.
EndUser: Okay.
Speaker 4: Perfect, [PERSON-14].
Speaker 5: And we're happy to resubrese in that to the team just to make it easier to digest on top of your email.
Speaker 5: Um, and just as regards as everything from our side, you know, does it look like we're our visions are aligned?
Speaker 5: And is there anything else that you need from us before we besides sending that deck?
Speaker 6: Uh, But one thing that'd be useful if we can include one page in that deck would be what assumptions that you guys have sort of assumed on your side.
Speaker 6: And on the icon side as well, right?
Speaker 6: That'd be a useful
Speaker 4: Artifact as well for us. Yeah, and then maybe the division of responsibilities.
Speaker 4: There's what kind of like who's going to own all these [NORP-1] integrations, API changes or whatever come down, migrations, kind of wears that handover or handoff between the two.
Speaker 5: I'm going to go ahead and just divide who knows what Yeah, that'd be fantastic.
Agent: Based on a RICON and icon.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-5], anything
EndUser: Else?
EndUser: No, not for me. I'll just connect with these guys. [PERSON-20], [PERSON-20], if you guys had anything here, [PERSON-1] kind of was in line with what you're thinking.
EndUser: Yeah, I agree. I think we're good then.
Speaker 5: Awesome, but guys, thanks for your time. Thanks
EndUser: Everybody. Appreciate it.
Speaker 6: See you. Take care. See you.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","The customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They did, however, ask several questions about the product's capabilities and how it could be integrated with their existing systems. They also mentioned some specific use cases they would like to implement. This suggests that they are actively exploring the possibility of using the seller's product to meet their needs. However, without a clear statement of satisfaction or suitability from the customer, it is not possible to definitively say that they feel the product meets their needs.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and addressing their concerns. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. When the customer asked about the possibility of building a two-way sync for data updates between their system and the sales rep's system, the sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the specific requirements and constraints of the customer's system. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more tailored solution.
2. When the customer asked about the use case for error handling and provisioning in the sales rep's system, the sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the specific scenarios and requirements for error handling in the customer's context. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more targeted and effective solution.
3. When the customer asked about the possibility of using the sales rep's system as the source of truth for their data, the sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's current data management practices and the potential benefits and challenges of using the sales rep's system as the source of truth. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more informed and persuasive argument.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs, but could have benefited from asking more questions to gain a deeper understanding of the customer's specific requirements and constraints.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:
- ""So once again, like what is our philosophy behind leveraging a [PRODUCT-1]?""
- ""And I know that this is a lot to kind of take in here and I believe that deck was shared previously. If not, we can share it here again. Hey, cool.""
- ""And then for folks who are needing to live in another system, then we make sure that we can send that information downstream, or if we need to get information from the system, we can then pull it back into our single unified platform, [ORG-2].""
- ""And I believe that deck was shared previously. If not, we can share it here again.""
- ""So, [ORG-3], best in class from a ERP standpoint, don't envision that going away, but we want to be able to carry out closing out an agreement here with a client, getting an initial order put together for the number of units we're needing to ship to a particular dealership, and then be able to send that information automatically into [ORG-3] here from a billing perspective or else at least planning the seat or also setting the statement.""
- ""And then talking with the rest of the team, it was very clear that we needed to get you all and involved in these discussions, kind of discuss the utility of that and see if there would be any potential issues or else any concerns here that we need to address.""
- ""And I know that this is a lot to kind of take in here and I believe that deck was shared previously. If not, we can share it here again.""
- ""So, what we're outlining here is a model to where [ORG-1] is the hub and these other point solutions are going to be the spokes. And then we're unifying them, we're integrating them through middleware.""
- ""And then talking with the rest of the team, it was very clear that we needed to get you all and involved in these discussions, kind of discuss the utility of that and see if there would be any potential issues or else any concerns here that we need to address.""

- ""And I know that this is a lot to kind of take in here and I believe that deck was shared previously. If not",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job articulating the value proposition of the company and product throughout the call. They emphasized the benefits of using their product as a unified platform for various tasks and processes, and how it can integrate with other systems to cascade the ramifications of work. They also discussed the potential cost savings and efficiency gains from using their product as the hub and other point solutions as the spokes. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have provided more concrete examples or use cases to illustrate the value proposition. For example, when discussing the potential two-way sync between systems, the sales rep could have provided an example of a specific scenario where this would be beneficial. Additionally, when discussing the possibility of building custom integrations, the sales rep could have provided more details on how this would save time and resources in the long run. Overall, the sales rep effectively communicated the value proposition, but could have provided more specific examples to make it more tangible for the customer.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So, [ORG-1], best in class from an ERP standpoint, don't envision that going away, but we want to be able to carry out closing out an agreement here with a client, getting an initial order put together for the number of units we're needing to ship to a particular dealership, and then be able to send that information automatically into [ORG-3] here from a billing perspective or else at least planning the seat or also setting the statement for it . When those invoices are paid or when we're needing to actually recognize the transaction of some sort.""

The customer seemed more engaged as they discussed the specifics of their ERP system and how the seller's product could integrate with it.

2. ""And then for folks who are needing to live in another system, then we make sure that we can send that information downstream, or if we need to get information from the system, we can then pull it back into our single unified platform, [ORG-2].""

The customer showed interest in the idea of a unified platform and the ability to integrate with other systems they are currently using.

3. ""And then for folks who are needing to live in another system, then we make sure that we can send that information downstream, or if we need to get information from the system, we can then pull it back into our single unified platform, [ORG-2].""

The customer seemed engaged in the discussion about the possibility of integrating their current systems with the seller's product. They also showed interest in the idea of a unified platform and the ability to send and receive information between systems."
video_19765_167_6qr3y000000occMAAQ,"Speaker 5: There we go.
Agent: There we go. Okay, everybody. Well, thanks for the time [DATE-1]. And we're here to talk about [ORG-1]. I do this with a number of accounts. This is specific for interest.
Agent: And we're going to go through quite a bit of different things here. And I've got it slated for [TIME-1]. I don't know if we'll need [TIME-1].
Agent: I usually run through these in about 72, so there might be an opportunity to give you back sometime at the end here, but at least we've got some time, some extra time if we need it.
Agent: As I mentioned, and I've talked to some of you on the call, but for those of you that I have it, my name is [PERSON-1]. I'm the platform account exec based here in [GPE-1].
Agent: I've been with [ORG-2] for a little bit over [DATE-2], and I focus on our platform, which has to do with integrations, has to do with sandboxes, and of course, as you that we're talking about here.
Agent: But my partner in crime, [PERSON-2], I'll let you introduce yourself.
Agent: And then if you could have [ORG-3] introduce himself, and I'm not sure that [PERSON-3] is on the call, but I'm sure you guys are all aware of [PERSON-3], your account director. So [PERSON-2], if you could do your introduction.
Agent: Yeah, nice to meet you all. I'm proud I'm the technical architect that's aligned with interest. Coming for another colleague of mine who is on sick leave. My role is basically helping seeing what challenges are.
Agent: And then from a platform perspective, what is the right platform for you to solve those challenges, get those capabilities in, and provide you an agnostic overview of whether that's [ORG-2] or something else. It's kind of my job to.
Agent: To call it out for you. So that's me. And then I'm more of a generalist. And I span across all different security integration app dev data management domains. But then for specific security compliance, conversations we have.
Agent: Another beer of mine, [PERSON-4], and I let [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5] himself, who's also security TA on my team.
Agent: Yes, good afternoon, everyone. My name is [PERSON-4], [PERSON-6], so I'm a security technical architect here at [ORG-2]. So very similar to [PERSON-7], but I focus a little bit more on security and compliance related conversations.
Agent: So I'll just be in the background here and I'll be chiming in. But yeah, here to answer any of your security compliance related questions as well if you have any stuff next to me to
Agent: All. Thanks, I appreciate it and for the interest team. You know, I think one of the reasons why I asked him to be on this is all he does is security.
Agent: This is what he does day in and day out. He talks to many more accounts and what [GPE-2] and I do. So this is really a team that I brought together that one can.
Agent: Focus in on security, but if you've got questions outside of that, then certainly we can address those or we can table them and come back around to get them.
Agent: But hopefully we've got the team here that can address any questions that you might have.
Agent: So and then, Gender, I appreciate it because that was one of the things I was going to ask you all to do an introduction and since we've got that already underway, I sure appreciate it.
Agent: Let me, now this next slide, you all have probably seen quite a bit because it's on all our presentations. It's a little bit of eye candy here.
Agent: I don't mean for you all to read it, but it really means that if you're in a buying situation, buy what's market ready [DATE-1], not anything that we might talk about in the future.
Agent: Base your decisions on what's readily available [DATE-1].
Agent: Like I said, I don't think we're going to be talking about anything, so I don't need anybody to go through and kind of read this, but if you want to, it's going to be in the recording.
Agent: And you can look at it at that point in time. As I mentioned, we've slated this for [TIME-1].
Agent: I don't know if we'll take [TIME-1] here, but I wanted to really go through this and explain the shared security responsibility model. We'll look at asnapshotofyourorg and that's your health check as well.
Agent: We'll talk about the built-in features that you get out of the box. I'm sure probably [PERSON-8] and [PERSON-9], you guys are familiar with this, but we just want to level set and bring everybody up to the same level.
Agent: We'll talk about what comes out of the box. But then I'll also talk about the products that take it to the next level.
Agent: So we have a lot of accounts that for whatever reason need to be able to have that enhanced security profile.
Agent: And it's a question that I get all the time is, well, why doesn't [ORG-2] just include this in all base offering kind of out of the box?
Agent: And the reason is these are highly processed, meaning that there's a lot of processing time on our side, and not every account needs that. So we look for that.
Agent: For those accounts that really need to take their security to the next level . I'll explain a little bit more on that as I get into it, but that's one of the reasons there.
Agent: As I looked at your specific profile and what you look like within [ORG-2], I'll come back with my recommendations here towards the end of the presentation.
Agent: And then I don't mean to put the next steps in Q&A at the end here. At any point in time, if you have any questions, please interrupt, interject, stop us. It's a little bit hard here.
Agent: So... when I can't see everybody's body language, if you're questioning something, but please either come off camera or come back on the camera and raise your hand or let me know if you might have any questions and we'll go from there.
Agent: Any questions on this agenda before I dig into it here?
Agent: Okay. I'll take no as a… as a good to go. So this slide really depicts that trust is our number one currency. And if you've been around [ORG-4] for a long time.
Agent: You know that this is something that we state all the time that trust is our number one.
Agent: And over on the left-hand side, you see that self-force has got a responsibility in that, but over on the right-hand side, you all have a responsibility on that trust factor as well.
Agent: And as we look into this a little bit more, as we look on this kind of left-hand side, this quadrant over here with external threats, This is where [ORG-2] really takes over.
Agent: This is what we've been doing for [DATE-3]. This is really our side.
Agent: If you go to [ORG-2] or excuse me, trust.salesforce.com, you can read how we secure our data centers, how we try to with breaches and everything else, how we defend.
Agent: The infrastructure and the foundation of [ORG-2] so you can read that at Trust.salesforce.com.
Agent: But over on the other side, the two-thirds of the other offering is really where we look at our customers to be able to bring in that insider threat because we don't know what those threats are to you.
Agent: And as you can see here, [PERCENT-1] of those breaches are from inside threats, potentially. And then you've got a compliance side over here as well.
Agent: So we don't know every customer is a little bit different on their compliancy and what is needed, but we have tools for that.
Agent: And that's something else that we look at So that's what I mean by the vecto r and the shared responsibility as we look at that side of it .
Agent: Now, as I looked at yourorg specifically for interest one, I want to thank you for being a [ORG-2] customer. [DATE-4] is a long time, and we appreciate that business.
Agent: And you've got a large footprint with us, right?
Agent: From [ORG-5], over 1,130 Sales and Service users to your Lightning platform users, [ORG-6], [GPE-3], some of the other things I haven't listed here. So I appreciate that on the [ORG-7].
Agent: We've already talked a little bit, [PERSON-10]. You talked about the... masking of your sandboxes [DATE-1].
Agent: But the other side of it is I put a snippet of your data and yo u know this better than I do, but you have close to or a little bit over a half a million contacts The accounts are substantial as well and then your leads and opportunities.
Agent: And this is all tha t potentially has [ORG-8], your private information within there and this is really the [PERSON-13] d interest, right?
Agent: This is where you guys already [PERSON-9] d and all of [PERSON-13] everythin g. Going back, representati ve What you should do from a marketing side how sales are doing what your forecast look like what your opportunities and leads and how those are flowing through So this information has to be protected to the nth degree because again as I mentioned it is a lifeblood of your organization Now the security health check and I'll ask are you guys health check that you can run on your side And maybe this is a question to [PERSON-8] or to [PERSON-9] are you guys aware of this?
Speaker 5: Aware of the security
Speaker 5: Yeah Do you run it periodically or when's the last time that you maybe run it?
Agent: Well yeah definitely periodically. It's probably been one or two since we've run it. Okay, good. And I bring this up.
Agent: One is educational informative because I've talked to some of our customers that didn't even know that this tool was out there. So this is a tool on your side.
Agent: And for the other folks on the call that may not be aware, this is tool that you can do your risk assessment on your own.
Agent: And it's really to look at the baselines to look at maybe some cut create some standards that you can look at and really gauge against. and then to identify and fix any of those issues that come up.
Agent: So when I bring this up, it's not to really point this out that hey, you guys that are a certain percentage because there may be reasons for that.
Agent: But as I go to that, it shows that you guys are at [PERCENT-2]. And that may not be, it says poor here, and that's just kind of our calculations.
Agent: But these are items that you'll want to look at periodically. And it sounds like [PERSON-8], you guys are doing it [DATE-1]. So I trust that you're looking at these. things .
Agent: Correcting anything 82 maybe the best that you guys were ever going to get.
Agent: I've seen accounts that have lower percentage and I've also seen accounts that have a higher one, but there's no, I'm not here to throw anybody under the bus or to identify anything other than make you aware of this security health check.
Agent: Any questions on this?
Agent: You've got some high risk settings here and as I go to the next slide, I just cut and paste some of your medium, some of your low and just some informational ones.
Agent: But any questions on this health check before I move on?
Agent: Okay. So what we're going to talk about now, and I'm going to transition to Pernard here in a little bit so he can address this for you, but
Agent: We're going to talk about what comes out of the box. Yeah, I'm sorry. If [PERSON-18], where we go to that could be, go another slide back.
Agent: And part of this read back is this is what we see and of course you're monitoring it, but I'd be remiss if I didn't call out certain things that I very occasionally see whenever there's some sort of breach and data breach or some [ORG-9] hacker trying to, you know, hack somebody's communities, for example, there are a couple of things that just jump out at me every time that customers reach out back again.
Agent: So I wanted to make a few callouts on this slide, specifically, where if you see the fifth point or second from the bottom, the number of objects will default external access set to public.
Agent: And you see that there are 9 objects like that in your org where which have that setting.
Agent: I'll just go back and see what was the purpose of that and who's accessing it and what was the initial business justification. Maybe you don't need it anymore and going back and removing that default external access.
Agent: Normally what happens is if you have a [ORG-2] community, and let me check with you. Do you have [ORG-2] communities as well, at all experience cloud that we like to call it site.
Agent: Discouraged, And th e world designed to provid e millions. Indeed, an d Markless let shif t Inflation solelyPods. Liste n to som e customers Yes, yes.
Speaker 5: Who hat e millions of fas t insurance accounts He
Speaker 6: Will consistentl y generate service i n
Agent: So what happens is that sometimes for users that are not authenticated and unauthenticated on this publicly available site through the guest user profile, we sometimes have workflows that expose [ORG-2] data. in the form of URLs.
Agent: So maybe it's just a form that you're in taking data on those public unauthenticated websites. But sometimes what happens is, it depends on how you've set it up.
Agent: If there is a possibility because they have complete public access to that object, that it's not an object that has sensitive customer information and that object is, you know, just used for that specific purpose and that the way you've set it up.
Agent: There is no way that somebody could essentially hack the URL of the of that publicly available site and extract data or superpose, uh, uh, prepose what that data is going to look like, um, on the basis of that.
Agent: So just calling that piece out so you can go back and, and preview that. Um, over here on this page.
Agent: And before we go to the next page, is there any other questions?
Agent: Any thoughts, comments?
EndUser: All right, and then on the next page. Don't worry. I think sorry front.
EndUser: I'm just trying to get up and I think This is one of the things that I know the team consistently looks at Probably worth another look at for us, but we do have a Colleague facing community that we use for corporate support.
EndUser: We have an external customer partner facing community that we use there for commercial We can serve commercial support And there are certain things that we do have that may there because they need to be visible for somebody.
Agent: That are
EndUser: But the other thing that we do that you may notice or have noticed is for our login to [ORG-2], both for our external facing community and for our internal colleagues, we have our own interest identity as a service product our login authentication.
Agent: That is
EndUser: And that's where we have our multi-factor authentication setup. Now, I don't know if that's recognized right
Agent: In the health check or not, but just so I'd mention it so you had that context. Yeah, that's really good. And I was assuming on my side that, yeah, you know, you have [ORG-10], I know you've [ORG-10] implemented.
Agent: So I'm assuming on my side, you have something like that. I don't know your product, you own a product of your own. But then trust that does that. But I was assuming that [PERSON-11] or something is already there.
Agent: But it's good to know that you have those controls.
Agent: The one that I was talking about, is even before that in the funnel, right?
Agent: Like it's not an authenticated user going through your identity service provider, identity provider, or doing an [ORG-10].
Agent: This is somebody unauthenticated, right?
Agent: And is able to still access your sensitive customer data that's sitting inside of your [ORG-2] org.
Agent: So just going back and reviewing those use cases and the security controls monitoring how those users are using [ORG-2], or which, what kind of data are they accessing on a regular basis, something, just to keep a pulse on for you and your organization.
Agent: But yeah, thanks for sharing that. And then the next thing, which I think you've already on some kind of said it that you've got an identity provider [ORG-2] is not able to view what you have in place [DATE-1].
Agent: Right?
Agent: So maybe enforcing login IP ranges on every request is something that you're already taking care of in your interest identity as a service product.
Agent: But What you can do is you can go back if you care about this at all, not that you need to, but if you wanted to change what the standard value should be, you can download these security settings in an XML.
Agent: You can update the values if you want to do to say these don't need to be enabled. so that your security score. It's not at [DATE-5] or whatever it was.
Agent: It's at 109 something because these are not relevant to you, and you're taking care of it outside of [ORG-2]. Just for example, if you didn't want to take care of it, take care of it inside of [ORG-2].
Agent: Just an [ORG-13] with it that I wanted to make a call out, that you can change these values so that your score just looks a little bit better, so that internally, when you're having a conversation with the executives around security, Whoa.
Speaker 5: It doesn't look.
Speaker 5: Interesting,
Agent: Ok. Yeah.
Agent: But reviewing this on a [DATE-6] basis, at least, is something that me and [PERSON-18] would always recommend, right?
Agent: Even if you change those values.
Agent: Like, are we still handling these things on the?
Agent: Honor identity provider side has anything changed over there.
Agent: Should we have another set of controls on the [ORG-2] side so that we can make sure, for example, I had a customer who wanted to make sure that the same user is not logging in from a different IP also.
Agent: So they were setting up certain security controls inside of [ORG-2] to prevent exactly that kind of behavior.
Agent: But you can obviously do inside of your identity provider, but another set of controls inside of your [ORG-2] or just because it's the... for brighter of their sensitive customer data . So,
Agent: Just wanted to mention those things. Sorry, [PERSON-18]. You can. No, that's good feedback. And [PERSON-8], I think you took some good points there.
Agent: But is there any other questions on that security health check?
Agent: That's our last slide on that.
Agent: Any cleanup that we need to do on that?
Agent: No, I don't think so. Okay. Well, let us know. I know oftentimes it's after the fact that you think of something that maybe, and we're here for you. So if there's something that comes up, just let us know.
Agent: But again, you know, a little bit of info commercial there. You know, a lot of our customers didn't know that was available to them.
Agent: So a lot of times we catch them a little bit off guard that they didn't know that they could. One, run that themselves and two, make some changes on their own to improve that health score on your own.
Agent: So I'm glad we're able to share that with you. Continuing on here, let's kind of focus on what I mentioned, what you get out of the box, what you already pay for.
Agent: And as we go into the next slide here, I'm going to ask [GPE-2] to come on and talk about kind of the lower part of this slide plus the next slide. In that upper
Agent: Part where it talks about [WORK_OF_ART-1] and some of the built-in functionality, I'll talk about that here in a couple of slides. So Pernard, if you can take it away on this slide. Yeah, thanks.
Agent: So I don't know how many of you have ever gotten.
Agent: What [ORG-2] does under the hood overview?
Agent: Have it has anybody ever kind of shared with you what our service delivery
EndUser: Model looks like under the hood.
Agent: Before.
EndUser: So
Agent: I don't repeat myself as the reason I'm asking the question. It's probably good. It's probably been a while. I know I probably need it at some point, but yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right.
Agent: So this stuff is exciting to me as an engineer and architect.
Agent: Because it kind of talks through how we are following industry best practices in terms of delivering the best service, most highly available, resilient, trusted platform that you build your critical customer, the story of critical customer data and build your business logic on top of.
Agent: So at the core of it, we have this trusted multi-tenant. platform . where we host them inside of our first party data centers [DATE-1].
Agent: And slowly what we're doing is we're also kind of moving away from owning the first party data centers ourselves to using something like an AWS to deploy our [ORG-2] services. So that's a little bit future state.
Agent: But [DATE-1] for our purposes, let's think of the physical infrastructure as first party data centers that we sales force. . manage and co-located spaces.
Agent: At any given point in time, we have four copies of your data, of your [ORG-2] instance.
Agent: Two of them being co-located near each other, and then the other being for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes at another region so that if anything happens, the earthquake cycle.
Agent: And hits one data center, be able to switch over immediately And [DATE-7], we switch the sit e that is hosting your [ORG-2] instance And all of this obviously is seamless to you, right As a customer, we let you know that this is happening but it really doesn't really impac t how your business users are using [DATE-7] They don't see your disruption in servic e whenever they are working out of [ORG-2] So it's all seamless under the hood That's it happening.
Agent: And then obviously we go through all these third party auditors to audit a nd we all those compliance documents around SOC 1, SOC 2. etc.
Agent: Are all available on compliance.salesforce.com that you can go to and also you can monitor the availability of your [ORG-2] instance, get notified whether if a specific instance is down or not by just simply subscribing to it on trust.salesforce.com.
Agent: So don't know if you've done it, but if somebody on your team really wants that visibility, they can sign up really easily on trust.salesforce.com.
Agent: But going further into the incident response, we have all of this on model where we have folks out in [GPE-4] and all over the world so that whenever time changes in different places, we always have somebody somewhere in the world globally monitoring our services.
Agent: And that's it. Basically, that's our infrastructure and the processes around it that support.
Agent: Our services and we built this scalable metadata platform on top of it so that you can go ahead and customize to nth degree of whatever data you want to store, whatever kind of data you want to store, whatever type of data you want to store, and also the different kind of business processes that you can build.
Agent: So essentially building a platform where we've enabled specific functionalities and purpose-built applications around sales service marketing economy. on top of this scalable metadata platform . That's what [ORG-2] control aspect of it is.
Agent: Be manage all of that for you and what's accessible to you as a customer.
Agent: Are those built-in features that you can start controlling how you want to use the platform?
Agent: There are certain that?
Agent: Add-ons on top of it.
Agent: Do I take care of you want to talk through it?
Agent: Should I go with that or do
Agent: You're talking about on this next slide. On this slide
Agent: Itself. No, I think that's good because I'll cover some of the other ones as we get past here. All right.
Agent: The built-in is a little bit important because you get a lot of the aspects that you're using already like identity and single sign-on and authentication that you've already implemented using your identity provider and [ORG-10] from external places so that you're following industry-based practices.
Agent: And also... Access control that you already have in place built using profiles and permissions, and health checks that we just went through with a limited amount of auditing capabilities that we'll cover in a while.
Agent: But if any of those access controls are not enough, we have some segments of customers who require additional add-ons and control around security and compliance inside of their [ORG-2] instance.
Agent: And that's where some of those boxes that you see. on top of our mention that we will cover in a while that our customers plug and play into their sale s first org .
Agent: Good.
Agent: Any questions on that?
Agent: I know [PERSON-10] had to drop, but for any of the folks that are still on, any questions on this side?
Agent: Okay. If not, [PERSON-7], if
Agent: You can take this one as well. Yeah, of course. And then we're going into a little bit deeper into the access control and the auditing capabilities that are available to you are the box.
Agent: So we start at the highest level, which is, and think of it from the least prevalent access standpoint, right?
Agent: Only give people the access to what they need to do, what they need in order to do the book that they have. So org wide settings is something where you set up authentication and IP ranges.
Agent: And specific log-inars where they can on the acces s sales force during [TIME-2] Obviously, you can handle this in your identity provider but those controls exist in [PRODUCT-1] as well where you can set those up .
Agent: I've seen customers do either or also their customers who have these controls in both the pleases as well.
Agent: Although that becomes a little bit more complicated in terms of management, but they just works for them in the way that their teams have been set up.
Agent: You know, IT is different from business operations teams, so they need different rules and manage them in different places.
Agent: Object level as we go further down where you define the profiles and permissions that let's [ORG-2] know who should have access to which objects and what is their profile?
Agent: So a service user would only have access to case and accounts and contacts, but a sales user would have access to You know, just a high political accounts contacts leads and opportunities, right?
Agent: They want to need access to everything. So just that's where you would manage this. Field level security is going further deeper into the object after you define those profiles and permissions to define.
Agent: Who should have access to which fields, so that every user doesn't need to see everything inside of an object.
Agent: You're being very intentional as to what they have, it also impacts their user experience along with security around what they should and should not see.
Agent: Then finally, how do you manage record level security is through sharing rules and role hierarchies. and the org by default that you said in the beginning.
Agent: You also have manual and [ORG-9] sharing, and you can set up Teams for letting them share mutual accounts and opportunities that they work on.
Agent: I've been really quickly, but any questions before I move to the auditing capabilities that are available out of the box?
Agent: Alright, okay, so for auditing we have you have out of the box login history login logout history. We can tell who login who logged out. That's available to you.
Agent: Then field history tracking is available for 22 fields per object [DATE-8] you can track. Sometimes that can get limiting but if not,
Speaker 6: That's a pretty good out of the box feature.
Speaker 6: Can I ask?
Speaker 6: I know at some point, I know sales force had talked about increasing that limit from 29 on the field history and in certain circumstances. I know they've allowed to increase that count from 25 to say 33.
Agent: Is that a possibility at all?
Agent: Now, [PERSON-18], we used to, I don't know how [DATE-9] that we had allowed customers to contact support and increase those elements like you talked about from [DATE-10].
Agent: Now it's actually, there's a filled audit trail product that you buy that can increase them to 72 up to 72 and have unlimited. And I'll talk about that here in a little bit.
Agent: But I think it was like [DATE-13] that we went away do that.
Speaker 6: From allowing customers to
Agent: Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.
Agent: And thanks for the question. It's not just 72, I believe, like you get 86 out of the park once you purchase it.
Agent: I believe it's just another request that [PERSON-18] can put up for you if you wanted it to bump it up to 73 fields per object also. So that's available as well.
Agent: Set-up audit trail is whenever you need to track like what kind of changes have happened to profiles, permissions, you know, gene sets, metadata that has been deployed, things like that.
Agent: You have access to set-up audit trail for those purposes. It's really helpful whenever you're thinking about SOCKs compliance. If you have to go through that, that's one of the things that can help you.
Agent: And it gets retained for [DATE-9]. But I've seen customers sometimes being...
Agent: It's helpful, but then it's a little bit limiting It only has four columns Who changed what and who' s who was impacted by the change and what was the timestamp. It doesn't really give you anything more than that.
Agent: And then field classification. I don't know if this, if you know this, but this feature exists, we released it [DATE-13] back or something like that where you can define the data sensitivity level.
Agent: And that's if you have to comply with things like [ORG-13], [ORG-8], CCPA, [ORG-18], [ORG-11], any of these compliances, you can create some compliance categorizations and then define the sensitivity level, define the owner of that specific data, data field, and classify it This is just metadata management inside of your sale s for stop check and fields within it It's really useful because then you can start using i t for additional controls that you can put on workflows Like do not process these records which ar e GDPR classified because of some certain compliance that are legal once you comply with.
Agent: For example, you can really do those workflows really easily once you've set up this data governance inside of [ORG-2].
Agent: All right, that's it for this slide.
Agent: Any thoughts, questions, comments before we move to the next?
Agent: Oh, I'm good. Yeah, there's a lot there and I just want to make sure a lot of times customers will have other folks that aren't as familiar with [ORG-2].
Agent: So it does help to kind of level set and bring everybody out. I think you guys are pretty well advanced on that side. So we'll continue on here.
Agent: Now how much are you aware of the [WORK_OF_ART-1] offering in these components within [WORK_OF_ART-1]?
Agent: I just want to see what kind of depth
Speaker 6: I need to go to.
Speaker 6: Are you guys familiar with [WORK_OF_ART-1]?
Speaker 6: Anybody?
Agent: It's been [DATE-18] since I've visited it actually or implemented it.
Agent: So, okay, so this will be what we'll do what [PERSON-7] and I will do is go through kind of base level and answer any questions you have. But chilled is made up of these four products.
Agent: It's an umbrella that these four products sit underneath, but these products can be bought individually or they can be combined. So what we'll talk about here when we talk about [WORK_OF_ART-1], that means it's the four products together.
Agent: But individually, like event monitoring, I have a lot of customers that buy just event monitoring. But if they buy event monitoring and field audit trail, then it might make sense just to buy the whole [WORK_OF_ART-1] just economically.
Agent: But as we go through that, just keep that in mind that [WORK_OF_ART-1] is all for the products together, but they can be bought separately and individually.
Agent: And as we look at event monitoring, I really wanted to highlight event monitoring because this is one that probably is the standout product of these four products as we sit here, but it allows you to prevent to mitigate and to monitor those threats.
Agent: And I kind of describe it, it's like the security for your office building. You want to know who's coming and going. You want to know how long they stayed potentially.
Agent: You want to know what they did, why they were at the office, so on and so forth. That's what event monitoring does for [ORG-2]. It looks and sees who's done what within [ORG-2].
Agent: Where have they been?
Agent: Kind of the footprints that they have left. And I can't tell you how many times, especially [DATE-11], I don't know why it's [DATE-11], maybe it's because of COVID now that I think about it.
Agent: But more customers have kind of inquired in that they had somebody logging into their system [DATE-18], [DATE-18], [DATE-13] after they departed the company and how can they lock them out for sure?
Agent: How can companies, where can they see where they've gone and all those kind of things?
Agent: That's exactly what event monitoring was built for to be able to monitor those things. type of activities .
Agent: And as we look at event monitoring on those use cases, again, the user and application visibility as I talked about, but also that data loss prevention.
Agent: When I mentioned to you that you guys have been a customer for [DATE-18] and all the customers and accounts that you have within their That's a lifeblood of your organization.
Agent: And how do you really control that?
Agent: How do you make sure that somebody doesn't get disgruntled and say, you know, I'm going to leave this company, but before I do that data was mine. I put it in there.
Agent: I'm going to take it away from the system and take it to the competitor.
Agent: How do you lock them out of doing that type of stuff?
Agent: And that's what event monitoring is for. One of the other ones is productivity and adoption.
Agent: How are people utilizing [ORG-2]?
Agent: Where are your best users going and what are they doing?
Agent: And how do we analyze those workflows and remove the bottlenecks so people can get things done a lot quicker than before. But then also the fourth one over there, the performance monitoring.
Agent: How do we get real-time insights into maybe the API usage or the execution of data within [ORG-2]?
Agent: So, [GPE-2], before I go on any, other color commentary
Agent: That you want to add to this line?
Agent: No, I would just say that data loss prevention is always talking to my for a lot of customers that I talk to.
Agent: So preventing them from exporting reports, right, that have sensitive information in them, or limiting how much they can export, or getting at least notified whether some malicious actor is exporting reports or accessing data through the API through predictive events is like just some of the things that I've seen customers be interested in.
Agent: And then from a performance monitoring standpoint, I've seen like [ORG-18] is a really good use case where they kind of went into the logs and saw that it was taking [TIME-3] for a case to be created.
Agent: Within their instance, because of slow apex and flows that they have had going on triggers.
Agent: And they knew exactly which triggers were the biggest offenders because they had all these monitoring logs of how much CPU time it's taking, how long is that processing time in the database taking, because of the way they designed those triggers, and went in and optimized them because they knew where to look.
Agent: And brought that [TIME-3] down to one second, so which was impacting a lot of their key business KPIs around case closure time and case to handle time and things of that each.
Agent: So I don't know, is any of these use cases kind of resonate with you, interest
Speaker 6: On the interest side that you're hearing from the business?
Speaker 6: Yeah, I mean, I can see definite benefits to having some of this. I think I would want to look at our internal use
Speaker 5: Cases a little bit more in depth. First. Yeah, that performance monitoring one was interesting. You know, people complain that records take a long time to say whatnot.
Speaker 5: And we have, you know, two, three different triggers Getting some more information there can be helpful.
Speaker 6: Against that object.
Speaker 5: Yeah, especially on
Agent: The lightning side. Yeah. Yeah, good. Good and I think, you know, as we go on, there's some other ones. I won't belabor the point.
Agent: I think we've talked about a lot of these, but you know, the event logs, the ability to turn those on. and have those event logs give you real-time information into what's going on.
Agent: So that's part of the key features too that you can look at as you guys look at your internal use case for event monitoring.
Agent: But then also, this is one of the key slides that I like because I'm not going to read each of these two and you can pick out some of those that might come in.
Agent: But, you know, and for now, I've kind of talked about this.
Agent: What reports are being accessed?
Agent: You know over on that right hand side under the privileged access which users You know have changed to system admin over [DATE-11] or down in that right hand corner You know, what are the top 10 reports that were exported [DATE-26]?
Agent: This just gives you that visibility into what, where somebody has been. And those are the questions, as I mentioned, those companies that come back to me and go, hey, we know this person got into our system.
Agent: We just don't know what they did. We don't know where they went. We don't know what they took.
Agent: Is there any way to do that?
Agent: And this is a great way and that's what I'm saying that event monitoring has really been the rock star of [WORK_OF_ART-2] offerings and if there's any one product that I'd recommend that you guys do acquire event monitoring is it and I'll talk about it here in a little bit but any questions on this before I move on And there's a lot here and again, we'll provide you with these slides so you guys can look at them but It really is compelling when you see all the things that it can do.
Agent: And, Pernav, I don't know if there's anything here. This is kind of our last slide on event monitoring. I don't know if there's anything that you wanted to touch
Agent: On here on this one. Yeah.
Agent: So, [PERSON-18] mentioned, in the previous slide, the event log files, right?
Agent: Those logs contain 72 plus events, and events can be [ORG-18] exception, [ORG-18] triggers, flows, workflows, things like reports, list views, APIs, like all of these are events in itself.
Agent: And they get retained for [DATE-22] inside of [ORG-2] and those event log files.
Agent: What happens is that it's very reactive in the way that you have to go into the logs and see and analyze where what's happening, what had happened previously and things of that nature.
Agent: What we're trying to get to is the proactive piece of monitoring [ORG-2] where we have enabled a subset of those 69 events as real time. So you can see those on the left.
Agent: That's the comprehensive list of those real-time events that you can then start creating security policies on top of.
Agent: So what I was alluding to earlier around somebody's trying to export a report or API, data through API, you can block that action if you want to do.
Agent: You can let them go through two factor authentication or just notify somebody on your side that somebody summons exporting this report which has PII information. It's a very common use case that we've seen across other customers.
Agent: But other, you know, login events, getting notified of who's logging in from there and things of that each of you.
Agent: There are real-time in nature so you can build real-time policies to be notified of log certain actions on the basis of this. So that's really useful in that space. That's the proactive part moving away from reactive monitoring.
Agent: And then I think I see a lot of customers. struggling with what kind of policy should I put in place.
Agent: I just want [ORG-2] to tell me that something anomalous has happened and I should go and look at it. And that's where those like threat detection events, those predictive events come into play on the right.
Agent: And those are four predictive events that give a score from 0 to 69 as to how anomalous this behavior is. And specifically around reports and APIs. but also session hijacking and credential stuffing attacks.
Agent: That can happen also at the same time. So just to give you an example of what Report Anomaly event does, it's like if me as a user in your org, I start exporting a bunch of reports.
Agent: The Report Anomaly event is going to give a really high score, like an E.T. or [DATE-11], that this is anomalous for Pranav. He's not exported these many number of reports before.
Agent: You can go and review that, get notified on it. go and review that event and give it feedback to say, this is normal for [NORP-1] because he has to run these reports [DATE-29].
Agent: So this is normal behavior from it. Give it feedback so that the [PRODUCT-2] kind of goes ahead and learns also on the basis of the feedback that he gave it.
Agent: So it's kind of much as reactive proactive, but also going towards
Speaker 6: The predictive aspects of monitoring malicious activity happening inside of your [PRODUCT-3].
Speaker 6: So if you have a question that's kind of along the same lines as that, is what kind of out-of-the-box analytics come along with, say, a monitoring situation?
Speaker 6: Do you guys have reports and dashboards or... and reports and dashboards that come along with [WORK_OF_ART-1].
Speaker 6: I know it's been [DATE-25] since I've used it so when we had implemented it we had to kind of come up with our own series of reports and dashboards
Agent: So I just didn't know if that had changed over the course of [DATE-18]. Yeah it's It's changed a bit. You still might have to customize depending on the use keys.
Agent: But what I can do is, [PERSON-18], I can show you what pre-built reports and dashboards you get and are available.
Agent: And then, most likely, it's going to spur some thoughts around maybe our ideas around maybe we need this few holes and that will require a little bit more customization.
Agent: So, so you can walk through the art of the box stuff and
Speaker 6: Talk about use cases that require customization. If that's helpful. Yeah, I think if we have time at the end, that's fine. Otherwise, just knowing that there are some that come along with it
Agent: Is pretty good. place for us to start. So that's fine.
Agent: [PERSON-7], did you want to do that now or do you want to wait till the end?
Agent: Let's wait till the end. Get through the slide section. Yeah. Okay. Right, that's good. And just remind me of that. So I don't don't forget as we get to the end here. But let's continue on, but good questions.
Agent: And there's a lot with event monitoring. And [PERSON-18], it sounds like you had some history with it in the past.
Agent: And, you know, what's [WORK_OF_ART-1] that when you buy [WORK_OF_ART-1] as the all the products together, you get data detect. And this is a product that probably was launched now, I don't know, [DATE-32], maybe [DATE-25], but.
Agent: It will run through your data and find and classify that sensitive data very quickly. So it's just a tool.
Agent: You only get it when you buy all of [FAC-1], but it's just a tool to kind of run and find that classified data that might be hidden in some different fields or different pages of [ORG-2].
Agent: And as we continue on platform encryption, it simply does that. It encrypts that sensitive data at rest. [PRODUCT-4],
Agent: Is there anything else that you want to share about platform encryption?
Agent: This is the only slide that I have on it.
Agent: Really, you have access to classic encryption, but that's a little bit limiting because platform encryption knows you didn't grip literally everything. Files, attachments, standard fields and all custom fields, which the last encryption does not.
Agent: And then I've seen customers be really interested in bringing your own key functionality. I don't know if that's a requirement you're seeing come from your security or legal team.
Agent: But that's another reason why you would probably go ahead with platform encryption feature. OK, so let me go on to the next, excuse me, feature within [WORK_OF_ART-1], which is filled audit trial. So this is.
Agent: You know, event monitoring is kind of the number one product right behind it is filled out a trail and when I've looked at your or within how the limited view that we can have within there.
Agent: And I think [PERSON-18]'s what you mentioned. I saw that you are up against the limits in I think six or seven of your different objects here.
Agent: And we talked about it a little bit that it's set at 22 right now. You can't go to 18 unless you knock off one of those fields and bring it again to 18.
Agent: But by adding filled audit trail, you can take it up to 57, if not 111 additional fields per object. The big thing there is the retention. So over on the out of the box functionality, it's [DATE-29].
Agent: If you do buy field audit trail, then it does put it to an [ORG-13] retention. So you guys had already seen that.
Agent: I just wanted to make you aware of it as I kind of looked at things on my side.
Agent: Any questions on that part, that element?
Speaker 5: Don't know for me. Go configurable Yeah, what was the question, [PERSON-8],
Agent: Retention policy.
Agent: Just to explain
Agent: That a little bit. Yeah, if you could. Yeah, so configurable retention policy, you get to.
Agent: So, as you can see, you go beyond [DATE-29] retention period, right?
Agent: For all the objects. And sales force, you just sometimes I've seen customers have requirements around well for a constant contacts. I'm on a routine at force.
Agent: Up to [DATE-33], but for cases, that's just [DATE-40] of retention period that I need. So configurable retention policy is just going ahead and defining the retention period for specific objects on the platform. If not, that's fine.
Agent: You can keep it for [ORG-13] retention period. Keep
Speaker 5: Getting stored in the archive. Okay, could that go down to the field
Agent: Level as well?
Agent: Or just object?
Agent: That's a good
Agent: Question. I am not
Agent: Sure. I believe object level.
Speaker 5: It's, I believe it's
Agent: All right. Thanks.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: Any other questions on that, [PERSON-8] or anybody else?
Speaker 6: This might be a really dumb question, but is there any space issues and concerns?
Speaker 6: So if we start tracking up to 53 fields per object and we're tracking
Agent: All of those different changes on every field for all of our different objects, are we going to eat up our space?
Agent: That's a good question. No. So.
Agent: For all of these things like the event monitoring, event log files and this field or a trails history tracking objects, these are all a separate big data, a new based data store that sits next to the [ORG-2] objects that you have, doesn't get counted against those limits as its own separate storage but is still within the
Speaker 6: Platform. and its
Agent: Own big data, big data table.
Agent: Ok, great. Thank you. Yeah. Event OK, so I'll advance on unless anybody has any other questions. Now I know mentioned you guys are building your own data mask for sandboxes.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-13]
Agent: Is that did I hear that correctly, [PERSON-8]?
Agent: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So I won't spend a lot of time on this. This is you guys probably know this was a product.
Agent: That came out, I don't know, [DATE-40], [DATE-29], time flies, but to do exactly probably what you guys are building to anonymize and to lead any of that data.
Agent: So anybody that's not authorized in that sandbox doesn't have the ability to see that and to function on it. So, again, I put it in here without knowing that you guys were building that.
Agent: So just kind of keep that in mind as we progress on here. You do have those three sandboxes and the partial.
Agent: Are you guys sitting pretty well, [PERSON-8] or anybody?
Agent: Do you know that you guys are utilizing those sandboxes and any needs around additional sandboxes at this point in time?
Speaker 5: Yes, we actually had the third full license being used by a second partial copy, which is no longer. So we're down to two being used.
Speaker 5: But then we were having some conversations about, you know, the time that we had, you know, [DATE-40] back You know, sandbox and how to just make sure that we're safe in case, you know, for some reason that the one the sandbox provided by remedy force.
Agent: About that remedy force.
Speaker 5: Somehow went away on [DATE-29] that was safe for that. Okay, no, I didn't have anything. I think we're in pretty good shape here
Agent: From my perspective. Okay, well, let us know. I mean, certainly that's something that we can help you guys with and we can have a further discussion.
Agent: I know that we had that discussion in regard to remedy force, but there's anything else that comes about that I think a lot of times people think sandbox is no big deal.
Speaker 5: They are a big deal, right?
Agent: And they can run into a lot of different things and help in a lot of different areas. So we're here to help you on OK. And let me go back.
Speaker 5: That side if we need to.
Agent: Do you guys have a current Backup solution in place?
Speaker 5: Yes, we use autorabbit for data
Agent: In metadata backup.
Agent: And how's that working out for?
Agent: Is that working out pretty good?
Speaker 5: It's OK. Yeah. We gladly haven't had to use it a time. No big disasters have come up. But yeah, there's some testing to be done, from required from the business a little bit more in depth testing on it.
Speaker 5: And there are some quirks to it, for sure, but I
Agent: Think more to come there. Well, let us know. I mean, this product was released, I don't know, [DATE-40] now. We've got a pretty good roadmap available on this. Certainly, this is built on our platform.
Agent: It's going to be updated. I see it's economical. It depends on how much you have in your data storage [DATE-1].
Agent: But this might be something that you guys want to look at when your auto rabbit is up for renewal or something.
Agent: We can always let you trial it and see if this might be something that you guys might want keep that in mind.
Speaker 5: To swing over to. So
Agent: Okay. Privacy Center don't know, you know, what type of compliance needs and concerns that you might have. You know, I've kind of mentioned some of that, the rights two forget.
Agent: [PERSON-18], the, you know, data access request, any of those things. We have a product called [ORG-18] that helps with a lot of those. I don't know if you guys get into some of the SOCs, [ORG-11] requests.
Agent: These are some of our products that help to handle some of those things.
Agent: So if you guys are looking to go public at any time this may be something that you want to look a t from a [ORG-2] perspective . Any questions on
Speaker 6: That offering?
Agent: Ok, so as I looked at the recommendations, I think we've talked about it here, right?
Agent: The health check you guys are doing that. So [PERSON-8], I commend you for. running that [DATE-6] or twice a year to be able to look at that and make those adjustments.
Agent: I do think, you know, and this is we're at [DATE-40], right?
Agent: We're at our [DATE-36], [DATE-33], the sales forces [DATE-29].
Agent: If you guys are looking at potentially acquiring any of these solutions, you know, let [PERSON-3] and I know and we can come up and make you the best offer we can.
Agent: But I think from a field audit trail, that's one, and then event monitoring is the other one from the shields. side of it. If you don't want to look at all [WORK_OF_ART-1] all up .
Agent: We can take data mask off of there because I again was aware of that and Backup we can take off of there.
Agent: So I think if you guys just potentially look at field audit trial and event monitoring, that might be a good security risk kind of comfort if you will that you've got those things taken care of.
Agent: How does that resonate and how does that sound with you guys?
Agent: Is that something that you guys potentially are going to consider?
Speaker 6: I was trying to come off of mute there.
Speaker 6: Yeah, I think we're looking at all of our options currently, right?
Speaker 6: So we're coming up to [DATE-34]. And so we are currently in right now.
Agent: Planning stages
Speaker 6: And so we're looking at all of our options. So this is definitely why we're doing this now. Okay.
Agent: So, yeah, so I'm going to be reconnecting up with [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-11] kind of next steps. Okay. And, you know, [PERSON-3] and I will do what we can.
Agent: We want to make a deal and make you guys the best table possible. And like I said, now's the time to do it. So if that's something that you guys are looking forward to, let us know.
Agent: But then overall, as far as the Content of this, and I always ask the companies that I do this with, have we left out anything?
Agent: Have we, you know, are there, is this a time to value?
Speaker 6: Was this a valuable to you as we presented this information to you?
Speaker 6: Yeah, definitely find value in this. One of the questions that I have is say we wanted to look at field audit, trail and event monitoring.
Speaker 6: What type of Implementation services does [ORG-2] offer once you do obtain [FAC-1]?
Speaker 6: Is it something where The expectation is that we look at acquiring the third party to help us implement it.
Speaker 6: Is it something that you see we can easily do in-house ourselves?
Agent: And what kind of timetable does something like that take for us to of end go kind to end?
Agent: Yep, good question. [PERSON-7], I'll let you kind of address that and calm if you want to chime in as well.
Agent: So I think the most... most relevant features, [PERSON-18], the field audit trail and event monitoring, right?
Agent: So I'll just speak to those two. Field audit trails, since you're already using field history tracking, it's just, it lets you select more fields. So that you're already using it. It doesn't require any Implementation partner.
Agent: Pretty easy to add additional fields to the objects that you want to track. So that's easy. The second one being event monitoring.
Agent: The collection of the logs is just a radio button that you check off and it starts collecting the event logs.
Agent: The place where you need to do some work is planning with your team and discussing what kind of security policies you want to put into place.
Agent: Setting up the security policies, again, really simple if you're using [ORG-26] UI. It's point and click, really easy to set up.
Agent: I don't know if the requests get a little bit too [ORG-22] around the logic and filtering off the data that you want to execute on for the security policy.
Agent: That's [PERSON-26], and that will require a little bit of programming. So I don't know if you have an in-house developer who develops an [PERSON-26].
Agent: And then the other part would be the dashboards, right?
Agent: And I can show you the dashboards that are the box so that you can get a sense of what you get out of the box and if you need to customize it further, can you do it by yourself?
Agent: Or do you need an Implementation partner to help you with that?
Agent: It just really depends on what your team can take up in terms of skill sets that you have. Otherwise, I've seen customers do it mostly by themselves, field-ordered field. Well, that's obviously said, but even monitoring
Speaker 6: Implementations.
Agent: Okay, sounds great. Thank you. Good. And then, and [ORG-11], I'll have you pull up those reports here in [TIME-4]. I want to run through. I think one more slide here.
Agent: This is a question that I usually overlook because I get so busy on some other things. But within our or within our [ORG-2] instance, we have a field that's called security contact.
Agent: So if we need to reach out to you all for a security breach or something, we need to know who to go to and who to get to. very quickly.
Agent: This can be one person, this can be a multitude of people. So if you hav e that [DATE-1] that you want me to add this into our internal system or if you want to emai l me .
Speaker 6: Whoever that may be or with a group of people then I can add that for you but
Agent: Do you know who that security
Speaker 6: Contact would be?
Agent: And if not [PERSON-18] you can always email it to me and we can fill this. Yeah I'll let you know.
Agent: Yeah, just take it as it to do because, again, I like to always ask the question because that's a pretty crucial time.
Agent: If there is some security things going on that we need to alert you guys, who is it or what group of people do we want to alert?
Agent: So keep that in mind. Okay, I think that's it on my slides.
Agent: [PERSON-2], I'm going to switch over to you or have you take over presenters, right?
Agent: But just on my piece here, definitely the effort that you guys did to show
Agent: Want to say thank you for the time and
Agent: Up [DATE-1]. And certainly with the questions and the involvement, I do appreciate [PERSON-2], there you go, you can take over.
Agent: It.
Agent: Yeah. So let me know if you can see my screen. We got it. Awesome. So first I'll show you what event monitoring comes with. There's 18 order the box dashboards and they're listed over here.
Agent: I can also share this link with you over here so you have it. But the way it works is it's simply the same [PRODUCT-5] analytics.
Agent: Licenses that you get, 10 of them as part of event monitoring and those licenses are restricted to be only used to look at the event monitoring log file data. And that's where the dashboards are coming from.
Agent: So it's like any other experience, simply going to app launcher and launch your analytics studio. And you can see in my demo org, there are a couple of other box dashboards that I have over here.
Agent: So just show you, give you a taste of what that looks like when I look at page views dashboard.
Agent: It shows things at a high level like click throughs, how many of them total users, maximum average page time, average page time loads. page views by users and the trend of the same. So you can filter by user.
Agent: If you know it, [ORG-29], it's really easy to just drop down and click on Explore and change the view if you wanted to.
Agent: Otherwise, things like, this is a little bit relevant to customers when they really want to know and make sure that the folks who are accessing [ORG-2] are accessing from the same IP addresses that have been allowed listed.
Agent: So this gives you a pretty good list of where are those IP addresses that are being used for logging into [ORG-2]. And this demo that I'm showing you is this [ORG-25].
Agent: Everybody's demo work that anyone in the world can sign up for and start using. So we installed the event monitoring feature or set up event monitoring feature over here. And that's where the data is coming from.
Agent: This is live data of people actually all of the world going in and using this org. So you can, that's why you see different IPs from different regions of the world.
Agent: Page views by user and also raw long data.
Agent: I just have a couple of fields displayed over here, but obviously you have the flexibility to go in and change this and show additional information that's stored within the log file.
Agent: And that's just one of them, right, that I showed. We go into report downloads. It's been a nice and subjective thing with this.
Agent: But yeah, it looks like that's not many people are using the reports and not many people are exporting the reports, which is also a good insight if you're managing [ORG-2] instance.
Agent: Yeah, also the raw log data is letting me know who did that.
Agent: What was the [ORG-18]?
Agent: What is the IP timestamp?
Agent: And what is the system that they accessed from?
Agent: So like I said before, really rich set of logs that you get and a lot of data that you get out of these.
Agent: So you can go back and analyze what's happening inside of your org, who's interacting with board, what are the clicks and the scrolls that are happening on each page. It's important if you're.
Agent: The security perspective obviously is super important, but it's really important if you're trying to justify the value of your investment inside of [ORG-2] as well.
Agent: Right, like who's using [PRODUCT-6]?
Agent: How much are they using?
Agent: Are they using it in the way that you've designed [ORG-2] to be used in?
Agent: And that's where one of the pre-built dashboards that one of our customers success architects based out of [LOC-1], who works with a lot of big customers like, perchays and [PRODUCT-7], built these prebuilt dashboards based on event monitoring data and sales and [ORG-32] data model, all value analytics.
Agent: And I can show you what that looks like, but basically it's a free package. The only caveat is that you should have event monitoring, event log files through event monitoring and also [PRODUCT-5].
Agent: A couple of [PRODUCT-5] licenses lost our growth for your admins to view this data because you need to bring in the sales and [ORG-32] information as well.
Agent: Before I go into the value analytics and show you what that looks like,
Speaker 6: Any thoughts, questions and comments around this?
Agent: Yeah, this was very helpful to see that I appreciate it. Yeah, of course. And then I just wanted to show that. the value analytics app. I mean honestly I spoke to the architect.
Agent: This stuff people is really cool because just showing you one thing like the tech that counter right how many apps are not being used how many objects are used [ORG-18] classes visual force pages right this is a pre-built dashboard [TIME-5] you open it up install it in your org.
Agent: You get a high level overview and then you can explore and see like what are those effects classes that are mentioned over here that are not being used for example.
Agent: Right so really quick time to value whenever it comes to comes to you some of the things. Other, the vision of this these pre-built dashboards were around adoption and performance.
Agent: So like what are the users doing?
Agent: What's that user activity and the journey of a user?
Agent: So some of these around users, sessions, pages, clicks and the [LOC-2] daily and [DATE-46], between all of them.
Agent: Also, number of apps being used, which are those applications, seems like it's sales that's being accessed the most by these users. And then deep diving into what are those objects, what are those components.
Agent: I've seen customers use this dashboard to have conversations with their business around.
Agent: If the business is coming to you and saying, we need to reconfigure this page and put these components in because of X, Y, Z, you have the data to Backup the justification to prioritize that feature to be released in your [ORG-2] production instance, because you can see that it's like, for example, lead is the most highly used.
Agent: It's a little bit obvious that. It would be, but leads is the highly used object over here . next to opportunity and homepage.
Agent: So prioritizing these pages and the feature on these pages is probably the best thing for your team to do, so that it's helping you manage, prioritize your backlog and roadmaps. And then finally, things value and service value analytics.
Speaker 5: Like sales
Agent: Where do you have service card by the way?
Agent: At all in your org. Yes. All right, so let me go into service value and give you a give you a sense of what that is. So it kind of shows you.
Agent: Who's using say who how are your service reps using [ORG-2]?
Agent: So these are the case owners. We've abstracted the names, but you could obviously populate the customize and populate the names. instead of showing an IDE of the user, that this is being done intentionally.
Agent: Then, number of cases that they're handling, average clicks and average age of the cases, and also a cluster map of the same thing, so that anything over here on the top right is probably not being handled in the right way, because the ideal number of interactions and total time completion should be somewhere over here in the bottom.
Agent: For example, so you're able to do a lot of who with service reps are performing well, with service reps are not performing well, according to how they're working on the case data and trying to cross training.
Agent: I think this would be really relevant for some of your service managers. if they wanted to have that view and know their service reps performance performance around over a period of time.
Agent: Same thing, objects, pages, components, how were they being used and really detailed data around the specific components. And the clicks per record, stall time, time to action, things of that nature that you can track.
Agent: So really useful if you're releasing a new. case Workflow or a new feature out in service or a new feature in your lead to cache process.
Agent: And you're able to see that all my users are doing well till here and then they're jumping out at a certain point in their journey when they're creating a code for example.
Agent: So you're able to track all of that because you have event monitoring data and backing it up.
Agent: That's it for value analytics. That's what the other set of [GPE-5] dashboards that you can get access to.
Agent: Fantastic. Thank you. Of course. Yeah, so I guess that brings us to the end here. Just wanted to ask if there's any other questions or anything else that we could. do as a follow up.
Agent: Okay, and if not, then [PERSON-18] will look forward to one receiving the names on the security side, and then [PERSON-3] and I will double back with you all on field audit and event monitoring to see if that's something that you guys want to move on before [DATE-40].
Agent: But I appreciate your time and and everybody else's time on the call. But thank you very much. Hope you have [DATE-40] and questions.
Speaker 6: Good rest of your day and rest of the
Speaker 5: Let us know if there's any other [EVENT-1]. Thank you.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, the sales representative mentions that they will follow up with the customer regarding field audit and event monitoring to see if it's something they want to move on before a certain date. The customer also asks about implementation services for these products, indicating some level of interest. Overall, the tone of the conversation seems collaborative and focused on finding the best solutions for the customer's needs.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person if they were not.

And how do we analyze those workflows and remove the bottlenecks so people can get things done a lot quicker than before?""
2. ""How are you currently handling data loss prevention in your organization? Are you able to prevent users from exporting reports with sensitive information or limiting how much they can export? Are you getting notified if a malicious actor is accessing data through the API?""
3. ""Do you have a current Backup solution in place? How's that working out for you? Is it easy to test and recover data when needed? Are you considering other options as your data grows?""

These questions seemed to engage the customer more because they addressed specific concerns and use cases related to the customer's organization. The sales rep asked about their current practices, potential issues, and possible improvements, which likely prompted the customer to think more about their security and backup strategies.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1. ""I don't know if we'll take [TIME-1] here, but I wanted to really go through this and explain the shared security responsibility model. We'll look at a snapshot of your org and that's your health check as well.""
2. ""Any questions on this agenda before I dig into it here?""
3. ""Is there any other questions [on this health check]?""
4. ""Any thoughts, comments?""

15. ""And then I just wanted to show that [the value analytics app].""
16. ""Any thoughts, questions and comments around this?""
17. ""If there's any other questions or anything else that we could do as a follow up.""

The sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent, such as their awareness and interest in certain products and features, their thoughts and comments, and their potential consideration of acquiring specific solutions.

video_19766_167_6qr3y000000g6ntAAA,"Speaker 4: No. Oh, you can't really take away, buddy.
Agent: All right. Right into it. Let me just jump over. I was just holding something up here. Share my screen.
Agent: All right.
Agent: How's it looking over there?
Agent: I'm saying good. Perfect. All right, so we'll just kind of take this from a high level, you know, a nice intro into intelligence, you know, formerly noticed data, Rama.
Agent: But essentially, what I'll walk you through [DATE-1] is basically how you can use the platform, how easy it is to not only consume the data and the dashboards and build your own types of reporting, but also how do you connect data sources, you know, how do you integrate those data sources and more importantly, how do you get, your main use case of tying, leads into opportunities and understanding more on the attribution side for where those needs are coming from and how they're progressing through the funnel to close deals and actual close opportunities.
Agent: So I'll walk you through that both from the front end and also kind of a little bit on the technical side to show you how you can do that much more easily in this tool because it's built for this type of Marketing data directly into that kind of [PRODUCT-1] and the different objects you have living there.
Agent: So we'll start out with our visualize section here, talk about dashboard creation and some of the reporting you can generate from this. Then we'll jump over to our [PRODUCT-2] and Mix section.
Agent: So connecting the data using our direct API connectors both in the serum and across, you know, 210 plus other different Marketing types of sources.
Agent: And then we'll talk about how you can get insights and take action from this, jump into our analyze and ask section, I put [PERSON-1] and [ORG-1] and machine learning, some of the really cool things we have specific to [PRODUCT-3] intelligence here.
Agent: So starting out here, you can see in this particular dashboard, I kind of just tethered around and that a little bit, but just wanted to pick one brand just to kind of work with here.
Agent: Talk about what you can expect once the state is coming together, but show you how we're pulling a data from all over the Marketing ecosystem.
Agent: So whether it's hard art, [PRODUCT-3] for email and engagement, all the way through to [PRODUCT-1] for understanding the known individuals and leads.
Agent: All that data is going to be flowing in here to populate what we understand about our customers and that journey.
Agent: And so being able to track lead generation to our goals, so understanding we can set up goals and benchmarks, see how we're pacing to those goals, not only on lead generation, but actually progressing those leads through different stages in the Marketing cycle.
Agent: So qualified to sales qualified, all the way through to deals close and new customers.
Agent: And along those paths, obviously wanting to attribute whether the actual costs require and move those individuals through the entire funnel and what that can take here.
Agent: So you can see calculations here below each of these different widgets understanding, how are we hitting our goals, but also what's the cost to generate these [ORG-2], these [ORG-2], and these ultimate close customers as acquisition costs here.
Agent: And that's obviously in order to get that type of calculation, you need to compile that data from all of your, you know, page channels so everywhere we're actually marketing.
Agent: So it's spending money and acquiring these customers all the way through to the opportunities themselves. And so we start to pull in that data to understand, you know, what is the total cost that actually acquire these individuals.
Agent: And so we can generate ROI type metrics.
Agent: And so if I scroll down, you can see a couple other widgets here, like, you know, total media spin here on the right, uh, with certain goals and trying to see tracking that over time.
Agent: Also Revenue goals, so we're getting our Revenue or sales goals when it comes to actually closing new accounts and new loans, whatever it may be.
Agent: We can actually see that and tie that indirectly into either [PRODUCT-1] or other financial systems and have that data aggregated here as well. And then being able to actually view the entire funnel.
Agent: So I'm going to see maybe an omni-channel view of what's driving the most leads, maybe what my acquisition costs are in each of those channels. And that's where we can get that complete Marketing funnel breakdown by channel here.
Agent: So our total spend. leads generated and being able to see those moving through the funnel, through qualified leads, to opportunities all the way through to actually close customers here.
Agent: And you can see with some of these, obviously there may be more channels you're operating in. If you're using affiliates and partners as one channel, possibly you get to you, here's webinars and events inbound marketing.
Agent: So people are coming to you directly or contacting your sales teams through direct phone numbers with your website. That might be a channel. Obviously email, media, all those can be broken down in different hierarchies.
Agent: So if I have lots of different paid media channels, I want to understand [ORG-3] versus maybe LinkedIn or Twitter or X, I can do that and break that down and get a full granular view of my funnel as well.
Agent: And then here on the right, you can see our Einstein Marketing insights are actually going to be sprinkled throughout the demo on the platform here [DATE-1].
Agent: So essentially with [PERSON-1], it's looking through all of the Marketing data that's flowing into the system and looking for opportunities to optimize.
Agent: So in this case, you know, this particular, you know, event channel, we have higher conversion rates through our events in [LOC-1].
Agent: And this might be pulling in segments from [PERSON-2] or other places where you're doing supplementation. We can start to build in those dimensions so [PERSON-1] can understand all the different permutations and combinations. to offer insights.
Agent: And I'll touch on the Einstein Marketing insights in a moment when I jump over to our Analyze and Act section so you can deploy these, build these out pretty easily and use [PERSON-1] to your advantage to really surface and find those kind of diamonds in a rough And then this is showing kind of a direct [PRODUCT-4].
Agent: And so you can see here, typically in Marketing data, we're not pulling in individualized data or PII demo, I thought showing you the direct Integration in the [PRODUCT-1] and what you can possibly do might be helpful.
Speaker 5: Per se. But in this
Agent: And so in this case, being able to see all of our prospects that are coming in our leads, attributing engagement scores and grades per se, you can add those in as well.
Agent: Here we can see maybe their last activity coming in from either web analytics data or tracking in through other tools like either personalization or our part at tags.
Agent: Octavey detail so if they download a little white paper or if they interacted with the specific landing page, all that can be pulled in and then you can understand kind of that go that engagement across those leads.
Agent: And that can even be tying into actual sales individuals.
Agent: If you have sales teams that are engaging with the leads, are they engaged?
Agent: Are they how many activities are they logging against, you know, either contacting these individuals to drive them down the funnel?
Agent: And all that can be pulled in directly from activities from [PRODUCT-1] as well.
Agent: And that helps us, you know, with understanding the average, you know, activities that takes the convert, maybe to move them through a funnel and start to understand sales velocity metrics.
Agent: And so you can see some of those in here as well. So we have conversion velocity here, I'll show you that. But also. opportunities all out late here.
Agent: So we can see our top opportunities, forecasting probability, are they open or closed?
Agent: What was the source of those opportunities coming from the original campaign source?
Agent: And we have those overlaid as well.
Agent: And then below that, here's our conversion velocity.
Agent: How long is it taking us to convert leads into qualified leads or leads all the way to customers?
Agent: And so getting them, you know, closed in [DATE-2] since you can track, you know, the time it takes.
Agent: Obviously, that's helpful to understand not only how long it typically takes, but maybe how you can, you know, speed that up and understanding that maybe you have higher value opportunities if you close them within [DATE-3] or make sure you contact them within [TIME-1] of them becoming a lead.
Agent: All that data can be analyzed here in intelligence.
Agent: And see we're tracking conversion velocities here. And then lastly, on this view, I want to show you are spinning our why by opportunity. So here I can go in and see specific opportunities we have.
Agent: See the spin we have against those accounts, the overall ROI, and against the opportunity value and kind of overlay that on a bubble chart here.
Agent: So we can quickly identify what our top opportunities are, information about them, understanding, you know, we turn on investment as far as what Marketing efforts went into acquiring those opportunities.
Agent: Right, any questions so far?
Agent: What you're saying?
Speaker 5: Regarding the [ORG-4], our businesses, we went away from that and we just kind of have leads and then opportunities after the opportunity, we've brick that out of them into stages.
Agent: So
Speaker 5: I'm just kind of wondering, would that be something that you can add into here as opposed to, because there are some sales funnels kind of as multiple steps as opposed to, just the SQL, you know what bit more robust.
Agent: I mean?
Agent: It's a little Great question. Yeah, so this is just pretty generic. You can define exactly what those stages are.
Agent: So your funnel up here would be specific to exactly how you want to track those leads all the way through if they're being tied to opportunities or accounts. All that can be defined.
Agent: And so if it's It's not associated with the lead record. Maybe you create an opportunity much earlier in the process. And then we have those opportunity stages that we can track.
Agent: And so those can be the measurement as well for those kind of divergent velocity metrics.
Speaker 5: Ok. Got it.
Agent: So there's in the data model specifically, and I'll touch on this in a moment, there's specific kind of buckets and taxonomies and hierarchies in the data model for not only the leads, objects, but also the opportunities object, the account object.
Agent: For those types of transitions.
Agent: So building off of modified dates or stage dates that they actually change and we can track that and get, obviously, it's all there's all time stamps and all that can be analyzed here within the platform with the little effort overall.
Speaker 5: Okay.
Agent: And you can see here if I kind of click into some of these so I can go into one of these widgets, you can see if I click on it, I have the ability to see all the different dimensions I have here.
Agent: If I want to add additional measurements, I can go in and add a field and see all my different measurements all bucketed nicely based on, you know, the types of data I have in the data model.
Agent: I can change out if I want to make this into a visualization or pivot table or change out how this looks and feels.
Agent: Really simple, everything in this dashboard is drag and drop, really simple to use for business users. So there's no coding, it's all clicks, type editing .
Agent: And if I want to add a new widget, just click a plus button here. I can select what type of widget I want to add here. Maybe I want to do a [DATE-4] time comparison chart or table.
Agent: I can do that really quickly, add that in, add in my measurements. Let's see if I want to do ROI or spend over time, see that how that looks over month.
Agent: And then I can get that change driver here, and then I can make that widget a little bigger. So I can see. This are average ROI. It's down [PERCENT-1] from [DATE-5], wherever it may be.
Agent: You can really quickly and easily edit these, change out how they look and feel all with [ORG-5] code.
Agent: So I just want to show you how easy it is to edit these dashboards, build out reports that are specific to your business very quickly, and also go in and define your metrics pretty easily.
Agent: If say I'm an admin, so this is something that just be reserved for sister admin, I can go and say, you know what, we don't need to do lead spend.
Agent: I'm going to go in here and change out how we calculate this measurement. I can do that directly from the dashboard layer, but this is really I can go in and add in my own inputs and aggregation functions.
Agent: I have the entire data model and all these different function variables here directly from the data model. So I don't have to actually write code. I can just go in and select here.
Agent: I want to add in an exponent trend line with this function. Really, really flexible as far as what you can build out here and then save these as new
Speaker 5: Metrics and calculated measurements.
Agent: Okay. All right. Just want to give you another flavor of another dashboard.
Agent: This is a little more round banking, so it's not going to be as relevant, but just understanding if I'm tracking, you know, new loan applications or pre-qualified individuals coming in that are high quality lead.
Agent: I have all that kind of viewed here with my data looking at my total Revenue year over year, mark an ROI, mark an urban revenue.
Agent: Adways, Marketing spend, all those types of kind of high value Marketing metrics I want to track to make sure my Marketing is healthy I'm optimizing along the way and that includes understanding your segments and audiences.
Agent: So pulling in different audiences It's maybe you know different approval rates based on what channel they're coming in from maybe you get higher value leads from facebook Not so high From maybe [ORG-6] whatever it may be we'll be able to identify that so you can get focused and reallocate your budget more effectively to drive those high values
Agent: Lots of different options. You can hear some of our other Marketing insights here around maybe we want to analyze our emails.
Agent: What's the best subject line against certain audiences?
Agent: Here's what audiences abandoning applications at a higher lower rate. Another ad insight.
Agent: You know lots of options on how you can play insights, but just being able to have that data all in one place allows for that type of real-time [ORG-7], so every day I can go in and say hey these are the levers I can pull to actually optimize Because we looked at all the different permutations the data We're able to identify exactly what channel has the highest ROI based on spins and allocations [DATE-6] in real-time
Speaker 5: Yeah, so there's no issue. I guess this is built for that rather like for marking cloud because that's kind of where we're having issues right now.
Speaker 5: You guys have some very data on the light packaging for [PRODUCT-3] and so it just doesn't translate over to a lot of the [PRODUCT-1] analytics. I can't really funnel a
Agent: Lot of that data over. Yeah, it's a very restricted data model. What we give you in Marketing Cloud is very specific to email and engagement and the channels within Marketing cloud, because that's kind of the data that's available.
Agent: To be able to expand that to other channels or do a little bit more complex type of aggregations from [PRODUCT-1], it just requires a much broader data model for that type of data.
Agent: And so in order to basically cut out the implementation, portion of that, we had to cut out some of those pieces for the Marketing Cloud portion that you're using now. So either the free or advanced reporting directly there.
Agent: So we get just stated up immediately. But when it comes to tying in some of the [PRODUCT-1] nuances, there's obviously every CRM Implementation is different.
Agent: So we provide all the different objects in the data model, and then we'll help you during Implementation to make sure we map in what's important, just like you said.
Agent: You track most of the opportunity stages, not necessarily all the lead stages. That's something that we can just make sure we map in appropriately during setup.
Speaker 5: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah. This basically opens up. Everything.
Agent: You would help with the setup?
Agent: Our team or we have really great Implementation partners that we work with that are really nice packages where they can go in and set up all of your [PRODUCT-1] data to report
EndUser: Perfectly with your [PRODUCT-1] data. media buy and add data here. I was surprised to hear you saying salesforce would do that. I didn't think salesforce
Agent: Did implementations. We do. We're not always the lowest cost, and so we give you lots of options. So there's, we have a really great team that can do implementations. It just depends on the use cases.
Agent: We specialize in certain implementations, you know, more so than others, and it's usually more economical to go with one of our partners that is in our kind of ecosystem there.
Agent: All right, so you're seeing some of the options here as far as how you can set up some of your visualizations for the kind of executive reporting.
Agent: But here, just getting a full, you know, all your different channels in one place, understanding how much it takes to actually market and spend and acquire, you know, actually closed loan or a closed deal here.
Agent: So, and then you could set up, you know, whether we're going to start with site visit all the way through to getting them qualified, started the application, maybe they're contacted by, you know, Sales rep or whatever, maybe an advisor, and then actually getting them to close.
Agent: So all the different stages usually come from different data sources. So this is really aggregating all that together so you get that complete
Agent: View. Then obviously because we're tying in directly to the platforms themselves, we can actually pull in the creatives. So you have different creatives you're running on different platforms.
Agent: You can see those directly from those platforms and actually be able to see which creatives are more effective without having to go into those platforms and see it there. So I can quickly pivot between all my different channels.
Agent: See my campaign performance across each of these channels.
Agent: How many loans is it driving?
Agent: Maybe we're looking for cross-sell opportunities. Those are total spend. And so lots of lots of different options. We can see all the different channels that we can tie into.
Agent: So that includes if you're doing direct mailers or offline content, do lead buys, you know, with partners, all that data can be broken down. So you have all the different filters and breakdowns to analyze.
Agent: A little deeper funnel and then obviously geo based type of overlays, you can go filter by states and by region
Speaker 5: Their [ORG-8]'s, all that right in the data model out of the box.
Agent: All right, so any questions about the visualization side or any of the reporting before I
Speaker 5: Jump into how we connect to the data and really set this up and how we can scale with you?
Speaker 5: Yeah, the visualization, I mean, that makes sense.
Agent: I'm so curious How about the everything gets pushed in so yeah, I'm ready.
Agent: Okay Nice, so let's show me the back and I'm gonna jump over to connect the mix And this is really the iceberg piece that's under the water. This is really the real value of this solution.
Agent: It's all in the back end. It's the out of the box marking data model. It's these 210 plus API connectors that are ready to go. And that's where we start with.
Agent: So the quickest way to get data into the platform is just utilize one of our pre-built APIs. Each one of these is pre-mapped, ready to go from each of these sources.
Speaker 5: But any data
Agent: That we don't have as an API available, we can easily pull it in. We're completely data agnostic. We don't just work with [ORG-9] systems or just some of the ad tech.
Agent: We have a proprietary connector we call Total Connect, which allows you to basically map in any data from anywhere and automate that entire process.
Agent: That can be as simple as having an email directly into the platform with a specific email, and then it comes in processes that data when it gets a new email.
Agent: Or it could be landing it in a, [FAC-1] or into a [ORG-10] environment or a big snowflake environment, whatever it may be, this can find that and see it refresh and then process it into the data model.
Agent: So Total Connect is very powerful and allows you full control over the entire mapping process of that data as well. So I love Total Connect.
Agent: It's the reason I moved over to help sell this tool because it was far superior as far as implementing quickly, getting data stood up and scaling as you want to add new data or try out new channels and new Marketing tactics.
Speaker 5: All with the power of this tool.
Speaker 5: Is that more like a data engineer type of tool, or is that, again, marketing, clicks, no code?
Agent: Like, who's the audience for that one?
Agent: Yes, sometimes, you know, it's interesting. Sometimes if I say I'm connecting in, let's just use an example, [ORG-10] data, it's a little more complex.
Agent: I have a lot of these different triggers in the analytics that I want to pull in and map into the data model. I can use the out of the box API data sets from [ORG-15].
Agent: So my web analytics data just perfectly mapped in. I have country coming in, mapping and normalizing here and intelligence to country, bounces all the typical just out of the box type of metrics I would for my web analytics.
Agent: But other times, I have a lot more customization on my [ORG-15] analytics that I want to do.
Agent: And so instead of just using the out of the box mappings that are just kind of simple to set up, I will actually use Total Connect for that. And.
Agent: For instance, if I use the, there's another analytics one here that's like custom, we're going into [ORG-13] with really granular data coming from [ORG-15].
Agent: I can go in and I'm actually going to be using the mapping engine and total connect to do that.
Agent: And so for the technical folks that will probably watching this later on in the recording, I'll show you kind of how it works. It's pretty simple.
Agent: I can either just go connect into one of our technical environments to pull that table and that data in, or I can just go browse here and I'm going to go, your friend wants to just pop up.
Agent: I'm just going to pull a sample data set here just to show you how it comes together. You can find something quickly here.
Agent: Okay. Just another table that's called [ORG-10]. I think it's pretty generic. Looks like it. Okay, so now I have just a table that I just pulled in from my desktop, but it recognizes the column headers.
Agent: It recognizes what, you know, if they are a dimension or text or if they are a metric.
Agent: So, [NORP-1] and [ORG-16] conversions is, sees it as a number, revenue, conversion tag name, you know, tag key, and knows it's gonna be text. So all these are now getting ready to be mapped in.
Agent: I just want to quickly see this. I can even throw in transformers in the data. If the data is, I need to make some changes before I even get to the mapping screen.
Agent: But this is the first step in getting that data in. Click Next. It's going to analyze it. It's going to hopefully see that as probably adds data. But this is where the machine learning looks through all the data.
Agent: It looks at the column headers to see what data model type it may be. So it knows if the hierarchy is in the fusion that's going to make into the model. Okay, conversion tag, that works, we found that.
Agent: So now here on the left, I have my external data objects, so all the different fields coming in. And then it's showing how it's actually connecting and mapping into the data model.
Agent: So it's using our conversion tag, data stream type.
Agent: You can see here all the different data stream types that it may be better to, you know, conversion type of keywords, little less with ads because there was an actual ads data in there.
Agent: You can see all different kind of data stream types that it's looking for and how those relate to each other in the data model.
Agent: So you can go in and select, if I know this is [ORG-14], I would just select that, I can explore that. You'll see there's data model types for messaging, free commerce, or product data.
Agent: You'll see some down here for [PRODUCT-1], which is very unique. CRM data and [PRODUCT-1] leads data. So I click in here.
Agent: It says don't do that, but you can see more details exactly how it matches up and what you use that for. I'm going to send over some help docs after this.
Agent: Just you can explore the different data model streampipes when you're looking at how you map in CRM data, just to understand how we make those fusions to leads and [PRODUCT-1] objects like opportunities and how they move through different process stages.
Agent: We can track those. We're just going to show you how this works. We map it and you can easily unmap things. I can change out the model field that it's going into and change up the name.
Agent: If I want to change up the actual name of the data model field here, I can even add in formulations in here. out for this one because it's a key.
Agent: But if I go in and, for instance, conversion tag name, click in here, I can add in processing formulas. I can actually throw in and say, this is a tag name.
Agent: I want to pin this with a certain code. I can do that here with different functions and see the entire data model not have to actually Code it.
Agent: I can throw in and if you can see, it actually starts to have help with the coding anyway.
Speaker 5: So does this allow you to take two different data silos and then put them together with a primary key and just say, hey, this is, you know, our unique key for both of them is going to be the email address and then be able to create different types of visualization if you can join the two?
Agent: That's exactly what this is doing. So it identified that there is a media buy key in this data. So that's already keying up for aggregation purposes right there. And there's a conversion tag key in this data set.
Agent: And so it's doing that aggregation against those keys, whatever that key may be. And the media side, it's different than obviously known data, like when you have an email address. So that's different.
Agent: But yeah, it's going to use that key and help with aggregation for the kind of data model hierarchies.
Speaker 5: Ok. Yeah, I'm thinking like adding an additional data set, not just two, but having maybe like three.
Agent: That's basically what this is doing. So as you add additional data streams, each one of these is going to be their own data stream.
Agent: And so before I leave here, I'll show you kind of this finishing out this one.
Agent: But if I go here, if I want to automate the data refresh, I can set it up where that specific email can be how we get the data in, it'll be through FTP or SFTP a direct port that you could go through.
Speaker 5: Right here. It could be
Agent: And then I can also decide how often I want to refresh or how I want to refresh it. So if I go into the advanced tab here, I can see my load mode.
Agent: So if I want to do a full replace of this entire data set, I can do that, or that's a total replace here.
Agent: Or I can just replace based on date, or do up search or incremental, and then even add data load rules as well.
Agent: So maybe I want to say, I want a different data stream to load before this one comes in or create parent-child relationships, all that here in the advanced tab. So.
Agent: Really a lot of flexibility on how you decide to load that data. But when it comes to aggregating multiple data sources, that is really the power of this tool overall.
Agent: Every data stream that we set up, my data streams list are going to be flowing. I can see how many rows of data came in, when it last processed, I get a full counting of everything that's happening.
Agent: So historical record of every time a process is.
Agent: I'll get as every day this reruns, I'll get a whole list of this and I can see, the log of how it processed, I can actually download both the original file and any transform file.
Agent: So there's any transformations that took place and do that. And here I can reprocess it or rerun it really quickly.
Agent: But as we add additional data streams, it's going to be aggregating against all those different data model entities that you just saw on the right. And you know, as I add in.
Agent: You know, related type of data sets, that makes sense. Or if I'm doing kind of more custom data sets using Total Connect, you can decide and have full control over the aggregation of the data model.
Speaker 5: What keys you're aggregating to Okay, cool.
Agent: So for instance, like if it's a social, you know, ad channel, [ORG-3] ads and Twitter ads and LinkedIn ads, all going to have a similar kind of normalized data model set that it's going to be aggregating to.
Agent: So the campaign name is, you know, is aggregated and it's all normalized too. So you're normalizing it all so you have it all being combined in the right way.
Agent: And I'll show you in a second how that looks when it starts flowing into the model.
Agent: But just wanna show you all the different connectors we have, every one of these is unique as far as how the data comes in and maps.
Agent: So if I'm pulling in, let's say, Pinterest, that's a random one, but I'll just click on it because it's there. I can see all the data set exactly how Pinterest is going to map into intelligence in the model.
Agent: Or [ORG-16] or [ORG-14] ads or whatever it may be. All of them have different types of unique kind of mappings. And so and that involves commerce vendors. I have lots of different flat file types that can pull in.
Agent: So if you get your reporting maybe with an agency you work with in a PDF every [DATE-7], we can even pull in that and map it in. They can email it directly or process it into a data stream.
Agent: And then the same thing, we can go directly to any of these technical then there's a data warehouse partners and find those tables, map them directly in for what's relevant for the reporting here.
Agent: Ok, great. All right. And so once that comes in, this is kind of a visualizer to see how it starts to aggregate. So I can see all my sources here on the left.
Agent: And kind of scroll down and see how it's being bucketed together. So I can see how all [ORG-19] is flowing in.
Agent: Or if I want to say, hey, where's all my campaign information coming in?
Agent: I can hover over here and see all different sources feeding and campaign and aggregating to all these different dimensions. You can span that to all the different dimensions. I can see, you know, deliverability.
Agent: I can see the delivery here. You'll see all the different metrics that are coming in. So if I want to have a normalized click, so click is a click across all the different.
Agent: You know, tools, but when it comes to social, maybe an engagement, like a like or, you know, a heart, whatever, maybe on these different platforms, it's a little different.
Agent: So it doesn't actually match up, but in here, it's going to match up and be normalized so you get that nice aggregation.
Agent: And here I can always search the data model to fine fields, but this is where it's all being neatly organized for you and a quick way to just find where that is coming from, what you have available, and how it's being aggregated.
Agent: All right, so and that also applies, at least if I have any harmonization scenario. So we also have a tool called [ORG-16] that does pattern recognition.
Agent: So if you have naming conventions that have a lot of different pieces of information that we want to break out for reporting, we can see those patterns in the naming conventions, create a pattern recognition, and from there we'll be able to see that data coming in and grade it as it comes in to see if your different Marketing teams are following the naming convention rules or the taxonomies that you've set up.
Agent: And so you don't have a lot of downtime and missing data.
Agent: So as a data admin, I can go in here and have a full view of everything that's happening, have a area where I can fix and maintain any better demo for this in my second. Let me get you.
Agent: So a better demo.
Agent: I meant to have this up so I want to find the support you guys, [FAC-2].
Agent: Okay, so I wanted some data in here. Here we go. So this is what it looks like when you actually have some patterns set up.
Agent: So in this case, if I have, you know, certain campaigns command, I have my ads, media buy names all set up.
Agent: It's going to see the kind of single cell of data that has all those different pieces into it. So maybe the, add itself, the name of the ad, the size of the targeted audience, the type of ad.
Agent: What product we're pushing, all that information in one cell usually comes in on the table. We then can see that we break it out into their own dimensions automatically so we have those filters right in place.
Agent: So I can select, I want to set it up, maybe this is the kind of the one I want to go with and then I'm going to go in and I'm going to say exactly how I want to position this in the data model, my data model fields.
Agent: And then from then on it's actually going to, it's going to grade the data as it flows in. So I can see that.
Agent: Of my data are here in this case, is fitting the data model and the harmonized the engines I have set up.
Agent: And [PERCENT-2] are actually fitting my data classification rules, because this is where they can manage those as well.
Agent: So if I have something like abbreviations for states where we're targeting individuals, I can expand that to the actual name of the state with a classification rule, or we have product codes, and we want to make those actual product names and reporting.
Agent: That's what I can use data classification rules for. That's really powerful and makes it a lot easier.
Agent: So you don't have to have perfectly clean data starting out or go back and reprocess the data if it doesn't fit those rules.
Agent: We can do it all in here and then use this to fix and maintain any gaps. So if somebody actually missed traffic's a campaign without filling in all the different naming convention rules we have in place.
Agent: We can go into the data set and actually fix it here in the UI. So in this case, it shows me everything that needs fixing.
Agent: Somebody forgot to put the placement objective, but we got campaign name, the video by name, all those other pieces in there. I can go in and just, you know, maybe this is an acquisition campaign.
Agent: And I want to just copy that and put that in because the entire table should be that, save it. And now we've updated the table and now we don't have to go back to the source and do that.
Agent: And that should be [PERCENT-3] for that one. So as a data admin, if you work in the data a lot, this is a real headache. It takes a lot of time to do this typically.
Agent: And it actually results in a lot of gaps in the reporting. You have a lot of missing data that you can't get that full picture.
Agent: This is where you can have full management over that and really give more trust for the data to the stakeholders actually they can actually use without having those gaps.
Agent: Any questions on [ORG-16]?
Speaker 5: That's very interesting stuff. It's
Agent: Great. Awesome. All right, so let me go back here. I'll just fix a main team. Also here, when I was, let me just stick around here. This is where you can manage all of your dimensions.
Agent: You can calculate a dimension or custom dimensions, but we give you all the standard dimensions out of the box.
Agent: I can explore all those and see all the different ways of breaking down the data, but just lots of different options and here obviously the same thing with the measurements list.
Agent: We have our standard out-of-the-box measurements for all the different types of data we're pulling in, but then we have calculated measurements where you can go in and maybe you have a different way to calculate cost or ROI and you want to create multiple calculated measurements for that, you can do that here and manage all those here as well.
Agent: All right, now let's pivot over to our Analyze and Act section. And this is where we have our Einstein Marketing insights. And so basically, you can use [PERSON-1] to optimize towards any rate-based metric.
Agent: So anything that we can measure as a metric coming in over a certain time, we can help you optimize based on all the different dimensions in the data.
Agent: So for instance, we have a few different bots kind of set up here that are running. We have one that's looking to optimize our cost per lead.
Agent: Some looking to increase our conversion rates, return on ad spin, click the rates. But when I want to create a new bot, it's as simple as just selecting the KPI.
Agent: So all the different metrics I have in the data model, these could be your own custom calculated metrics you've set up as well. And you select that metric.
Agent: So maybe I want to look at my cost per, let's see. I have a new video campaign. I want to get my video completion rate up.
Agent: I can just save and run that and have it just kind of look at all the dimensions and automatically pick those for me.
Agent: Or I can go even deeper and say, you know what, I want to get a very, you know, granular accounting of this campaign [DATE-8].
Agent: I need a day over day analysis and then choose exactly which dimensions I wanted to analyze. So here it's using [PERSON-1] selected dimensions. So kind of the standard ones we have in the model here.
Agent: But you may say, you know what, I only care about the channel and campaign. So let's just focus on that and you can select those and choose those dimensions. So it only runs on those two.
Agent: And so when those have already run, I can show you some kind of samples here for looking at click-the-rate for instance.
Agent: This is going to look at historical click-the-rate over time, so we get a kind of full accounting of our click-the-rate and how it's averaging.
Agent: And then what it's going to do is get a run through kind of some of the different models and actually put the most impactful insights at the top.
Agent: So here at the top, we see a very impactful positive insight. So. a specific creative or easy rollover for our [ORG-21] product has [PERCENT-4] above average click-through rate. So that one's working really well.
Agent: This may be one I want to explore and see, maybe we can use those same learnings and figure out maybe which creatives are working well besides easy rollover that we can kind of devote to other products as well.
Agent: But more importantly, the negative ones here. So the second one is our attend webinar landing page in the [LOC-2] region is underperforming by [PERCENT-5]. So something's going wrong in the [LOC-2]. Maybe the content's not relevant.
Agent: Whatever it may be. I can go and explore that. Same with this creative, the spunpiner creative in the [LOC-2] not doing well. So click into one of these.
Agent: And you can see that it looks at all the different creatives across all the different regions. And so lots of different permutations that it's analyzing.
Agent: And this one really sticks out because it is not only down quite a bit percentage. It's a decent chunk over the overall hole. So. accounts for in this case 145 million of our impressions.
Agent: So that's kind of, you know, it's a decent chunk. And it's well below some of these others. So if I click view alternatives here, it'll show me what maybe where to redeploy this creative.
Agent: So this fund finder creative is not working in the [LOC-2] at all. So in the [LOC-2], our local advisor, our wealth planning, white paper, doing well, it's like humanless, working well, uh, fund finder not working.
Agent: So I can actually click in here and say, so all regions, so I want to see which region. this does well. Well, Fund Planner does work well in the [LOC-3] and nationally, just not well in the [LOC-2].
Agent: So maybe just reallocate, get that creative out of the [LOC-2], reallocate budget and maybe keep it nationally and in the [LOC-3].
Agent: But maybe go in and go a little deeper and get into, go back to the dashboard, go into kind of the full kind of pivot table and see exactly what creatives are doing, what, where, get into some of the data.
Agent: But this really just helped me directionally understand what's working, what's not. And I'll get alerts for this over time. So, When I log in, I'll see different insights coming in.
Agent: I can set up an email or [ORG-23] message to come through that tells me, hey, we just found out that this campaign has a really, really high [ORG-23] costs for some reason. This is what we think is happening.
Agent: These creators are really high. Something's going wrong. I can actually set up the tool to pause a poor performing campaign.
Agent: So if I say, hey, if my acquisition costs or my [ORG-23] costs goes [MONEY-1], pause that campaign immediately, send me an alert, give me a notification.
Agent: And then I'll decide when to turn it back on or what's going on.
Agent: And this can save a lot of money, especially if you have a high budget campaign that you're trying to run pretty quickly or it's fast paced.
Agent: Getting those insights as soon as possible allows you to pull those leaders and make those adjustments before it's too late.
Agent: And there's, you know, we have several stories with customers where, you know, one, you know, Marketing channel owner was setting up a campaign, they, that finger, the keyboard, accidentally put an extra zero on a [ORG-3] campaign.
Agent: And within [DATE-9], they're just overspinning their entire budget. They got alerted, they were to go in and pause that. And it saved them over a million dollars over [DATE-10].
Agent: So those types of scenarios are really helpful when you have that data coming in [DATE-10]. But that's where I go in and set up those alerts. And I do that directly from my activation center here.
Speaker 5: And so when you're saying you can pause the campaigns, are you saying there's a direct Integration with
Agent: Any of the ad networks that we have?
Agent: Only a few, but yeah, good question. So right here when I create a new action, I can have it, you know, send a [ORG-23] message. I can set up, you know, Workflow for IFTTT.
Agent: So lots of different options there. [PERSON-3] text message. But with the ad networks, we have, you know, where we can pause or, you know, campaign optimization in [ORG-3], [ORG-3] ads. We have it for [ORG-21] here and for Twitter.
Agent: So those are the three that allow API. you know, pausing of campaigns and ad sets and creatives directly in the platform, but I can use those and take actions directly Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 5: With these connectors here.
Agent: Or if I have, you know, development resources, I can trigger Python scripts, web hooks, simply just send an email, whatever, maybe lots of options and I'm gonna set up action rules for those.
Agent: I just basically say, hey, pick an action, name it. If, you know, I'm gonna send an executive alert, [DATE-6] at [TIME-2] with this dashboard of this information or I want to do it by event.
Agent: I want to say it if
Agent: Our [ORG-23] is greater than or equal to whatever maybe I can find it. It is $[MONEY-2]. And so I can actually see exactly how many results comply with this.
Agent: So luckily none of our [ORG-23] costs have gone [MONEY-3]. but I can view the results. So see when it's actually gonna trigger.
Agent: So I can set up this rule and have it trigger by event, but I don't wanna send a data.
Agent: I wanna have it whenever the data updates and it gets, you know, gets new data, I'm gonna get that alert immediately. So really nice to have these kind of action roles.
Agent: And then I can trigger obviously that Workflow to, you know, pause that campaign if I'd like to. So really, really flexible, really cool. Something very unique to this platform because it's really specific to Marketing and training those types
Speaker 5: Of actions.
Agent: All right, this is also where I can set up my reports. So if I just want to report, I could go out in a number of different formats at any time. I have lots of options there.
Agent: And select the format. I want to excel spreadsheet and I wanted to show the class [DATE-15]. I want to show these measurements. These mentions great exportability here and scheduling of reports to go out.
Agent: That's also good for if you want to extend the data out to other systems or have other teams that are doing some modeling, you can set up curator resports right here that go out and then send to those different locations and it can drop in a number of places.
Agent: If you have [ORG-30] [PRODUCT-5] bucket or any type of data warehousing tools, we can map right here.
Agent: And you'll see, I won't go into all these, but you see, there's pivot tables here on the left. We have a query builder too. So we have a platform API and a query API.
Agent: So if individuals want to actually query the data set here directly and pull that data out of here without being in the UI, they can use our query API, as well as a Tableau Data Connector and our database export.
Speaker 5: So if you want to do large database exports into [ORG-30] SQL or [ORG-30] environment, we can map in directly to those tables that are doing the database.
Agent: So let me ask you something regarding [PERSON-4], because that's kind of what we're using right now.
Agent: Does this replace [PERSON-4]?
Agent: In some use cases, I would say it can, but typically it's a better together story. A lot of users are really good in [PERSON-4]. They like to build out reports in [PERSON-4].
Agent: However, the data modeling, the data connectivity is just a lot more work in [PERSON-4] with Dataprep. And so this can sometimes help them with the Dataprep and the data piping.
Agent: Getting all that data aggregated and put in the right location. So you can set those [PERSON-4] dashboards on top.
Agent: So we have a lot of customers that use this for the data piping side of it, really getting that data together and then [PERSON-4] users build dashboards and reports on top of that.
Agent: Some, you know, some Marketing users prefer our visualization others prefer to live in [PERSON-4]. So we give them the option.
Agent: And the nice thing is we can both, you know, drop, you know, full data sets for [PERSON-4] to access with, you know, both a push.
Speaker 5: Or they can be in [PERSON-4] and pull directly from the data model here. So I can live in [PERSON-4] and query the data model directly from [PERSON-4] to build out my reports.
Speaker 5: Is that connected part of the package or is that looking great?
Speaker 5: It's part of it comes
Agent: With every license.
Agent: So they're kind of using this as a luck and data prep?
Agent: Exactly.
Agent: Yes, because it has the API connectivity, it has the data model all ready to go, it's being aggregated and modeled, and so they get their master Marketing data record that they can use and put that to other business data across the enterprise.
Agent: So it's really for other data modeling teams really rich Marketing data set directly.
Speaker 5: To be able to have access to this Okay, thanks.
Agent: All right, so I'm going to jump over to our marketplace. And this is really a pretty cool area where you can actually install apps on [DATE-13] with the tool.
Agent: So you really get value right off the bat with, you know, intelligence. We have a number of free apps ready to go in here specific to, you know, you know, very specific Marketing use cases.
Agent: So out of the box reporting and actual insights and intelligence directly in these apps.
Agent: Some of those might be for just cross-channel paid use cases where I have all of my paid channels in one place, optimization, all neatly organized, and it's easy to use at format.
Agent: So I can see all my [ORG-21] Ads campaigns, all my different metrics, all in one place. I can see timelines.
Agent: I can see how all these different paid campaigns are overlapping, how they're driving performance, but also get insights here. It's my worst, best campaigns. Get some Einstein insights. I mean, that's how to optimize.
Agent: So that's just one of the apps that are just free. You can install on [DATE-13]. But others like our lead generation [ORG-33] monitor, this ties in your [PRODUCT-1] data right away. So map it into those [PRODUCT-1] objects.
Agent: And so I can see how I'm generating leads, what sources they're coming in from, who's working them, their statuses all coming in from [PRODUCT-1], tied in with some of our Marketing media data here as well.
Agent: And so I can just install this app, put it in a collection in the visualization side. So I can see what salespeople are working with leads, how they're being worked, without having to build a custom dashboard from scratch.
Agent: And so just having some lists ready to go, even with some of their, are kind of lead to sales funnel by channel.
Agent: So some of this is a little more B2B focused on this one, but being able to see just how we're qualifying leads, converting and closing them, cohort analysis, how long it's taking to actually convert them by creation date or by source here.
Agent: And so just giving you some great out of the box visualizations.
Agent: And so that's our lead generation. Same thing, we have a sales pipeline. So marking insights for sales cloud. This one's a little more about Revenue and the associated kind of funnel. So let's see here.
Agent: Oh, this one is long, break it down. So we get some money here, here we go. So campaigns, spin, you know, cost per lead, qualified leads.
Agent: So kind of what we saw is on that first dashboard but in an app form, kind of showing it through the funnel [DATE-10].
Agent: So lots of nice visualizations here and giving you some insights here at the bottom kind of where you can optimize what's working, what's not.
Speaker 5: Can you can you share me that attribution on?
Agent: I think it's right below it right here. Yes. So this multi-touch attribution app, it's there's a caveat to this one. So this is a kind of a wizard based install app. Once we have the data staged and ready.
Agent: You know, basically at the individual level.
Agent: So this is taking marking, cloud, subscriber IDs, all staged, tying together all those different touch points, and then we set this app on top to build out some of the visualizations for that.
Agent: So it does require our granular data center for storing all that individualized granular data for, you know, for this kind of multi-touch attribution. I actually have it, I think I had it set up here. It is here.
Agent: So, so when this, this app basically generates different models. You can have up to seven different models based on last touch, first touch, linear. You can do a weighted kind of average on these different touch points.
Agent: But once we have that data staged, we can see across all your first party channels.
Agent: So email, SMS, push, CRM data, all that to understand how many touch points it takes to convert, what's the revenue, average time to convert. We can break that down by sources and campaigns.
Agent: And for instance, you can see here by scroll down, kind of the campaign interactions.
Agent: So they got an email and then they came in through search and then interacted with our next campaign all through kind of the journey process, what we can attribute on a last touch type of conversion event to those different touch points.
Agent: And so that's something we help you set up once we have the data kind of structured in that way. So it's across that unified ID using subscriber ID and Marketing cloud. If you have an ID unification
Speaker 5: Kind of set up now or you're looking at other channels that you have ideas that you can match up, we can tie that in here so you can get kind of a more complete picture for multi-touch networks.
Speaker 5: So, hey, team, that kind of just goes into the idea of using a lot of. So having that persistent ID across
Agent: Every channel, it sounds like that to be mapped in here. And then we could maybe use something like this if we structure the data correctly.
Agent: That's exactly right. So whether you're using CPA or tools that do that unification, the nice thing is it's what's at the end of stage. I already did that. OK, well, me install it.
Agent: You go through a wizard process, you say, you know, these are my channels. This is my conversion events. These are the different models. Like you can see a little bit of that.
Agent: What's my look back window?
Agent: Maybe you want to look at look at [DATE-15] or I've got a really long sales cycle. Maybe when I go back [DATE-16], you know, from an initial touch point.
Agent: So you can kind of choose those options and then we'll generate different dashboards.
Speaker 5: But now all that data is going to be staged so you can actually have in the model. I can go and build out dashboards solely based on. all different touch points and interactions across all of our different channels.
Speaker 5: That's awesome.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-5] just put that on that one just like if we don't really know, let's just say a non-branded lead that comes in could take [DATE-14] and if it does to us, it doesn't work, but maybe it's just a longer lead just because [ORG-21] doesn't tell us it's working.
Speaker 5: It sounds like this might be able to tell us and go set an insight.
Agent: Yep, we'll kind of store that data even from [ORG-21] in that data center.
Speaker 6: So you have a much longer, you know, tail for kind of doing that type of analysis. And I'll assume it's, we're still hampered in pushing that back into [ORG-21] ads on storing it.
Agent: [DATE-16] because there might be a window even if you're If we're retargeting purposes.
Speaker 6: I just for, I, it's basically just for like credit,
Agent: I guess, is easiest way to say it, maybe not the most clear. Yeah, if you're doing that analysis in [ORG-21], I guess.
Agent: But ideally you'd be doing that, you know, that attribution credit from [ORG-21] as a channel in this tool or in [PERSON-4] or others with now you have that data stage, you have it stored, you can do a lot more deeper analysis on, you know, crediting it unless there's something as far as if you're doing credit
Speaker 6: To pay, you know, affiliates or partners for, you know, the leads you, you get from whatever it may be. use cases that way.
Agent: All right, so awesome questions. I know now I kind of got to the end here, but you can see somebody other options here. We have, you know, search keyword insights.
Agent: We're, you know, search engine marketing, Marketing cloud, email engagement, cross journey analysis, understanding send times and when's the best time, really cool apps that you can just use and install, all based on these different types of data sources.
Agent: So I hope you can see here how this tool is just really built for marketers to, you know, get value very quickly. And that's, you know, cross emails and journeys.
Agent: And having all that data flowing in, getting nice visualizations that I understand, what's, I click the open rate and my best email, and when do I
Speaker 5: Send that, all that kind of built directly into an app here. You can see subject line analysis.
Speaker 5: So it sounds like to me like we, essentially if we have a subscriber ID, in marking cloud that if they finally go through and end up as a closed one, we can store that and then just kind of use that as an attribution point.
Speaker 5: So we're kind of, we're failing at that format right now because we're using some different metrics for first and last touch. But if we have their ID, it's not like we can kind of stitch it together.
Agent: Yeah, so anything that's first party, when you're looking at third party like. [ORG-21], for instance, or [ORG-3], until they actually pass through and click through and interact with one of your first party properties, it's going to be opaque.
Agent: You're not going to have that data. But once they interact and they feel out of lead form, obviously, or anything like that, then you can start to tie that together.
Agent: So you're not going to get at the impression level. There's a lot of blockage when it comes to data from those tools.
Agent: But as far as once they interact with your first party properties that have your own tags and your own cookies, we can get that data in and start to match it up.
Speaker 5: Okay, great. Thanks.
Agent: This won't be very clear because multi-touch attribution, it's a lot of different things, a lot of different people.
Agent: And it's not as easy as it used to be because there's just so many cookie blockers in browsers now after [DATE-14] or blocking cookies in some cases.
Agent: So just being able to get that data store and then use it to tell that long tail story is kind of where we're focusing.
Agent: You've noticed like the [ORG-28]'s and the big attribution players have gone by the waysang [DATE-19] or two just because they can't gather that same data that those cookies can't fire.
Agent: And so we're having to kind of use solely first party data to tell that story versus third party data.
Agent: All right, so that's all I had for [DATE-16]. You guys can see this filter here, lots of options with data dictionary, media name builders, lots of tools in here.
Agent: We have smart lenses data sources that really nice visualizations and dashboards ready to go with those data sources connected, but, All you need is your admin credentials for these data sources and everything flows in.
Speaker 5: For specific
Agent: It's really, really nice to scale that up, add your data stats and then For the [PRODUCT-1] side, there'll be a little bit of setup, just the map and what's relevant to you and kind of custom for your CRM instance.
Agent: But getting to this view of understanding where the leads are coming from, how what the opportunity value is, how much do you spend to acquire them, all that is really what this tool is made to do to get all that data aggregated and collected in the kind of format to do that type of analysis.
Agent: So lots of reuse case, if you have other ideas you want to explore. I'd love to kind of explore
Speaker 5: Those with you, but I appreciate you guys' engagement in all your time, I'm gonna check in the [LOC-4] [DATE-1]. Yeah, thanks. What's the engagement, I mean, the like onboarding time for this, and then also Implementation time,
Agent: Who would have to be involved on our end, and how much time would they need?
Agent: Yeah, so typically, usually just need to assign kind of a project manager that has access to the data.
Agent: So it's really just wrangling credentials, making sure that we can get access to the different data sources and the data sets. And then typically with a partner, usually it's around, I'd say, [DATE-21], depending on the use cases.
Agent: Just getting connected to the data, kind of cadence calls to make sure that they're on track with setting up the dashboards correctly or kind of the reporting that you want.
Agent: So the faster you can understand basically what you want to see as an in-product and then access to the data, collecting those credentials, getting the data owners and the stakeholders all involved early, that helps speed along implementation.
Agent: That's usually the only bottlenecks we have along the way. Thanks. Once we have access and we start getting going, it's pretty quick to start mapping and using that data. And then obviously there's QA.
Agent: We want to make sure that you can trust the data, that you understand that what's what, have a data dictionary there to understand what metrics are what, what dimensions are what, and then train you along the way.
Agent: So the nice thing is we have full [LOC-5] with lots of videos and guided training all available. We have a great help portal with answers almost every question in the platform. And then trailblazer community.
Agent: There's exams and certifications, all kinds of great [PRODUCT-6] that you can use along the way as you're being
Speaker 5: Implemented so you can hit the ground running. What's you basically click go. Got it. Thanks.
Speaker 5: Awesome.
Speaker 4: Any other questions?
Speaker 4: Well, we got [PERSON-6].
Speaker 5: I'm good.
Speaker 4: Yeah, stunned silence. I like it. Perfect. Well, I think from [DATE-9] that was perfect, by the way, five. We're right at right at [TIME-3].
Speaker 4: I think from an extent, for my part, [PERSON-7], I know you weren't talking on it before the call started. I've got everything over to [ORG-34]. I know him and [PERSON-8] I've been kind of chatting with on the side.
Speaker 4: I've been kind of working with you and [PERSON-9] kind of visualized and let you guys see the tool. I don't know.
Speaker 4: Are you guys planning on having a conversation with him at some point [DATE-1] to kind of figure out which direction you guys want to go?
Speaker 4: If there's any other questions we need or just trying to figure out timeline wise what we're looking at.
Speaker 4: That's a loaded question.
Speaker 5: That I'm gonna have to refer to [PERSON-9] on that one. I think those two will probably have to have that final conversation.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Are you giving pretty?
EndUser: Insertion order, a [GPE-1] or
Speaker 4: Whatever it is you're like, not nothing too formal yet. You basically just wanted kind of high level pricing. So I think I had that slide deck.
Speaker 4: I think that I showed you guys at one point, sent that over to him with some high level pricing.
Speaker 4: I told him if he needs to see like more of a formal quote, we can do that because my thought was is that you would want to co term this with the rest of your [PRODUCT-3] contract so that it just kind of assumes that same terms we're not extending you or anything like that or having this via.
Speaker 4: A standalone [DATE-23] contract just for this . just going to throw it on and let it roll with everything else .
Speaker 4: I didn't know if you wanted to talk with wit h pretty about that completely up to you guys on how you want to do that .
Speaker 4: I can get you guys something more formal , copy you both on it so you can take a look and maybe discuss .
EndUser: Yeah, that's fine. But I guess I just that's the question.
EndUser: What's our current contract?
EndUser: What are the dates on it?
EndUser: What are
Speaker 4: We paying?
Speaker 4: Yeah, let me look. Let me swing full that up for you here.
EndUser: I don't have a well, but handy yet.
Speaker 4: I know I probably
Speaker 4: See if I might need to get back to the on totals unless you can bring a lot of things. see here.
Speaker 4: I know date wise, it looks like your contract set to renew on [DATE-23], So if we co-term, the quote for this would basically be co-term but also pro-rated, right?
Speaker 4: So you'd pay from whatever now to [DATE-21] would be to kind of get you to it. It's almost like a like a paying trial until [DATE-21]. Let me see here. Look at the renewal.
Speaker 4: Yeah, let me pull up your renewal. Yeah, that renewal opt-in I think is in [DATE-21]. Yeah, it looks like the renewal is set for [DATE-23], and it's $[MONEY-4]. That's the whole Marketing cloud-specific contract.
Speaker 4: That's when they be looking at kind of latching onto and jumping on with and co-terming too.
EndUser: Okay, yeah, if you can send me either what you sent for [PERSON-10], I don't think you copied
Speaker 4: Me on that, did you?
Speaker 4: I might have it was it had cartoon characters on it and it was slide deck.
Speaker 4: We love we love that kind of stuff here salesforce So I can send you something a little bit more formula like formal if you want to see a quote But it was kind of a slide deck which is kind of the pricing specific to this So it doesn't have any like here's what your new contract total would be or what that co-term [ORG-33] quote would look like so I can pull that together and get that to one.
EndUser: You Okay, yeah, either yeah cartoon cartoons are formal.
Speaker 4: I mean
EndUser: I don't think
Speaker 4: I have the cartoon is Gotcha. Gotcha. Now I'll send that Okay.
EndUser: Over to you right now. Perfect. Thanks.
Speaker 4: Awesome.
Speaker 4: You guys have any other questions?
Speaker 4: Let us know. But I'll be in touch [DATE-1]. I think it was telling [PERSON-7], it's [EVENT-1] here at [ORG-9]. We're You know this, [PERSON-9]. You've been through this.
Speaker 4: [DATE-30] is like, it's the end of our fiscal. I'm shocked we got a room because there's a billion people here. I've not seen or met half of them.
Speaker 4: I don't know who these people are, but they're here in my building [DATE-1]. So it's <inaudible>. So everybody's kind of trying to push and get things done [DATE-1]. So I'll send this
Speaker 5: Over to you. If you have any We're here to help.
EndUser: Questions, let us know.
Speaker 5: All right.
Agent: Great demo,
Speaker 4: [PERSON-6]. Yeah, thank Thank you all.
EndUser: You.
Speaker 4: Awesome.
Agent: Thank you.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Based on the transcript, the customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did ask several questions about the product's features, setup, and integration with their existing systems. This suggests that they are interested in understanding if the product can meet their needs. The seller also offered to set up a more formal quote and discussed co-terming the contract, which indicates a willingness to move forward with the product. Overall, while the customer's sentiment is not explicitly stated, their engagement and questions suggest a potential positive reception towards the product.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the data modeling, data connectivity, and the ability to aggregate and model data using the product. They also appreciated the potential for the product to work in tandem with their existing tools, such as [PERSON-4], to enhance their data piping and reporting capabilities. The customer was particularly interested in the multi-touch attribution app, which can help them understand the customer journey and attribute revenue to specific touchpoints. They also mentioned the potential value of having a persistent ID across all channels for more comprehensive analysis.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information on any specific concerns or objections expressed by the customer that would prevent the deal from closing. The customer did ask some questions about the product and its capabilities, but these do not necessarily indicate concerns or objections. Additionally, the customer expressed interest in the product and asked about implementation and pricing, which are typically positive indicators for a potential deal.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent?

-",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question: ""What you're saying?

   Engagement: The customer seemed more engaged as they were using a specific example from their business, indicating a deeper understanding and interest in the product's capabilities.

2. Question: ""Does that make sense? Our team or we have really great Implementation partners that we work with that are really nice packages where they can go in and set up all of your [PRODUCT-1] data to report perfectly with your [PRODUCT-4] data, media buy and add data here.""
   Engagement: The customer seemed more engaged as they expressed surprise and interest in Salesforce's implementation services, which they were not previously aware of.

3. Question: ""What's your current contract? What are the dates on it? What are you paying?""
   Engagement: The customer seemed more engaged as they asked for specific details about their current contract and pricing, indicating a higher level of interest in moving forward with the deal.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The sales rep provided a detailed demonstration of the product, explaining its features and capabilities, and answered the customer's questions.

However, the customer's concerns about data model restrictions and complex aggregations still remain somewhat unresolved.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person if they were not.

video_19767_167_6qr3y000000kAJUAA2,"Agent: Now?
Agent: Yeah. Perfect. Yes. And we'll first up. There we go.
Agent: All right. So we are [TIME-1] into the meeting. So thank you very much for joining this session. So [DATE-1] we are here to present our point of view. The proposed solution for [ORG-1].
Agent: We had a brief background. We had a discovery meeting with [ORG-2] [DATE-2] back. And this meeting is to present our point of view with regards to that discovery we conducted [DATE-2] back.
Agent: So I'll start with the next slide. So forward-looking statements, we might make a few forward-looking statement, but please make your purchasing decisions based on the currently commercially available products. Welcome. And here, so I'll start by introducing myself.
Agent: So I work as a solution engineer at [ORG-3]. My primary job is to work with my sales team and take care of the technical part in the sales cycle.
Agent: And I have been with [ORG-3] ecosystem for [DATE-3] and [DATE-4] here at [ORG-3] company.
Agent: Jan?
Agent: Yeah, so my name is [PERSON-1] and I'm based out of [GPE-1]. And I'm responsible for the [ORG-4] account and the agreement. And I normally refer to myself as a person sort of living between all the [ORG-3] clouds.
Agent: So I'm basically the main point of contact for [ORG-4] and [ORG-2] and sort of coordinating between all the different sort of internal teams at [ORG-3] that work with [ORG-4] and [ORG-2]. So that's my role, the generalist.
Agent: Hi, my name is [GPE-2].
Speaker 4: I'm an early solution engineer and I've been with the company in [DATE-5]. And [PERSON-2] is my mentor, so I'm here to shadow and to learn from this meeting [DATE-1].
EndUser: And my name is I have presented myself last time.
EndUser: I'm responsible for this meeting and you want to have you met them?
EndUser: Oh, I haven't.
Speaker 5: You and all by and I'm responsible for sales persons at [ORG-2]. So the users of this
Agent: Calendar,
Speaker 5: We are looking forward to see what you can assist us with. Very exciting. Thank you.
Agent: Very nice to meet you. I don't think we met before so. Hello. Hi. So I can just go quickly through and sort of set the stage when it comes to sales.
Agent: I think you're both quite familiar with the solution you already have in place. But to give you some background, and of course, student-run shows sales first [DATE-6].
Agent: And I think what's important when we're looking at [ORG-3] in general, but also solutions like this, is sort of the, that we often lean on is sort of the Security of the [ORG-3] platform, because it's so large, right?
Agent: So these numbers are how we're based when it comes to CRM applications globally compared to the competitors.
Agent: So this isn't just sort of the sales cycle [PRODUCT-1], these are all sort of the [PRODUCT-1] applications, meaning anything sort of a customer facing software basically, right?
Agent: So that will be marketing, service, sales, B2B, B2C, and so on.
Agent: We have quite an overwhelming market share, and that also gives us a lot of flexibility when it comes to also developing the wideness of the solution, which I think is one of the ke y corestones in YSLS versus been so successful, because there's so many different point solution s and they're all in their own rights, most of the market leaders.
Agent: So if you, for example, look a t specific solutions within marketing, we would be the market leader in that.
Agent: If you look at specifi c solutions within customer service, we're by far the largest provider in customer service software , example .
Agent: So I think that's also more just to explain where a safe space when it comes to the software applications because we're so large and wide in the applications that we have that are customer connected.
Agent: And I'll go through which parts it's connected to [ORG-2] and sort of on specifically on the next slide.
Agent: So this is what we call our customer 186, and I'll explain quickly what it is, but basically what's around it is what is already in the agreement you have with [ORG-3].
Agent: So if we start with the top, that's the sales part, right?
Agent: We have the [ORG-5] style, which is basically it's sales and service. So meaning the sales cycles and the customer service. And then on top of that, they've built banking and insurance objects.
Agent: So basically you have sales and service, and then you have [ORG-5] on top of that. That's the core solution that you have [DATE-1].
Agent: And then of course, we just also enter the agreement with [ORG-2] for the data cloud, which is sort of stepping into the Marketing side, which is, [ORG-6] has basically all of the different Marketing suites we have at [ORG-3].
Agent: I believe [ORG-2] will probably add more of those as you move forward, but that hasn't really been relevant before now. Of course, you're still having portrait in place.
Agent: So that's all basically Marketing and that also sort of connects to the sales and service, right?
Agent: Because you can use all the data from the sales and service to adapt the Marketing to Personalize journeys and so on.
Agent: And then you also have analytics, which is basically analyzing everything that happens in the [PRODUCT-1] and the customer data.
Agent: And also you can give that to the salespeople in the flow of work, meaning they could do actionable insights on and dissect their customer segments or top performing customers and so on in the [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: You have a limited amount of licenses in [ORG-7] for this, but that's also part of the agreemen t that you have right now .
Agent: And then on the bottom is your platform that's more connected to sort of the [ORG-8] and encryption project products, which are quite critical for your industry, of course. industry's solution that I already mentioned, which is financial services.
Agent: You have access to the Salesforce Trailhead, which is a non-cost learning platform, which is great for, I'm not sure if any of you are familiar with it, but it's great for you can basically learn any skill that you need in [ORG-3] and how to use [ORG-3].
Agent: And it's just logging online and using it. It tracks points and everything, so it has some gamification elements.
Agent: It's also quite easy if you want to track specific program owners, for example, and how they're doing or you have you want to have some super-users on your teams or something like that.
Agent: Great tool for them to learn sales for more specifically. It's just logging in and you can just adapt the trails, adapt the curriculum to your liking. Of course, you have had external partners like [PRODUCT-2] helping you.
Agent: We also have an internal Professional services team that also can help with implementations and expert advice and so on. So in short, we basically cover anything sort of software that is customer related.
Agent: And we have software that covers basically anything that's connected to that. And most of that is already in the [ORG-2] or [ORG-9] agreements. Some of it is only [ORG-9]. Most of it is with both, as it is now.
Agent: So that's sort of just the general status of the [ORG-9] agreement.
Agent: Do you have any pressing questions regarding?
Agent: The sales, social relationship, or the agreement, or the products that are in right now . No.
EndUser: Perfect.
Agent: All right.
Agent: Okay. So I think now what we need to understand is that the world is like more connected with more channels for Interaction and the expectation for more and more personalized experiences.
Agent: And the way we communicate with each other organizations and across world has changed More in [DATE-7] as we all know and people say that it's now the fourth industrial revolution Which has also brought the rapid technological investment advancement?
Agent: So to make sure that the custom we have a very seamless customer experience It's very important to establish the right channel of communications between the customer's partners And for example in this case you So what we need to do is to make sure that our customers are digitally connected to B2B and B2C businesses and are able to have personal interactions with the customers in the personalized way.
Agent: And there is also a challenge that there is a disconnect in the digital ecosystem that many, many times customers have ways to serve the customer, but they don't have the right platform to connect with the customer in a manner which is much more efficient for the customer and the business.
Agent: So to make sure that we have that seamless [ORG-10] between the customer and businesses, We would like to present our point of view on how can we handle your current challenges using [ORG-1].
Agent: Now, if you look at the current challenges, and these are the challenges that we have gathered from our discovery workshop, so please feel free to chime in if we have missed something.
Agent: But the first challenge is that we need to improve the customer onboarding.
Agent: There is a proper onboarding process, and we need to make sure that whenever you acquire a new customer, they are following a proper guideline to get onboarded in the [ORG-14] ecosystem.
Agent: It's a tough job to manage the availability of the advisors as of now because everything is quite manual and you need to basically invest a lot of manual effort to make sure that you are exposing the right availability on the portal.
Agent: Of course, calendar is the main part of the availability because we need to make sure that the calendars are exposed to the customer for self-service and managing calendars can be a daunting task depending on how many calendars are you managing.
Agent: Of course, sending notifications and reminders at the right time, at the right moment, the customer is a critical job.
Agent: And we want to make sure that you have the right automation to do that so that it can send reminders and notification at the right time based on the invitations. The design is also important.
Agent: You should be able to change the user interface of the calendars. And our [ORG-3] scheduler is able to cater to that requirement.
Agent: We have certain tools available in the ecosystem that can help you redesign the process and the user interface in the [ORG-3] platform. And the last is the reporting part.
Agent: Of course, you need to take actionable decisions based on how your agents and advisors are performing.
Agent: [ORG-1] has certain out-of-the-box reporting and dashboard capabilities that can help you figure out the performance of your agents or appointment overview and different aspects of reporting and dashboards. So let's talk about the proposed solution now.
Agent: So Salesforce Scheduler, it helps you optimize your appointment scheduling process. It brings customers and resources together quite easily. And the best part is that it's native on [ORG-3] platform.
Agent: And this scheduling tool helps companies easily manage the scheduling needs, delivering streamlined and personalized experiences to deepen your relationship. And this whole product is available technically on [ORG-3] core, which you already have. There is some sort of configuration.
Agent: That needs to be done to make sure that this is available for your customers and partners .
Agent: But the whole point is that it helps you build productivity, it helps you optimize your resource time, it helps you build better relationship and reduce no-show because there are certain reporting and dash coding capabilities that can help you reduce the no-show and send notification at the right time.
Agent: Now, this is an important slide for us because we want to present the value of [ORG-1]. And these are the strategic imperatives or objectives that we have gathered based on our discovery.
Agent: So you want to unlock greater [ORG-14]. You would like to also provide a rich customer experience to your end users.
Agent: And you would also like to increase the efficiency and the agility of your IT teams. And keeping these things in mind. This is, these are the solution capabilities that we are going to propose in this point of view.
Agent: First, it's native because it's sitting on the same [ORG-3] platform. So it's connected to your sales and service cloud, it's connected to your opportunity management, lead management, account management, and it builds the collaboration much more easily.
Agent: It can be both outbound and inbound, meaning that outbound as in you can, [ORG-2] can book an appointment, inbound as in the customer can book an appointment with [ORG-2] advisors. You have workflows, you have flow templates.
Agent: Which are provided by default out of the box by [ORG-3] to kick off your processes You don't need to start from scratch.
Agent: We have some intelligent matching algorithms to [ORG-13] h the right customer with the right resources based on the skills, based on the availability based on the workload .
Agent: It can be extended because it's sitting on the same [ORG-3] platform. You can extend the features and functionality of [ORG-1] to connect with other parts of your ecosystem.
Agent: And of course Integration is definitely one of the most important point because you can always connect [ORG-3] core or [ORG-1] with any other third party system depending on the requirement.
Agent: And we have APIs to do that and some of the APIs are coming as a part of the package.
Agent: [ORG-3] being an [PRODUCT-3] driven company, we are always trying to put a lot of effort when it comes to adding the artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in our product portfolio.
Agent: So that's going to be a continuous improvement throughout.
Agent: And these are the value drivers that we try to focus on, which is to reduce the time to first response, provide better customer satisfaction score, self-service capability, reduce the customer satisfaction.
Agent: Development costs, reduce the system Integration and deflect scheduling calls appropriately . Now, before we jump into the demo, just to give you a brief intro of how this setup is done.
Agent: So basically, you define locations in [ORG-3], you define the operating [TIME-2] of those locations, you define the world groups, which are like appointment topics, like mortgage, wealth, commercial, these can be your topics.
Agent: You define the work type, which is more or less like a template of what the work needs to be done as a part of this appointment. And then at the end, you assign users to the scheduling policies.
Agent: And you launch that to your audience And in this point of view we are going to use [PRODUCT-4] which is [ORG-3] own customer portal mechanis m to share data with your customers Then this demo, we are going to use [ORG-3] Cor e and Experience Cloud to present the [NORP-1] o from different persona perspective .
Agent: All right, so from a demo point of view, here are our personas. So we have like three personas here. [PERSON-3] is the customer.
Agent: And [PERSON-3] is basically someone who's going to request for a booking appointment on the customer portal, [PERSON-4] is the advisor, or she could also be an agent.
Agent: And [PERSON-5] is a customer service agent that sets on the [ORG-3] platform and receive calls. And we have a few demo scenarios which are going to run through.
Agent: So before I present the actual demo, just to give you a brief of what I'm going to present. So scenario one is the customer scheduling the appointment.
Agent: So we are giving the capability to the customer to book an appointment themselves on self-service portal. They don't need to call anyone or send emails.
Agent: They can just log into this portal and then book an appointment with the right advisor. That's scenario number one. Then re-scheduling, of course. So we have to give them the capability to re-scheduling.
Agent: Cancellation and before I talk about four, let's cover scenario one, two, three in th e demo So we are going to schedule, res schedule and cancel from a customer point of view . And please don't mind.
Agent: I need to share my switch my screen multiple times because I have like multiple windows. So please bear with me. So stop sharing and re-share my screen.
Agent: Any questions so far, [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-7], you're on based on?
Agent: No,
EndUser: So far. I'm just looks good.
Speaker 5: Good. Everything
Agent: And did we mention all sort of the challenges or what we're trying to achieve?
Speaker 5: Yeah, I think that's good.
EndUser: The key values mean.
Speaker 5: Keep our questions after the demo.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah. All right. So let's see. So. Let's assume that I'm [PERSON-3] and I need to book an appointment with someone in [GPE-3].
Agent: First of all, is my screen visible to you?
Agent: Is it [PERSON-8]?
Agent: Yes. Yeah, OK. So this is your website.
Agent: Let's assume, let's assume that there is a button somewhere on this website that says schedule an appointment and when you click on that button, it opens a new tab which is going to be discussed in our portal.
Agent: So what we have done is that we have created an experienced cloud site which is branded like your customer web page, like your [ORG-2] web page and here.
Agent: The customer gets an option to make a new appointment So here, as you can see, we have two options here So either you can view the current appointmen t or you can make an appointment right now with the advisor So I'll go ahead and complete my scenario one which is I click on this button, book an appointment which is going to ask me a few questions And this was also one of the requirement from the PowerPoin t that you would like to ask a few question s before you present .
Agent: These scheduling features. So in this case, I'm just asking these to bare minimum questions. You know, this can be enhanced.
Agent: But just for the sake of [ORG-18], I'm asking these two questions that do you have any questions related to pensions or do you want to speak with the advisors?
Agent: So if you choose no and no, instead of giving you this scheduling capability, we will just show you a message that you can contact our customer support agent on this number, this is a fictitious number, and that's all.
Agent: And this is where your flow completely ends. But let's just assume that.
Agent: Instead of choosing no and no, you actually want to have a discussion with your advisors In this case, when you proceed ahead, we present you the screen where you get this first screen and it's a guided workflow, basically.
Agent: And please note that all of these screens that you se e in this entire demo can be customized and changed. We are basically using out-of-the-box template s from [ORG-1], and we have customized that to fit your needs.
Agent: So in this case, you ca n choose by appointment topics by name of the service resource which is your advisors or you can also choose the advisor you spoke to the la st time.
Agent: In this case I'm simply going to choose by [PERSON-9] your question right I can answer here.
Speaker 5: When we work with our new customers on onboarding, could we have... How can the system know the employer of this customer?
Speaker 5: Can by name, could that be the name of the company?
Speaker 5: Because, okay, I'm employed at the start-boy, for example.
Speaker 5: Could that be the name?
Speaker 5: When we are onboarding a new company. So they choose I'm employed at this company and then they get to the right calendar for that.
Agent: Yes, so in this, in that case, we will have to have one more step before this basically create a new lead in [ORG-3].
Speaker 5: One, which will
Agent: And then that lead will be converted to an account and contact. And then you will get to this screen. So we have not built that part of the demo.
Agent: So in this case, we have assumed that you are actually a part of the company already and your company has a relationship with [ORG-2] and you as a pension holder are contacting [ORG-2] for an advisor meeting.
Speaker 5: Yeah, of course, as we work right now, we have customer teams. For example, one customer has three different advisors.
Speaker 5: So the system has to know which customer team do I relate to, and which advisors should be available for me to book an appointment with.
Agent: And that's based on the company, again, what we connected to, like I said, which, or if that [ORG-3], which I think actually uses [ORG-7], then that has to account team with you.
Speaker 5: Correct, [PERSON-10]?
Speaker 5: So,
Agent: So I think, so what we're gonna do is saying then, is you could just add that as an initial step, and then that would sink into [ORG-3].
Agent: And I think it will show later sort of how it connects, but basically that will connect to the team, and that will populate, for example, which advisors will come up.
Agent: Because it was a filter as a basically a filter before.
EndUser: It would be really nice if the first page was like [ORG-2] and start-toll and it's only for start-toll.
Agent: So
EndUser: Only the employees from start-toll goes to that page and they have the looking field of [ORG-2] and start-toll and they can see their appointments and they can book their meeting.
Agent: Together
EndUser: So it's easy to set it up like that. So we have several places where they can go either on from the web or on boarding with a customer, they have their own.
Agent: Could we do that, [PERSON-14], quite easily, right?
Agent: That's sort of the...
Agent: We are talking about building one more screen on top of this.
Agent: Yeah, but it's also sort of having a tailored portal per, for example, e-customer.
EndUser: If it's like a silo, so we have start all they have their own environment and they look in field and then we have [PERSON-14] and they have their own local field and everything and then we have the web and the web maybe ask some questions or not but.
Agent: Yeah, I understand your question. So we can always build multiple sites in [ORG-3].
Agent: How many customers are you talking about when you say [PERSON-14] and start oil?
Agent: How many customers are you talking about in Yeah, every year?
EndUser: General?
EndUser: Every year?
Agent: In total,
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You want what would you say?
Speaker 5: What we are trying to, we'll use this tool, because right now with the calendar we're using right now, I think we have about 35 customers so far [DATE-8]. and we have a certain team for each customer.
Agent: So
Speaker 5: Right now they get a special link to their calendar. So we send out a link book here. So each company has their own link which brings them to their own calendar where the right advisors are.
Speaker 5: Linked to as well.
Agent: We do have a demo for Link as well [DATE-1]. But yeah, we can always build multiple sites and then each site can be branded for each company like [PERSON-13] or [ORG-18].
Agent: But it's definitely a question of how many customers are you on boarding [DATE-9], because there are certain limitations when it comes to how many community sites can you publish on [ORG-3] and that's a contractual or commercial discussion.
Agent: But it will be a consideration implementation.
Speaker 5: Yes. And I think that we built
Agent: Probably also from your end probably in a consideration of which customer s sort of are worth having their own porta Exactly
Speaker 5: L or which I'm guessing Exactly It could be existing customers as
Agent: So you can have it of course.
Agent: Well . you Yeah,
Agent: Right. So you can have like a general portal and specialized portals for different customers.
Agent: If the customer is really very important, right?
Agent: So that is awesome.
Agent: That might be worth it. And then we can sit like this and then we can have a general one, which is sort of a casual for SMB and so on.
Speaker 5: Right. And
EndUser: Then the HR from that company maybe could have a page where they see, okay, we have booked so many people and they are still have these to have a meeting with they can also get like an analytics view a dashboard or something like that .
Speaker 5: Yes.
Agent: The HR would also, is the HR your employee or that's.
EndUser: It's a good thing. Yeah.
EndUser: So, it going?
Agent: How is
Agent: So, [PERSON-18] would be, so it's possible to build both partner and customer sites. This is a customer site.
Agent: And if you need like a customer admin, you know, like someone administrator from the customer site, that's also possible to delegate that in [ORG-3].
Agent: And that admin will have more rights and more capabilities than the normal user from that company. Would you It can be both customer community or partner.
Agent: Like a partner setup than [ORG-18]?
Agent: Yeah. All right. So checking you back to this part. So I'll choose the appointment topic. I click on next and then [ORG-3] presents me. These are the topics and which topic would you like to discuss with this advisor.
Agent: And in this case, we are going to choose [ORG-14] pension.
Agent: And you can, if you want, you can also choose like what sub topic are you interested in?
Agent: Are you interested in investing or life insurance or new product information?
Agent: So this is everything as customizable. So I have just put some hypothetical values here. Um, and then I click on next and this is where I can choose exactly.
Agent: Is it phone?
Agent: Is it branch or is it a video call?
Agent: Right?
Speaker 5: If it's a
Agent: Phone, then somebody is going to give you a phone call.
Agent: Sorry, what?
Speaker 5: That's great.
Agent: Yeah, if it's branch, then you need to visit that branch in person. And video can be an Integration to any video telephony provider.
Agent: And this video part requires some work, because every video telephony is different, like [ORG-19] or Zoom. There can be multiple options, and we can discuss about that separately.
Agent: But at least the platform gives you that capability to choose the appointment type. So in this case, let's choose at a branch, because I would like to meet my advisor in person.
Agent: I click on next And this is where I can choose, like, what's your location Are you going to visit in [GPE-4] or [GPE-1] or whatnot In this case, I'll just try to use the [GPE-4] And this is [ORG-3] is using Google Maps in the backgroun d to find the right address And then based on that, [ORG-3] presents you the optio n that we have two branches We have it in [GPE-5] And we also have this in this class for it And then you also see you're operating [TIME-2] in this UI So you can .
Agent: You know, know beforehand that what's the time, fix time for these branche s. So I'll choose let's say this one, I click on next and in this stage I can choose t he adviso r. Now we also have another demo where you don't need to choose the advisor if you don't ca re about the advisor but in this case I choose one adviso r. Let's say I'll choose [PERSON-18] and I can choose when I click on [PERSON-18], I can choose the available time slot from his calendar.
Agent: So if his calendar is not booked, it will show up here. Let's say I want to meet this guy on [DATE-10], 5th of [DATE-10] at [TIME-3].
Agent: And you can see it's like [TIME-4] of time slots. Everything is configurable.
Agent: In this example, when someone books, I book [TIME-4] for the meeting and I also book like [TIME-5] additional for the wrap up, which is not visible here. But [PERSON-18]'s calendar is booked for [TIME-6].
Agent: But here it's like booked for [TIME-4] It's only to give [PERSON-18] to give, like get more time to wrap up and close the case, right ?
Agent: And then you click on next and you review the final page here where you can basically see that you are meeting at a branch The address and everything you can put a comment here like meeting with advisor for pension plans and Then finally you click on next which basically creates an appointment at this stage and this appointment
Speaker 5: Is Yeah
Agent: Sorry, was there a question?
Agent: I think there's some sound coming somewhere.
Agent: Ok. At this stage, the appointment is booked. The advisor gets the appointment. And from a customer standpoint, the customer can also look at all the appointments.
Agent: If they can go back to this view current appointments, this button, and when you click on that, you also get the list of appointments you have booked with your advisors.
Agent: So in this case, we have created this appointment, which is 2147.
Agent: And this appointment was booked with... [PERSON-18] at this particular so later state if you want to reschedule or cancel you can visit this page and you can click on this butto n For example, if you click on reschedul e It basically gives you the option to choose another time slot and it works just fine.
Agent: So for example from it wa s on 19st o f
Agent: May I can choose any other time.
Agent: For example, I can choose this one, let's say [DATE-14], instead of, instead of [TIME-7], I can choose [TIME-8], and then I can basically just click on [ORG-19] and Submit, and this will change my invitation.
Agent: And the advisor calendar will be automatically blocked at that particular time. Similarly, you can also cancel the appointment from here if you don't want to meet any longer.
Agent: So you can just click on this confirm cancellation button, which is going to cancel the appointment and remove the event from the advisor's calendar.
Agent: And
EndUser: Is that
Speaker 5: That's calendar is that's synced with the connected to outlook for example, because we use outlook as a calendar.
Agent: Yeah, we do have a slide for that which I'll present and I'll answer that question to
Speaker 5: You. And
EndUser: All these fields which are in [LANGUAGE-1] now could be translated to [NORP-2].
Agent: Everything can be translated to [NORP-2]. And I don't know [NORP-2] much, you know, please, finally.
Agent: And also, it's done in our demo environments, they're always in... and international of course so that's all but I think that your sales force instance is in [NORP-2] if i'm not mistaken so everything can be yeah everything can be in [NORP-2] yes
Agent: Yes. Now I'm going to cover something called as anonymous scheduling, which allows you to book an appointment with your advisor, but you don't care about the advisor, so you don't need to choose the advisor, per se.
Agent: So I'll cover that. And I'm also going to cover an appointment booking through a URL. And this URL can be embedded in your email signature or a website. It, you know, it, the possibility is endless.
Agent: So I'll go back to my demo and I'll click on, I'll use the anonymous booking part first. So I click on this button, which I have placed here.
Agent: New anonymous appointment and here you can you go through the same flow but the only thin g different is that you don't choose the advisor this time the system automatically finds out th e right advisor for you based on the skills based on the availability and [ORG-18] and then that's it you don't care about the advisor and that's why we call this you can se e we did not choose the advisor we are simply choosing the time and then [ORG-3] finds the righ t advice in another sig n assigns this appointmen t. To that advisor so I can choose let's say [DATE-1] through your clock Click on next and basically at the end.
Agent: I just submit which which creates an appointment finds the right advisor and That's it. That's why it's called anonymous
Speaker 5: Booking if we go back to the first scenario when you choose pull us an advisor and How does it work if you don't want to choose an advisor?
Speaker 5: You get a list. These are three advisors are available, but you don't want to choose a certain one.
Speaker 5: Does [ORG-3] pick the one with the most?
Speaker 5: How does the pick which advisor I think I will get?
Agent: I have not configured that part, but what we can do is that it chooses the random advisor from that list. In this case, I think if I try to proceed ahead without the advisor, it probably will stop me.
Agent: Let's see. So if I don't choose the advisor and if I click on next, it's stopping me because I have not set up that.
Agent: But there is a setting in [ORG-3] that can that you can enable to choose the first one or probably the random one
Agent: From this okay.
Speaker 5: List. Yeah,
Agent: But when you, with your anonymous example, [PERSON-2], you can also do that based on skill set or availability and so on as well, right?
Agent: That's what it does. So anonymous is basically assigning this to anyone who has the right skill.
Agent: So it will only assign that to someone who knows about [ORG-2] pension because we have created something called as pension skills in [ORG-3] and we have assigned that skill to this appointment type.
Agent: So only people who have that skill will get the appointment.
Agent: Okay. So you have a junior, for example, on your team, you want something like that, someone training, they would have the business, they have the knowledge of all the [ORG-2] products with the customer.
Speaker 5: The problem of my question is, some other calendars work in alphabetical order. So, if your name is [PERSON-14], you will get all the bookings, all the anonymous bookings, because you're an A person.
Agent: No, we do have something called as appointment distribution algorithm in And this algorithm calculates something called as utilization score.
Speaker 5: Salesforce.
Agent: So we keep a track of how many appointments are getting assigned to people, you know, and then based on that, we assign the appointment evenly across everyone so that not just one person gets overloaded with all the appointment.
Agent: So we have that capability that you need to turn it on.
Agent: That doesn't have to be managed. It's just
Agent: Running in the background. Yeah, exactly. To whoever's
Speaker 5: Calendars.
Agent: So, yeah. All right. My next demo scenario is a URL. So, this is the URL as you can see on my screen.
Agent: So, we have recreated a URL and this of course there is a process to create a URL which can be done by a super user or your advisor.
Agent: So for example if your advisor wants to share his or her availability through a URL they can go to [ORG-3] and there is a setup that they need to use to generate the URL and then that URL can be embedded anywhere.
Agent: In this case I'm just copying and pasting the
Agent: Url you do that once per advisor right?
Agent: Yes, this URL is tied to an advisor. That's the thing in the platform. It's always in the context of an advisor.
Agent: So it's basically URL to the advisor. There's the scheduling function for one advisor. So it's unique to one person. So each person has their own URL, basically.
Agent: Yeah, that's the thing. Yes. But the good part is that when you create the URL, you basically pre-select a lot of things.
Agent: So in this case, as you can see, when I load my URL, I don't need to choose my [ORG-2] pension, the appointment topic. I don't need to choose my location, because the URL knows where is the pulse location.
Agent: I don't need to choose the call, because the call is pre-selected. So like the first three steps are pre-selected. So I don't need to choose them. All I need to do is just choose a time slot.
Agent: And this URL is pre-selected. URL, you can specify [EVENT-1] and the end date in the URL You can also specify the expiration date So in this case, I can only see [WORK_OF_ART-1] .
Agent: Because [PERSON-18] has mentioned in the URL that I'm only available on [DATE-14] if your book made through this URL. So you can customize if you want to keep the URL open for [DATE-13], that's also possible.
Agent: You just have to specify this, add it and end it.
Speaker 5: If we're onboarding a new customer, for example, we will have the meetings at their office, their branch.
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 5: We can say that we will be available [DATE-18] and [DATE-14] at your branch. I mean, we send them a special URL, but it gives them the opportunity to just book these states.
Agent: Yeah. And as far as branch is concerned, this is completely configurable.
Agent: You can either have the branch or you cannot have the branch, right?
Agent: You can just say that we are going to visit. And here is the appointment invitation. And here is the URL to book us, but we are going to visit you.
Speaker 5: Yeah. Okay.
Agent: So in this case, as you can see, same process. Once you land to this page, you basically choose the slot and you click on Submit, which will create an appointment in [ORG-3] for [PERSON-18].
Agent: And that's how this whole URL thing work out in [ORG-1].
Speaker 5: And I question about that, about the connection to [ORG-3].
Speaker 5: How does the calendar know who the customer is?
Speaker 5: Because what we would want to minimize the clicks for each advisor's. So right now we've forgotten appointment with the customer. The advisor has to go into [ORG-3], find the customer in [ORG-3], and attach the meeting to that customer.
Speaker 5: Could that be done already here?
Speaker 5: That if you have a log in. functional or anything. So the customer can log in and say, okay, this is my page and it's automatically connected to that specific customer.
Agent: Yeah, so I'll open my now I'm going to change my context. Now I'm going to log in a spall the advisor. So I log in a spall in [ORG-3] because the small has access to [ORG-3].
Agent: And [PERSON-18] will, so let's log in his [PERSON-18] first. And when I log in his [PERSON-18], the first thing I see is my calendar. So here let's say I can see my calendar, I can see all my appointments.
Agent: I can see the appointment which was booked by [PERSON-3] on the screen. This is the appointment and my calendar is like booked.
Agent: So if I click on this record, I can see that this Lady [PERSON-3] is the contact and she is connected to this account, Accusage.
Agent: So we does the system know that?
Speaker 5: Have... How
Agent: The system knows that because we have created the account and contact in [ORG-3].
Speaker 5: And this account...
Speaker 5: When [PERSON-3] tries to book a meeting, how does the system know that this is [PERSON-19] at Accusage Incorporated?
Agent: So as I said earlier, so let's say it's the first time you are trying to book as a guest. You don't exist in [ORG-3].
Agent: When you book as a guest, we create a That lead goes through a conversion process that creates an account and contact.
Speaker 5: Lead in [ORG-3].
Agent: And if let's say if another employee from same company comes, this time we are not going to create an account because the account already exists. So we will connect you to the same account. So account and contact exist.
Agent: And now when you look in appointment, the third step, we connect your appointment to the same account and contact, because we have that in the system already.
Agent: Now this thing, this is just one example, right?
Agent: But it depends on the business process. If you have a different business process, a different process can be configured on the guest page.
Agent: But this is part of the good part of having it on the [ORG-3] platform since the whole lead and contact and accounts, that process is already set up right to capture leads from web and so on.
Agent: So that is already based on the flexibility on that, but that's already set up in the rules for the [ORG-2] platform. So we'll basically just follow the same
Agent: Logic
Agent: As the set up is for [ORG-2]. .
Agent: Yes, and in full transparency with you, of course you need to do some work to use the account and contact data that you have, right?
Agent: Because you need to find the right contact and right account and assign the appointment. So everything is playable as long as you have the Yeah.
Agent: Data.
Agent: And you can also create data on the fly. If it's a new customer completely getting on-boarded, so you have leave, then you convert the lead to account contacts and maybe opportunity maybe not depends on the business processes.
Agent: By the way, since we don't have much time here, so we also have a demo flow for service agent. I can show it to you right now, but I guess we don't have much time.
Agent: But the process is similar. In this case, any service agent can book an appointment with a customer and any other advisor. So I am the agent, [PERSON-19] is the advisor.
Agent: So I can book an appointment on behalf of [PERSON-19].
Agent: So, [PERSON-19] will get the calendar invite in his calendar and the customer will be booked and the customer will be able to look at the appointment on the website, on the site that we have created.
Agent: So, that's also possible. We have a demo for this. If you would like, we don't have much time here, but show it to you.
Speaker 5: I can
Speaker 5: Yeah, okay. And you can set up the rules for the calendar. For example, we want the meetings to take place [DATE-18]. So we can prepare the customers.
Speaker 5: We have to send out some forms and send out the link that they should fill in some data. before the meeting. So that you can customize in the calendar as well.
Speaker 5: That's if you go in [DATE-1], the next possible time to book a meeting is [DATE-18], for example.
Agent: Yeah, the calendar automatically changes based on your availability. So if your calendar is blocked for [DATE-14], then automatically it will pop up for [DATE-19].
Speaker 5: Yeah, but if for example, we always wanted to be [DATE-19] away the meeting.
Speaker 5: Could we schedule that in the calendar with a rule that says the first available time is always [DATE-19] ahead?
Speaker 5: Or for example, if you want to onboard a new customer, I would say the onboarding process we start on [DATE-18], can we say that if this customer goes into this certain link or whatever, the first possible day to book a meeting is [DATE-18] for that customer.
Agent: Yeah, so let's say if you talk about the link here, I can.
Agent: This is the link which was created that you saw and I can choose the booking start date, right?
Agent: So let's say it's [DATE-21]. So we can repopulate this. We can write a rule that will automatically make the booking start date.
Agent: So [DATE-1] plus seven, right?
Agent: So that's the rule that we can write down. So the booking Start Date can be one
Speaker [DATE-18] in time. Yeah. Okay.
Agent: Yes. Okay. Then the next is about a very important topic which is this one. So, how to manage shift and resource absence and again this is completely possible in sales force.
Agent: I will just give you a quick glimpse here. So, if you If you look at this shift management, so we do have a shift management module as a part of Salesforce Calendar that allows you to take breaks, holidays.
Agent: For example, you go to lunch every day at [TIME-9]. So you can set up that.
Agent: As you can see, for example, [PERSON-18], you cannot book [PERSON-18] [DATE-21] every day because this guy is going for lunch during this period. Or if you look at this one, [PERSON-18], you can define your shift.
Agent: Like, if you have [TIME-10], let's say that you don't work fixed time, but you have [TIME-10]. But for example, on [DATE-10], you work from 10 to 2.
Agent: On [DATE-18], you work in the evening. On [DATE-14], you work on the daytime. You can define all of those flexible working hours using shift in [ORG-3].
Agent: So for example, let's say if I'm available, on, let's say [DATE-1], on [DATE-19], I'm only available for, let's say, [TIME-14].
Agent: So I can like, like [DATE-35], [PERSON-18], and then I can basically write down my availability that yes, I'm confirmed available, and I'm available only from, let's say, from [TIME-14] for [TIME-13], that's all.
Agent: And when I click on Save, this basically ensures that My calendar on the customer side is only visible for that [TIME-13] time slot and everything else will be grayed out.
Agent: So this is to manage your shift and availability.
Speaker 5: Yeah, or the other way around if you are, if you use Outlook as our calendar and I have marked an outlet that I'm on vacation from [DATE-19].
Speaker 5: Does the system see that as well?
Speaker 5: It's an appointment,
Agent: For example. So you do have, you didn't do need to use, okay, so I'll answer that as well. But before I answer that, this is just one slide to show you how can you build notifications in [ORG-3].
Agent: So [DATE-21] I just dragged and dropped a few components to just to give you a imagination of how this would look like if you build notification process.
Agent: In this case, I have like reminded [TIME-18] before and reminded a day before are two email alerts which can be sent to anyone, your customers or your agents or advisors, depending on the request.
Agent: You can send notifications alerts or even surveys after let's say after the meeting is [PERSON-21] e You would like to send a feedback survey even that is possible if you if you can use [ORG-3] flo w It's a drag-and-drop interface and coming to you r Before I come to your question, I do have analytics.
Agent: So we do have, let's say, this one. So this is called [ORG-21], which is [ORG-18]. And you do have, I think, the licenses in overall [PERSON-18], if I'm not wrong. And this is basically the analytics platform.
Agent: And [ORG-3] provides you an alt-a-the-box analytics templates. that you can use to run reports and you can use to find out the appointment overview, maybe agent performance, how many appointment was created [DATE-28].
Agent: You can drill down into each of these components.
Agent: The report can be much more complex and much more sophisticated than what you have here, because this is just a demo environment and this is the sample data which I have created.
Agent: But the capability of this analytics platform, it could be immense because it's a proper analytics platform. sitting on [PRODUCT-5] platform .
Agent: And like you said, there are out-of-the-box dashboards for this that basically covers likely most of what you need. If you want to be advanced with this, you want to adapt this. You can also do that.
Agent: And that's also sort of, there's no code or anything like that. That's just sort of you just build dashboards as you would expect you can do it.
Agent: So that's something sort of the super-user or something that can sort of easily be trained to do. If you want to change or adapt the dashboards based on to [ORG-2]'s processes, for example.
Agent: So that's a fairly simple task . doesn't need sort of any Implementation partner s or stuff like that .
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: And when it comes to your question, [PERSON-19], yes, it is possible to if you block your calendar in Outlook, that event will sync to [ORG-3] and then automatically the availability for that particular advisor will be blocked for customers.
Agent: And that is possible to implement through something called as Einstein activity capture. And I believe you already have the licenses. All we need to do is implement this.
Agent: And Einstein activity capture is basically it's a way to share your events bye directory. between [ORG-3] and Outlook or [ORG-21], both of them are possible .
Speaker 5: Yeah, good. But then the advice just has needs to work with one calendar and that's outlook.
Agent: Yeah, and the event will sync back to [ORG-3] and then the availability automatically blocked.
Agent: We do you can also have something like if you have a middleware or Integration platform, you can also use that because [ORG-3] also publishes an event when a event is created and then you can sync that event back to outlook.
Agent: So there are like multiple options, but the easiest option is to use [PERSON-21] activity capture because you already have it.
Agent: Yeah, and that's already also included in the in the license type you have so that's also one of them sort of more already right this access to basically just advanced functionality This
Agent: Use for <inaudible> and no cost so Yes, and to manage availability, you have holidays, you have resource absence for like breaks and leave, you can configure your scheduling policies, shift management, concurrent scheduling.
Agent: For example, if you want to book like multiple customers in the same time slot, or if you want to have like multiple advisor to the same meeting, all that sort of combination is also possible when it comes to managing availability.
Agent: And just to let you know that we are continuously improving the solution, right?
Agent: Because [ORG-3] has like three major releases [DATE-9], which means that the scope of improvement is huge. We have dedicated team, product team, which is continuously working to improve our solution.
Agent: And the latest is, I'm just putting it here to showcase that we are continuously working on [ORG-1] to improve it even better.
Agent: So we have released something called as lobby management, which is to manage your drop-in customers, right?
Agent: Many a times customers.
Agent: They just drop into your branch to your bank and then you need to meet with them and t o handle those kind of scenarios we have launched something called as lobby management for walk-in s and then you can just implement that to handle that kind of It gives you some form of console where you can see who has dropped it and you can creat e an appointment ad [ORG-19] Right on the go.
Agent: So before we wrap up, just to revisit the [ORG-3] Scheduler value framework, this is what we promised you before we started the meeting, that it's native, which is only channel, it's outbound, inbound, you have like flow templates out of the box, extensible, integratable, and intelligence.
Agent: And we are trying to keep the promise alive. And that's why I think, in my opinion, that this is a solution that can add value to your overall business processes.
Agent: Of course, there is some form of configuration to be done. There may be situations where you need to write some process automations or maybe set up integrations to outlook using [PERSON-21] activity capture .
Agent: You have all the tools that you can use to basically build this overall end-to-end solution .
Agent: And the key business value driver is to, the most important one is to deflect scheduling calls, improve customer satisfaction score, [ORG-35] scores, self service, and reduce Integration cost.
Agent: Just a couple of success stories.
Agent: This is I think very interesting because this is another bank from [ORG-19] close to 86,000 employees and they create more than 834K [DATE-35] appointment and they were able to implement this in [DATE-31].
Agent: And they are also a financial Service Cloud customer with Marketing and analytics.
Agent: Basically the same setup in essence, the same software, just a larger scale of employee. So in that sense, more complex, but otherwise the technological setup is quite similar, quite comparable.
Agent: And same again, this was for COVID-19. There was another retail bank company that quickly improvised and quick reaction to COVID-19 to allow their advisors to be booked using sales for scheduler. They were not a financial Service Cloud customer.
Agent: They were like a typical sales and service customer.
Speaker 5: I'm sorry, I have to leave for another meeting and my room is
Agent: Occupied right now, sir. Yeah, but
Agent: Jan, please go on.
Agent: I know we can let's say we I guess you on an [PERSON-14], but why don't you probably will talk after right?
Speaker 5: This,
Agent: And you can start you on me if you have unanswered questions, things that you were unclear about or things we didn't cover or anything you're unsure about.
Agent: And we can if necessary, we will respond on email or we'll have a follow-up session on [TIME-18] or something to sort of address any questions
EndUser: Like that you may or use cases may have.
EndUser: It seems like everything is possible here, but what is the cost for using this?
Agent: Yes, that's actually one thing we need to discuss when it comes to the numbers, because we tried to figure out the cost, but we need to know exactly how many people in.
EndUser: Will be logging
Agent: To the portal. So basically, well, yeah, so that's that part we have, that's fine. We also need to know how many customers will be logging into the portal.
EndUser: That's hard to know because if we put it on the web, it could be how many people can get. For example, one company is like these are awesome employees and if we have sent five companies
Agent: Let's say Say That is the maximum Ten thousand
EndUser: Meetings a year
Speaker 5: Is We have so many
Agent: Can [PERSON-2], can you unmute?
Agent: I'm just going to mute you because someone's our office.
EndUser: Very talkative in
EndUser: It's not every day we have a company like [PERSON-19] No.
Agent: With 2895 employees.
EndUser: And from the web they have, for example, maximum 108-219 bookings a year.
Agent: That's not an issue. The thing is, basically, to explain it, there's two parts structure.
EndUser: Of the licensing
Agent: So one part is scheduling part for the agents, like you said, which is 55, so that we have, that's fine. So that's one part of it.
Agent: And then the other part is the portal, so where the customers log in, right?
Agent: And they change it. So there's basically two sides of that story.
Agent: And then when it comes to the portal, there's two commercial structures for it And we just need to find which is the best one So one is called logins, and one is called members So logins make sense if there are people that are not actively using the solution a lot o f times, which they might log in less than two times a month, less than three times a month .
Agent: Which will be sort of random one person booking one point or two, and that's it, basically, right?
Agent: Then it makes sense for them for you to pay for logins because that will be more cost effective.
Agent: If you have active users that use the system a lot and log in a lot, then they should have a member function if that made sense.
EndUser: Yeah, now we use it mostly that they have this link and they book once done.
Agent: And then they are
EndUser: That was our expectation too. You don't have more than
Agent: One meeting [DATE-19]. No, exactly. So then it's then it's logins that's the most cost effective by far. The other one is more for someone logging in maybe once a week. then it makes sense to have.
Agent: Then they're a user, not as a person randomly logging in, that's a difference.
Agent: Okay, and then you said the number would be around 10,000?
EndUser: That is just from my mind. It's like, for example, we have 118, meetings per month.
EndUser: Maximum from the web [DATE-1] maybe we will have more in the future if we use it more and we don't have customers like [ORG-21] like every month so there's like 2502 here and 55 here so let's say 10,000 I think is more than we will use.
EndUser: So 10,000 [DATE-31] logins right?
EndUser: [DATE-25]
EndUser: Yeah, I know.
Agent: Can you double check [DATE-34], for example?
EndUser: That number, [PERSON-14], for
Agent: So we don't say 10, then it's 5, or it's 19, right?
Agent: So because it And then as soon as we have that, we can come back with, so basically what we'll do then is we will, oh, basically how it works when it comes to pricing and sales forces.
EndUser: Will affect the price.
Agent: The good thing is to have the what's called the [ORG-28], which is the Enterprise agreement, right, from [PERSON-35]. So what we will do then is we will add it, then we will add it.
Agent: Add any additional discounts and stuff like that we can do initially. We will give you the lis t price but basically we'll just push it quite . quite quickly, quite heavily down.
Agent: And then there might be some wiggle room after that, but I sort of at least when it comes to the studio and they can't, we normally sort of, we operate with sort of... what do you call it?
Agent: Is it not what you call it What's it?
EndUser: In [NORP-2]?
Agent: We're clear. We will be quite sort of transparent, unlike this is sort of this is around where we can land, and then it's always subject to approvals internally.
Agent: So we will come for example, say we believe we can we can be around this price, for example, but we need we need a amount of approvals.
Agent: And we never go through all the approval process before we have sort of a verbal agreement with the cost, you know, and sort of waste anyone's time.
Agent: Because there are a lot of steps that needs to do internall y is in [NORP-3] companies So there's just approval levels and that sort of thing . But you will get a ballpark, basically, which is quite realistic.
EndUser: And I said 59 advisors, but I think it's like 34 or something.
Agent: But it doesn't matter, maybe. No, not so much for the advisor. It's more if it's 10 or 5034 logins that will matter more.
Agent: So basically because the way the license is structured, if you have half a million customers, likely the solution is have 34 customers, that makes sense.
EndUser: More valuable than if you
Agent: So the more customers you have logging in, the more expensive it gets.
Agent: Again, if you have millions of customers and you're a large [NORP-3] company, they pay a lot more than the [NORP-4] company that has [MONEY-1], two thousand customers. That's the difference.
Agent: We need to figure out that and try to be as specific as possible .
EndUser: It would also be great to know the different levels. If you say 10,000, I don't know what you're doing. Because somehow more appointments, more
Agent: Means more money as well. Exactly. That's also why it's quite a big difference. And that's sort of how it's structured is it's sort of...
Agent: It's discount brackets. So for example, up to 1,000, for example, then the discount is low. And then from one two five, the discount would be x amount percent higher, and so on.
Agent: Or our internal flexibility, the list price would be the same for what one log in costs x. So that would be the same. But it will be brackets internally that we can play with and get proved.
Agent: And again, that's sort of what we tend with.
Agent: With such a large account as to the development, and so many products, we tend to be quite transparent and try more to work together to figure out this is the best solution for everyone.
EndUser: I have recently noticed that we have one problem with [ORG-35].
EndUser: Maybe you know about it, this is like, When they try to book a meeting [DATE-1] in [ORG-31], it seems like some of them get the email or notification in their junk mail.
EndUser: And I wonder if it's because the URL where it's coming from is not like [ORG-2] or if it's [ORG-35] and they get stopped in their firewall somewhere.
EndUser: And now if the possible when we get this URL from you guys that it says. if we can mostly like [ORG-2] or .
Agent: Is it so you need to also widely shows you are in outlook exchange server To make sure that it's not going to your spam inbox because sometimes
EndUser: You know they send it to spam
Agent: Yeah, but also understand the need to the customers though, [PERSON-2]. So so the customers
EndUser: Spam will be. So that's the problem because if they come from the web, we can't contact their company to say you have to whitelist our booking solution.
EndUser: But this is on board people because this is a flannel whitelist and there will be no problem.
Agent: I don't think it should be an issue. We do have, I mean during implementation, we can definitely give you the expert advice.
EndUser: I don't have the answer
Agent: Right now exactly because we need to dig deeper into what is actually causing that to spam, right?
Agent: So once we have the technical answer, then I think it's much more easier to give a recommendation.
EndUser: And you also said that you're using [PRODUCT-3] in this. How do
Agent: You use it?
Agent: No, so when I said AI, [ORG-3] is investing a lot of money when it comes to [ORG-19]. So again, safe hardware, a forward looking statement. Our assumption is that this [ORG-19] technology will also be integrated to Salesforce [GPE-6].
Agent: So maybe I don't know, you just write down something, please book a meeting with this and this person and then it But we cannot promise right now, but it's
EndUser: Will just create an appointment.
EndUser: Something under construction.
Agent: Okay, there's [PRODUCT-3] development in almost every single product line at this point. So it's... We've been doing [PRODUCT-3] since [DATE-34], but it's been speeding up quite drastically. Now it's one of the main focus areas.
EndUser: I like the presentation and you did it very well. And I also like that we can customize it as it as we want because it makes it look and feel like as well.
Agent: We want to
EndUser: And the analytics dashboard seems like more powerful than we ever needed but it's good.
Agent: It is powerful and we have not shown you even [PERCENT-1]
Agent: Definitely more of that.
EndUser: No, that is good because that between people.
Agent: Could be different
EndUser: But so what would you say So that would be back in ask them exactly how many.
Agent: Is the next step here?
Agent: So I think we need to do that and then we will go internally and see where we land when it comes to pricing.
Agent: And I will be able probably just to get that over to you by [DATE-19]. You have it quite quickly.
Agent: And then the next step is what we were thinking about is if it's needed to meet, we were talking about this last time as well.
Agent: If it makes sense to meet with the Professional services team, if you want also to look into the project, like the complexity. and so on.
Agent: This is like we have a customer with almost 108,000 employees who did this in [DATE-34] But I mean it's also a question of resources people to do it, right?
Agent: And like we were saying if you want to do it internally with the [ORG-3] team , That's great.
Agent: If you want to use the [ORG-31] team, you can, they're already working with the data cloud, right?
Agent: So you'll have some ones there.
Agent: Or if you want to use a partner, you know, for us, either we will support anyway you want, but it might be a good sort of starting point to meet with that team and sort of get a sense of the scope, right?
Agent: And they will look and sort of do some discovery sessions, quick ones on the architectural setup and so on and give you sort of a, a ball park of this is, this is about.
Agent: The size and complexity of the project again, thank you .
EndUser: .
EndUser: So this is something we could be booked within one, [DATE-29] or?
Agent: Exactly. Yeah. And then we might need one or two or three meetings, for example, to get a clear overview. And again, how we want to proceed with that is, again, we will support any direction you take.
Agent: So for us, we just wanted to make sure that solution is implemented swiftly and correctly.
EndUser: And if you do that, I'm not that. Recording is something you will submit with an email Yes.
Agent: [DATE-34]. So I can.
EndUser: Yes,
Agent: Absolutely. As soon as you can get some, if we maybe can get the volume so we can quickly just land on sort of the ballpark on the price. And then we can book the, I'll talk to Professional services.
Agent: If you think that's a good idea and we can have us start with the quick intro session, for example, [DATE-19].
Agent: And they can ask some questions to you and figure out, okay, this is exactly what we need to come back and give you a ballpark And then the final question from [NORP-5], what timeline do you have on this?
EndUser: Scope of the project.
Agent: When they will say [DATE-21].
EndUser: Do you want this up and running?
EndUser: If I ask the business, standard answer.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: Yeah. Because they really need it and they really want it. And I would say that we could start maybe after [DATE-34].
EndUser: That would be great if you could start do the Implementation And maybe be active in, let's for [DATE-45].
Agent: Say, [DATE-34].
Agent: Yeah, because what time is most critical of [DATE-34]?
Agent: Is that also [DATE-34] for you?
EndUser: Or doesn't it matter in that sense?
EndUser: No, no, but if it's done in [DATE-34], it's nice. But our most hectic period when it comes to the web is [DATE-46], yeah, so as early as possible, [DATE-52], and [DATE-34].
Agent: Okay, so please. Yeah, okay. Okay, so let's see what we do. What we figure out when we get the numbers Just perfect.
EndUser: On the portal?
Agent: And now if necessary, we can have a quick call, for example, to go through that again, a quick meeting with you and [PERSON-2], for example.
EndUser: Yeah, nice. So if we customize like one calendar somehow, is it easy to clone it and make anyone or
Agent: See every calendar is like a, so behind the scenes, you know salesforce flow. Salesforce flow is like a, it's a, it's an automation tool Okay.
EndUser: To build screens.
Agent: So every calendar is technically a salesforce flow. So it's possible Okay.
EndUser: To just clone a flow. So if I have created it once, it's easy to clone it and create another one with a different look if you feel.
Agent: Yes, but since you asked, I'm also double checking on my side, but my assumption is yes. I'll send you that on the perfect.
EndUser: Email, write it down. Okay,
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Thanks very much, guys.
Agent: Yes. Thank you, [PERSON-19].
Agent: Can I also have the email address of [PERSON-19]?
Agent: I don't have the email
EndUser: Address, so I can also put him.
Agent: Yes, and also, I'll explain that if when you talk to you on after this, if there's any sort of unanswered questions or something that we didn't cover, please let us know and we can cover that either by email or set up a separate session if there's anything specific out.
EndUser: You want to just clear I will get back to you when the others have seen this So Yeah.
Agent: Move as well. perfect. Thank you. Thank you so much.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer seemed to be positively inclined towards the seller's product.

5. ""What timeline do you have on this? When do you want this up and running?""

The sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent, such as understanding their current needs, pressing questions, and the desired timeline for implementation. They also asked about the number of users to provide a more accurate price quote.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales representative did a good job articulating the value proposition of their company and product throughout the call. They highlighted the market share and flexibility of their platform, as well as the specific benefits of their product, such as automation, customization, and reporting capabilities. They also provided examples of how their product can address the customer's challenges and improve their business processes. However, there were a few instances where the sales representative could have done a better job emphasizing the value proposition:

1. When discussing the scheduling tool, the sales representative mentioned that there is some configuration needed to make it available for the customer's customers and partners. They could have emphasized the value of this tool in optimizing the appointment scheduling process and building productivity, relationships, and reducing no-shows.
2. When discussing the strategic imperatives or objectives gathered from the discovery workshop, the sales representative could have more explicitly linked these objectives to the capabilities of their product. For example, they could have explained how the native and connected nature of their product can help unlock greater value, provide a rich customer experience, and increase the efficiency and agility of IT teams.
3.

""And you can also create data on the fly. If it's a new customer completely getting on-boarded, so you have lead, then you convert the lead to account contacts and maybe opportunity maybe not depends on the business processes."" The customer seemed more engaged as they asked follow-up questions about how the system knows the right account and contact to connect the appointment to.

2. ""And when it comes to your question, [PERSON-19], yes, it is possible to if you block your calendar in Outlook, that event will sync to [ORG-3] and then automatically the availability for that particular advisor will be blocked for customers."" The customer seemed more engaged as they asked about the possibility of setting up rules for the calendar, such as always having the first available time be a certain number of days ahead.

3. ""And then when it comes to the portal, there's two commercial structures for it And we just need to find which is the best one So one is called logins, and one is called members So logins make sense if there are people that are not actively using the solution a lot of times, which they might log in less than two times a month, less than three times a month .

video_19768_167_6qr3y000000sbaeAAA,"Agent: And before we do kind of jump into things, I did want to introduce a new face that we have on our end as well. We do have [PERSON-1] joining.
Agent: So she is one of my leaders here at [FAC-1]. And I'll pass it over to [PERSON-1], kind of introduce herself before we dive in. Hi, yes, nice to
Agent: Meet everybody. I'm [PERSON-2]. I'm the regional vice president over at [FAC-1], working closely with [PERSON-3]. And she's brought me up to speed in regards to the conversations you have previously had.
Agent: So I'm here to Support in any way that I can, and I'm looking forward to a potential successful partnership. Right. Nice to
EndUser: Meet you [PERSON-1]. I'm [PERSON-4]. I'm the CTO of [ORG-1] and [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] report to me.
EndUser: They run technology for the two products and you're getting in [ORG-2] or the two architects on our side for think time on storeforce. So just get a feel for who's in the meeting.
Agent: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Agent: Right, okay, so we can jump right in. I know we do have a lot to cover in [TIME-1] and you know, it's been a little bit of time since we've all been in one meeting group together.
Agent: So I wanted to just kind of set a little bit of a goal [DATE-1] and you know, happy to get your input.
Agent: And I wanted to make this as collaborative as possible, but you know, whatever it and I and [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-8] set out to do is you want to cover what is, you know, important to you, what we've heard so far and answer those questions, [PERSON-9], that you did send over.
Agent: And so, you know, it's really clear from our conversations.
Agent: You know, store for us, you're looking to grow you're looking to increase Revenue And the way you're looking to do tha t is through onboarding faster You know, really providing that key dat a and being that all in one place for your retailers And you know, I think that's what brings us her e is shifting from the current approac h from more traditional point to point approac h to something more like an API or innovative approach which is, again, what we're happy to kind of cha t through [ORG-3] [ORG-4] And you know, really how we're able to accelerat e that delivery Support your needs again [DATE-1], but in the futur e. And you know.
Agent: ..
Agent: I know we kind of covered a lot of this with [PERSON-10], but I do want to take [TIME-2] at the start to take a step back from the technology side and really kind of touch about the meals off story a bit more.
Agent: This is really what makes us unique. And I want to kind of set out why we're even here, the problem we're addressing.
Agent: And that unique approach to connectivity and where our customers see significant value, is that okay if I do that for [TIME-3]?
Agent: Great. Yeah, definitely. Perfect.
Agent: So again, why, why [PERSON-13]?
Agent: Why are we even here?
Agent: And it really begins from a giant step back, which is, you know, the world is changing at a rapid rate. And you know, it's constantly innovating and it's really made way for this conversion of digital forces.
Agent: And you know, businesses like yourself and like [PERSON-13], we have to deal with significant change.
Agent: You know, it's [PRODUCT-1], it's automation of analytics and whatever it may be, it's changing the ways that companies have to structure themselves and operate and compete just to stay relevant And so this puts [QUANTITY-1] of [ORG-5] e and from what we've heard with you guys as well it's put a lot of pressure to be able to shift and to chang e and to be able to address these trends And we understand that, especially when there are I T capacity strains from a resource timing and budge t standpoint And that's really what increases the gap here as you can see on the diagram And it continues to grow And that's really where [NORP-1] was born And what we're set out to do is just solve this gap And I think it's kind of important to addre ss why this even exists, and again, why we're her e. And it's really because when you look at traditionalapproachestointegratio n, you'll find these point to point approach es being very slow and [PERSON-12]: And it's because it kind of creates like a spaghetti cod e. It creates a lot of challenges, a lack of visibilit y, Security risks, and again, unstructured dat a.
Agent: And I know this is not new news to you al l, so I won't touch too into i t. But those challenges, I do want to [PERSON-17], if not just wit h. costs, it's with speed.
Agent: And that is a critical importance to store force. So all in all, y our growth is going to be constrained with how quickly you can build your integrations.
Agent: And you know, [PERSON-17], we've talked about this a little bit, but if you want to have that exponent ial growth for your business, you're going to need to have, you know, exponential gro wth and number of a part integrations.
Agent: And you know, with traditions with approaches l ike this, it's going to actually end up with, you know, the amount of maintenance that you just spend on, and none of the work is going to also increase as well.
Agent: And so that k ind of le ads to the question of how we do things differen tly. And then the answer is really around the [NORP-1] and how we look at API's.
Agent: And that is really what we think is fundamental and digital transformation.
Agent: And you can kind of see here, if I've mapped it out, a little fun lego blocks, but it really is a great way to visualize it and think about it. Because we really design these APIs differently.
Agent: And it's really around not only getting access to this data, but also being able to use them as an asset and again as a building block. So every API.
Agent: As you can see on that list, it's fast, it's agile by design, you know, with [ORG-6] built in And because they are, you know, these [ORG-7] blocks, you're able to reuse them, which dramaticall y lowers your cost.
Agent: And more importantly, I think for you guys , accelerates your speed to delivery. And our APIs, again, are built and developed not from scratch, but with different templates and accelerators.
Agent: And so you're really able to work off a launch pad. And you're not going to be building these integrations from ground zero.
Agent: And what this means for you is that you're able to work with a lot of different systems to make sure that data is going to be going from one place to another in a very secure and safe manner.
Agent: And if I just want to dive a little bit into the use Cases we've discussed so far, I know we've seen this outline with [PERSON-12]Agent: In our last call, but using that Shopify and [ORG-8] as examples, you can see here how [PRODUCT-2] really approache s Integration differently, and how APIs are use d as those building blocks .
Agent: If I was to kind of highlight that system [PERSON-17] r at the bottom, this is how we democratize acces s to your core systems of record, and then [ORG-9] e able to transform that data to the middle process layer .
Agent: The reason that we want to decouple and [ORG-10] that data as well as that data access to data is because you're going to see from future initiative to future initiativ e, you're going to be able to deliver those faster.
Agent: And you know, the reason is because not everythi ng is going to be so tightly coupled, like we did see in that spaghetti slide a [ORG-13] e, this spaghetti Code in a couple of slides befor e. I promise I'm almost done and I'm going to pass it over [PERSON-10], but I really want to leave off with, I think probably the best visualization that we do have about, you know, digital transformation and reuse on the meal soft end.
Agent: You know, [PERSON-21], I think we kind of joked a little bit about like reuse being the buzzword and I think in connectivity space right now and everyone has their own definition.
Agent: And this really does depict it in the way that meal soft views it. I like to kind of think about it in like a compounding in dressed way.
Agent: You know, we're kind of taught when you want financial independence fro m like a young age, you gotta start saving and you gotta start early on .
Agent: Because of that compound interest, it's very similar with the idea of Integration and technology projects.
Agent: If you think about reusability and you're actually able to reuse these assets, so you can see in the diagram of project 1, project 2, and project 3, then you have this flywheel effect.
Agent: Being able to deliver these projects faster, being able to then deliver on your business initiatives, like your growth, your revenue, even faster than again with this API. use.
Agent: So I really wanted to drown home [DATE-1] that you know at the end of this . [NORP-1], this is what we allow you to do. This is really where the customers see the value in our platform.
Agent: And this is what [PERSON-10] is going to now kind of bring to life and drown home in our demo as well as going through these questions.
Agent: So I'm going to pass it over to [PERSON-10] to kind of take over from here. Thanks, [PERSON-17].
Agent: I'm just going to share my screen.
EndUser: Well,
Agent: [PERSON-17] pulling that up and be curious is anybody have any thoughts or questions and regards to what many had just walked through or if anything in particular resonates with you.
EndUser: I think the value proposition is pretty clear. You know, we've been talking to others as well and Yeah, like. Getting these out of one-off programs and, you know, re-use is big. Just having a management around these integrations.
EndUser: So when they fail, you have a place to go and you can see what's happening.
EndUser: And being able to connect to a variety of things, not having to build everything scratch, but if you have to build something like a new connector or something, I think, you know, you can. So the biggest question.
EndUser: That I think I'm going to have is how to compare you all with a workado because you all are the two finals. And, you know, I think there are a little different approaches on each side.
EndUser: So maybe it's really sometime maybe at the end to talk on that and maybe [PERSON-10], as you go, if you have differentiators you know of maybe call them out just so we have a good sense.
EndUser: I think [PERSON-23] has more of a UI, a better UI for building integrations. I know that you have to go to connectors and build them and there's maybe some complexity there.
EndUser: We're not really afraid of technology, right?
EndUser: We're all technical people. So it's not necessarily that we have to have a business analyst managing integrations, but, you know, that's one of the differentiators with them.
EndUser: They do have a pretty slick UI and the team was pretty excited about that. And I think also [PERSON-23] getting into pricing after this, you know, offline, it's going to be, I think you all charge.
EndUser: Maybe by the cores or something that's a little bit different than they're more of a consumption-based model. That could be a difference as well.
EndUser: So does that make sense, [PERSON-1]?
Agent: No, absolutely. Thank you for sharing and [PERSON-10] will speak to some of these things as you walks through the demo.
Agent: And if there's anything that you see that we might not be speaking to that you really liked about what you saw it with work at all, please call that out.
Agent: Let us know because we may be able to have those capabilities and features and whatnot. And if there is anything that you didn't like of what you saw at work how to let us know so we can.
Agent: And it's how we do things on our behalf.
EndUser: That's great.
Agent: Perfect. So I guess to begin my slide, I think this is one of the key differentiators of me all soft actually is.
Agent: I know we've talked a lot about API led API this API that but really the main, the main benefit of the any point platform is that it's really not just design for API it's not just design for integrations it's not just design for [ORG-12] programs where oftentimes I see customers where they start with a tool that's catered towards real-time Integration something like that.
Agent: Like a work auto, but then they realized, oh, actually , tool doesn't actually meet our needs for APIs . doesn't meet our needs for larger scale data migration s or larger scale .
Agent: Places where we're dealing with thousands, millions of records.
Agent: And so really one of the key differentiators with me all soft is that we can Support any Integration pattern, whether that be APIs and the more batch style integrations we'll be talking about [DATE-1], but also potentially around real-time integrations, IoT, where if you want to capture real-time streaming data from your stores, for example, directly from the [PERSON-29] systems, these are all.
Agent: Use Cases that we Support And if there's a large [ORG-17] that has a lot of dat a needs that you can think of, there's a very large chanc e that MiOSUP is actually powering them behind the scene s where there's not really any company that's going to b e moving off MiOSUP because they're hitting the limi t where we're essentially the upper limit per s e of integrations And so , That's really good.
EndUser: Thank you. Let's see. Helpful.
EndUser: And one thing I just want to point out that actually was it clear in work, [PERSON-17], and it just hit me as you were saying that is the the aggregation of data and the summarization of data.
EndUser: And so one of the youth states is you have [GPE-1] and the store for scene habits getting like a transaction fee.
EndUser: From a point of sale system where you're going through and there's returns, there's revenue, you know, transactions and such. And there's something that data up.
EndUser: And a lot of times they're getting in flat files and they force the client to sum it up.
EndUser: But if we hit the API, a lot of that data is streaming through and [DATE-2], [TIME-4], give me honesty of any, we're running a full extractive data for [DATE-3].
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: So it's not net new, it's just a full extractive of data.
EndUser: I think in workado, you know, we asked about how would you summarize data like this and you know they talked about you could create loops, you could put it in temp tables, they certainly have ways to do it, but I see that you've got aggregation on here specifically and we may be dealing with large amounts of data, so maybe that's more in your wheel eyes.
Agent: Yeah, so I was going to save this for the actual technical presentation because I built a very quick demo showcasing what that aggregation might look like but one of the keys every I've used quite a few different Integration platforms.
Agent: In [DATE-4], every single platform that has a slick UI where they say you'll never see a line of [LAW-1] that's because they're hiding it in order to make it simpler for you to build out those very straightforward point to point integrations but.
Agent: The second you want to do something that the tooling doesn't explicitly have drag and drop features to do, then you're building loops, then you're building these crazy work-around processes that take up [DATE-5] of work trying to finagle the tool to make you do what you want to do.
Agent: Whereas with [ORG-17], because it exposes a bit more of that complexity in the way that it enables you to build things out easier, you'll see I'm assuming.
Agent: Essentially just doing this in a single script essentially And that scripting is still very straightforwar d where if you've ever worked with data structure s before if you've ever done any form of scripting even [PRODUCT-3] formulas, it's all very straightforward and simpl e because it's designed specifically for workin g with large volumes of data and being able to essentiall y maneuver data in a way that you want to go essentially .
EndUser: [PERSON-10], do you guys have a capital connection?
Agent: Yes, so I'll be diving in. So I have a list of questions from you. I'll be diving into them all both in terms of this presentation and in terms of the actual technical data.
EndUser: Ok, I'll shut up.
Agent: Great. But feel free to ask any questions if they do come up or if I've missed anything. But I'll breeze through the slides quickly, but essentially.
Agent: So we've covered that we Support every Integration pattern, but I also want to very quickly go over how the platform is structured. Yes, enthusiasm always makes these calls a lot more fun.
Agent: So essentially, we'll be covering specifically the Integration portion of the platform or we'll be taking a dive into what that actually looks like.
Agent: But essentially the platform consists of all of these different components that are all designed to work together. So that, again, regardless of our integration. pattern you're building.
Agent: You have the same security, you have the [PERSON-29] e monitoring, you have the same management, you have the same catalog across al l those different assets because again I've seen a lot of Cases where customer s have different tools for real-time integrations, APIs and [ORG-12] and for yo u to be able to have that single picture of even just which of my processes ar e succeeding, how long are my processes taking, if there is a failure is anythin g cascading to the next level, you have three different places where you'r e checking logs and so that' s That's really another key differentiator in [PERSON-23] You're able to have all of that logging all of that monitoring in a single place so that it's a lot easier to manage your integrations because If you're building an Integration for every store you're onboarding and you're looking to onboard quite a few stores by [DATE-6], that's a lot of different places that you're going to be checking the logs for.
Agent: And any point makes it very easy to, for example, set up proactive alerts that you're able to essentially know that something's taking longer than it should before it becomes a fail point essentially.
Agent: And then the other part, I think there are a few questions around tenancy and in terms of hosting.
Agent: So I'll very quickly cover that as well, where for where your applications actually are running, you have a few different options where you can run them on your own server, you can run them on your own private cloud.
Agent: But generally speaking, we see our customers go with our fully managed platform as a service, which is called CloudHip2.0. And that's essentially where you build your application, you can't deploy. It goes onto our shares.
Agent: Fully match infrastructure so you don't have to worry about operating system updates.
Agent: You don' t have to worry about Security patches that's all handled by us where you just manag e how much you want the application to scale if you needed to scale, or any other parameters like that, but everything else we're fully managing.
Agent: And specifically for Cloud, I'm sorry, this is going to be a bit of a text dump. I was hoping that it would cover some of the concerns you have.
Agent: I think one of the other key differentiators around the [ORG-12] platform is that you can essentially get very granular as to how you want your applications deployed, We allow you to not just decide what continent you're deploying your applications to, but we also have a lot of different regions for each continent.
Agent: So, for example, you can specifically say, I want my application to deploy in the [NORP-2] server so that our data is never leaving [GPE-2], for example. And I think the other question was around [NORP-3] privacy.
Agent: So we also do have a deployment target in [GPE-3]. So if there are... Customers that have said, hey, we can't have any of our data ever leave [GPE-4], then you can also deploy your [PRODUCT-4] applications there as well.
Agent: So you have very granular control as to where your data is residing essentially.
Agent: And I think there is also a question around multi-tenancy where with [FAC-2], you also have a lot of options to essentially have your own private and dedicated [ORG-17] or private network within our fully managed infrastructure so that you can ensure that your data is staying within a private network that's dedicated towards you and your applications only.
Agent: And every single application that you're deploying, that's essentially being set up in a standalone container so that if anything happens to the application, if it crashes, if it has to restart, it's only going to impact that application itself and none of your other applications will be impacted.
Agent: And then, as well. We don't inspect store or interact directly with the payload data and we have a whole list of certifications where we have banks using [ORG-21] out in [FAC-3].
Agent: Have we have governments using it?
Agent: We have healthcare agencies using it?
Agent: It's all up to the industry standards that you would expect an Enterprise information platform to have.
Agent: And did you have a question?
EndUser: Yeah, it sounds like you don't have the concept of account or sub account in a true multi-tenant way where you log in and you know all of our customers will be sub accounts under the store for some brella.
EndUser: Like I get that I'm sure you're secure because you're in banks and everything else so there's no doubt I like the idea of [LOC-1] versus [GPE-4].
EndUser: For [ORG-17], the way they handle [LOC-1] versus [GPE-4] is, you're going to log into an entirely different place and operate there.
EndUser: It sounds like maybe you all still have the same interface, but you can point it to different places when you're deploying.
EndUser: Is that right?
EndUser: So that's maybe a differentiator if I heard it right. But the tendency, it sounds like you don't really have the concept of a true, true, like OEM type of solution.
EndUser: Is that right or am I misreading?
Agent: Do you mean in terms of essentially allowing you to provide the ability for one of your customers to log into any point on their behalf in their own account, under your parent meals off account essentially?
EndUser: Yeah, I don't know if we'd let our customers in there, but if if anyone was logging in, you could specify the account is the way I think it works. And I can say, okay, here's the retailer.
EndUser: And I'm in the [ORG-17] account.
EndUser: And now everything in there is tied to [ORG-17], right?
Agent: Yeah, I mean, I think I misinterpreted what you meant by multi-tenancy, but we definitely Support that where here you can see I'm in my any point org.
Agent: This is the exchange for my organization, so this is going to show me all the assets across my entire organization. But if I go into here, you can see there's a little building here.
Agent: That's how you can essentially segment based on what are called business groups.
Agent: So if you do want to segment the assets based on your end customers, you're definitely able to do that where you can view things from both the root level.
Agent: So all of your organizations, if you want someone to have, for example, the full view of all of your assets across all of your customers, but you can also segment things based on specific subgroups, if you want to group that by customer, so that you can see all of [PERSON-34] barrels assets in a single view rather than seeing it mixed within other groups.
Agent: � Does that answer what you're looking for?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, without knowing the details, I think I'm sure there's differences there, but I don't know, I don't know [PERSON-5] or anybody else has further questions on that. I don't think I do right now.
EndUser: It's not, I'd rather see kind of the demo of connecting things and what the [ORG-23] looks like and everything else. Speak up if anybody on the team does. Looks like we're good.
Agent: Okay. Okay. So.
Agent: The next diagram was essentially just showing a visual image of how you can, the different ways that you can network to make sure your data doesn't go outside your organization essentially I can go back to this if there are any questions but I'll skip through to get to the good stuff so.
Agent: For the demo itself, I'll be showcasing essentially. an example Integration where I didn't have access to any demo POS system.
Agent: So we're just going to use [ORG-23] as a stand-in for that, but you can essentially imagine that being pretty much any system that we can connect to because we have quite a few connectors.
Agent: We have Shopify, we have [PERSON-29], et cetera. And so in this case, I'm just using [ORG-23] and then we're essentially taking all of the opportunities for my [ORG-23] org.
Agent: And then we're aggregating it based on the store number and the order date. And then we're going to push that.
Agent: Into a SQL database where for that SQL database, I have a system API in front of it to make i t simpler to connect into .
Agent: And we'll also see how we can consume that SQL database through [ORG-29] to make it simpler for me as somebody is building this batch aggregation process.
Agent: We'll also see how we can see sample data, and we'll also take a dive into what that scripting actually looks like to make that aggregation happen.
Agent: So firstly, I do want to quickly showcase just a visual as to what that will look like. So here we have that store, the underlying storeforce database, which is housing that store information for the summarized orders.
Agent: And then we already have a storeforce database API built in front of it.
Agent: So that's essentially going to make it easier for me to connect into that database so that I can essentially build this aggregation step that's integrating between [ORG-23] and that database without knowing any SQL, without having to spend a lot of time with the database administrator to understand how to connect into that database without destroying it or causing any issues with writing an optimized query, for example.
Agent: And specifically, we'll be taking an example as to how we're building this process integration, again, between that POS system, in this case, [ORG-23] to that store-force database API.
Agent: Are there any questions so far?
EndUser: Not for me.
Agent: Okay, perfect. So the first step we're going to do is we're going into the any point platform and wearing exchange, which again is essentially the centralized catalog for all of the different assets I've created within my organization.
Agent: So this is really that key place where we're going to enable reuse through cataloging everything we build in the any point platform and allowing people who have permission to view it to be able to reuse it essentially.
Agent: And so in this case, I'm connecting into my on-prem SQL database system API, but if I go over to the provided by meal soft side, this is going to show me all the assets that are provided by meal stuff, including connectors, templates, and examples that are going to help accelerate the delivery of my projects essentially.
Agent: And we'll dive into some of the connectors that we have in [TIME-5]. But in this case, we want to build something that leverages the on-prem [ORG-17] SQL database. So I see it over here.
Agent: I'm going to click into it. And then here, I'm going to see that I have some documentation that basically tells me where it falls in the context of my grander API networks.
Agent: So I can add in images, I can add in text, I can add in videos that basically provide more context and documentation as to how to use this API.
Agent: And on the left-hand side here, I can see this is going to showcase all of the different ways I can interact with the API.
Agent: So I can see I can do things with customers, and I can also do things with store sales. In this case, we want to essentially add new store sales to this database.
Agent: So I'm going to go into the post section here. And then this is essentially going to show me exactly how I can create those new store sales.
Agent: So here we can see What's expected from this API is that I'm going to provide it with a body. So in that body, it's going to ask for essentially a list of an object containing three things.
Agent: The first one being a store ID, which is a string. The next one being a date, which we're representing as a string here. And then the next one is sales, which is just going to be an integer.
Agent: And so. We can see here, once we provide that request, we're going to get a response that basically says whether or not that was successfully inserted.
Agent: And then we can see on the right-hand side here, we also have a way to directly interact with a mocking service, which essentially allows me to simulate what it's like to interact with this API so that I, as somebody who's building a process that's dependent on it, can fully understand what that [ORG-29] will look like.
Agent: And if I scroll down here, I can also see that it's going to expect some credentials, so client ID and client secret, because obviously, we don't want just anyone being able to connect into this, we want to make sure it's fully secure.
Agent: And so once I have looked through this documentation, it looks like exactly what I'm looking for. I'm going to hit the request access button. I'll select the API instance, also like my API.
Agent: And then my click request access, that's going to trigger an approval flow where the owner of this API is then going to look at the user that's requested access.
Agent: And then they're either going to approve or deny based on whether they think I should have access.
Agent: And in this case, I already have access, but once that approval is granted, that's when you'll get the client ID and client secret that's going to allow me to connect into this API.
Agent: And so far, are there any questions?
EndUser: I have a question. So our API's, we have, you know, let's say a couple hundred customers. Every customer has, I guess, the same API, different domain.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Is there a way to not have to rebuild?
EndUser: Like, that would be a... You call this a connector that we're looking at or what is this called?
Agent: So this would be called an API, but if it's built in [GPE-5], it essentially functions as a connector as well, which I'll show you.
Agent: But if you're talking about the customer systems where you have a hundred different points that might be That might be the same.
Agent: That isn't necessarily something you build an API around, but that's something that you could definitely build a template where if you're always going to be getting data in a similar way from that API and then transforming it in a similar way plus or minus a few fields and then putting it into the same database, you can create what's called a template, which is essentially a productized version of a sample flow where you can essentially.
Agent: Have [PERCENT-1] of the flow already built because again if for those 101 customers, you're doing the same thing You create a template that's representative of the general process You pull that template down and then you basically just fill i n the customers credentials or endpoint add in whatever custom fields you need to add in and then you essentially have that use case done rather than again having to constantly rebuild and redo everything .
EndUser: What is the difference between a connector and an API?
Agent: So a connector is essentially an easier way to get into an underlying system.
Agent: So for example, with [ORG-23], you can connect directly to the [ORG-23] API or you can leverage our connector, which essentially gives you a simpler way to interact with that API.
Agent: But in [ORG-23], when you're actually... when you're actually building an API in front of one of your underlying system, you're essentially building a translation layer of sorts, which is essentially going to allow someone to, it's almost like building a connector and a gateway at the same time, where that connector is going to simplify the connectivity into that backend system.
Agent: By, for example, turning these requests where I'm saying, I want to create a new store. These are the details.
Agent: And I don't want to know how to do in SQL This API is essentially converting tha t that rest call into SQL for you.
Agent: Does that help answer your question?
Agent: I
EndUser: Think so. Thanks, [PERSON-29]. Very good. We can revisit it.
EndUser: I mean, is the connector dealing with like keys and like access and authentication and those sorts of things?
EndUser: And the API is the definition of the API.
Agent: Yeah, so generally an API would be for your underlying systems and then a connector would be for connecting into your customer systems. If that makes sense.
EndUser: Okay, that helps. Thank you.
Agent: Yeah, no problem. Okay, so now we found this API that we want to leverage. And so The next step is I actually have to build that process that's bringing data from the POS into this [ORG-17] SQL database.
Agent: And so to do that, I'm going to leverage any point studio. And so this is essentially the place where we're building all of our integrations and APIs and actually making, but essentially making the API or the [ORG-34] tick.
Agent: And so in this case, right here, this is the Integration flow I've built. That's again, bringing data from.
Agent: [ORG-23], which is representing our POS system, doing an aggregation of that data into essentially orders by store, sale, and by date. And then we're going to put that into our SQL database.
Agent: So I'll very quickly go through each step here. So the first step is a scheduler. It's pretty straightforward. This is essentially how we're going to trigger this flow.
Agent: And so here we can specify, for example, how often we want this scheduler to run. whether that be in [DATE-7] in terms of minutes, etc.
Agent: But it's also something that we can customize in a centralized place after we've actually deployed this application. And so the next step, this is our [ORG-23] connector.
Agent: We can essentially imagine this to be the connection to the POS system where, again, this is going to make it easier for me to connect into my back-end POS system so that I don't necessarily have to work with just a straight REST API.
Agent: But... you For my [ORG-23] connector, we add in our configuration here. This is where we're also going to be starting the credentials for our [ORG-23] connection.
Agent: And then here, we're using what's called [PERSON-34], which is this [ORG-23] query language to essentially get my amount closed, and store a number from the opportunity table, where essentially all of our, only for our closed one opportunity.
Agent: So this is again, going to simulate what it's like to pull. to pull orders from a system.
Agent: And you can see here, I have a few other connectors pulled down from [ORG-29], where we also have a Shopify connector as well, where these are just some of the ways we can interact with Shopify.
Agent: So we can, for example, run a process every time a new order is created, for example, or we can also get a list of orders if we want as well.
Agent: And so that's similarly how we would fetch these orders from [ORG-29].
Agent: And then the next step, this is essentially the scripting that's going to transform those individual opportunities or orders into essentially those summarized groups of store numbers and closed dates or order dates.
Agent: And so essentially with our data weave scripting language, it is a scripting language. So you should have some familiarity with how those work before using it.
Agent: But we do have a lot of really good resources, including this one over here called [PERSON-34], which is essentially how I learned DataWeave.
Agent: Essentially, as soon as you know nothing about scripting language and it gives you a full interactive tutorial that walks you through every single part of the web. the language .
Agent: From the very basics like what is a data type, what is a number in data weave to, how to do if L statements and how to do pre functions or how to work with arrays in this case.
Agent: And so this also gives us an interactive way to see what it's like to essentially run data weave through an example payload. So here, this is the same script that I have in my any point flow.
Agent: And here in real time, I can essentially, see what it's like where here we have a list of individual orders with the store ID amount and date.
Agent: And essentially, what we're doing is we're using a series of functions to essentially firstly group the records based on the store ID and the order date.
Agent: And then we're essentially going to use a map to essentially take that original list of individual orders.
Agent: And then based on that grouping of store ID and date, give us back the store ID, the sum of the order amounts, and then the date based on that grouping.
Agent: And then on the right hand side here, we can essentially see what that output. looks like . And I understand that this scripting is a bit more complex than what some other platforms offer.
Agent: But again, for a lot of those platforms, you're not actually able to do any scripting, which might sound like a pro at first.
Agent: But when you're hearing things like, oh, in order to do the aggregation, you have to do a series of loops. And you have to do all of these crazy things. It's variables and temporary values. Then you're essentially a.
Agent: You're essentially creating a, I think they're called [ORG-29] machines, but a [ORG-29] machine to do what theoretically one script should allow you to do.
Agent: And so, Essentially, DataWeave gives you the best of both worlds where if you just want to, for example, do a simple mapping where I just want the amount to go directly here, you can theoretically just drag the amount here to the sales value here and then [ORG-34] is essentially going to automatically create that mapping for you.
Agent: And it'll automatically generate script. But here I've done a bit of that custom scripting. I've added some documentation here.
Agent: So that's theoretically, if I do turn this into an example or a template for others to use, they'll be able to understand what the script does instead of having to reverse engineer, which I have done for a lot of other Integration platforms.
Agent: So just looking at this big mess that was trying to do something that theoretically a scripture have been able to do and having to reverse engineer that based on. context clues essentially.
Agent: And so once we've done that transformation through data, we're then going to use that system API to put that store sale into the database. And so here, for example, we're seeing all this operation requires.
Agent: So I'm just going to pull this up here. So this is that same API that I saw in [ORG-29] earlier. You can see these are the methods that it allows me to do.
Agent: And then when I drag the Create Store Sale option in here, it's essentially just saying this is the only thing you have to fill in in order to work with this API.
Agent: And so that's just going to be the payload. And if I, again, have any questions about what that is. payload is, I can just go back into exchange and see the documentation.
Agent: Okay, this is the payloa d it's expecting, so I have to make sure that . what I'm providing it is going to be a store ID a date and sales.
Agent: And as well, when I'm looking at this scripting or the data we've module, I can also see that metadata of what the body is expecting. That's automatically populated.
Agent: So here I can see right here, it wants a date, store ID and sales in a list essentially. And so I've just gone through quite a bit to showcase how I've built out that use case.
Agent: I'll take a quick pause and see if there are any questions.
EndUser: What sort of restrictions do you place on these scripting functions?
EndUser: Like for example, I know in the salesforce career language, they have a good reason to have to be very careful with the phrasing restrictions on how you write your script and how it runs in a cloud.
EndUser: So this is still running in your cloud environment. What sort of protections and limits, time-based or anything else to you, that's what I'm just...
Agent: Yeah, so think for salesforce, it's a bit different because on salesforce, it's multi-tenant.
EndUser: I
Agent: So when you're writing [PRODUCT-5] code, they essentially have to make sure that if you do something in your org, it's not going to impact everyone else's org running in that same pod.
Agent: But with the [ORG-12] platform, because every application is running in its own container that's isolated from even your other meal applications, you don't have to worry as much about. that.
Agent: But there aren't really any limitations per say in data we've where theoretically. if you are working with a lot of data and you write on optimized script, it might run a bit slower, but we aren't.
Agent: So, and going into your comment earlier [PERSON-4], so the licensing has also changed a bit where we're also a bit more consumption based where we don't really license based on CPU utilization anymore so theoretically there wouldn't be too much impact as.
Agent: If you write on optimized script, you just might not get things as quickly as you want, which doesn't matter as much for a batch process.
Agent: But if you're running real-time processes, that's where you might find running, finding a way to optimize your script would have more benefits.
Agent: Does that help answer your cross-function?
EndUser: It does. Yes. Again, comparing work harder, I think they had something like a [TIME-6] time limit for a specific function to run in. So just sort of comparing things like that.
Agent: Gotcha, yeah.
EndUser: So you don't place a sort of, you need an average sort of hard limit on need to set a data or anything like that.
Agent: Aggregate units, you We do not know. I have a conversation regarding command to the data.
EndUser: So if we need to aggregate 10 million software, I must say, what is your, how can we implement it in your solution?
EndUser: So we have a, we have a right. We're gonna need to read data from, by API, let's go. 10 of records.
Agent: Yeah, I think there's a few different ways to do that where I'm just doing a very straightforward Example here, but if you're looking to do something with millions of records Um, what we would often see is customers using a shoe There's something called the batch scope, which there we go the batch scope and that essentially Allows you to do whatever you're looking to do in chunks whether that be processing the messages Whether that be getting the messages and that's essentially going to allow you to .
Agent: Because you're doing things in chunks, you're able to essentially have fail safe so that if one record fails of the 10 million, you don't end up having to essentially redo the whole thing.
Agent: You're able to do things in a lot more of a safe manner if you're dealing with that many records essentially.
Agent: Does that help answer your question?
EndUser: Yes, yes. And if process is failed in the middle, the next time when [GPE-6] is processed, it will start from the beginning, or he will continue processing.
Agent: So if you don't implement any fail safes, it would start from the beginning, but there are ways through the error handling, which I didn't really get into [DATE-1], but it's a very big can of worms because our error handling is very comprehensive where theoretically,
Agent: If you're running 10 million records, what you might do is you might use something called an object store that essentially allows you to store a persistent value. That's basically the last successful record that we ran through.
Agent: And then if your process fails midway through writing maybe 5 million records to that database, you can essentially have the last record you were able to successfully write and then pick up on that database.
Agent: On that API call saying, hey, I want everything from that last record to the current recor d that I'm looking to get essentially.
Agent: Does that help answer your question ?
EndUser: It is very conscious.
Speaker 7: I have a question. How fast or slow such kind of processing would be.
Speaker 7: So we have, let's say we have in the same example, millions of records in this exact schema, just three fields, and we need to aggregate it not by day, but by [TIME-7], let's say.
Speaker 7: How long is it going to take?
Agent: I think it really depends because honestly, oftentimes when it comes to those kinds of processes, the biggest bottleneck is the API itself, because the API themselves, if they aren't designed to get 10 million records, you might be iterating through that API for a very long time before you actually get that collection of 10 million records.
Agent: But as for the actual processing, of the records. It's changed a bit with Meals Up Now.
Agent: We're previously When we are licensed based on core utilization, you would have to smartly allocate how much compute power each application had, but now because we're essentially doing it based on messages and the complexity of a meal application, you are theoretically able to scale up your meal applications to be as large as reasonably you want them to be.
Agent: And so the actual processing of those isn't going to take too long, but I can't give approximate time, so that's all. about knowing . what kinds of transformations have been needed, what APIs you're connecting to.
Agent: But again, generally from my experience, it's the APIs that take a lot of time to collect that data from rather than the actual processing.
Speaker 7: And the ideal example, let's say the API works super fast. You've got 10 million in [TIME-8]. And you just need to do the same aggregation that you could do here, just not by [DATE-7], but by [TIME-7].
Agent: Let me see if I think we should have benchmarks within our org. So I'll take a look to see what I can find, and I'll add that as a follow-up item.
Speaker 7: Yeah, I mean, how comparable it is to highly optimized things like SQL Server.
Agent: Yeah, I would
Speaker 7: Say [TIME-9], days.
Agent: Yeah, I'll have to double check on that, but we're I think for 10 million records are probably talking under an hour potentially. But definitely not days to run. So it's not minutes.
EndUser: It's not days.
Agent: It's probably [TIME-10].
Speaker 7: I see. OK, thank you. I may have missed this.
Speaker 7: Can you tell me again how you're aggregating the data?
Speaker 7: And if we were doing that.
Speaker 7: Are we using that batch aggregator that you were showing on the right?
Agent: Yeah, so the aggregation itself is all being handled by this single script, which is essentially Taking all of the data and then it's going to group it based on the store number and the closed date here.
Agent: And then it's just providing me back with the some order totals based on the store number and closed data essentially.
Agent: So the batch aggregator is more so a way of managing multiple messages and breaking down the operations into chunks.
Agent: But when you're actually looking at how we're summing that information based on the store number and order date, that would all be handled through this single script essentially.
EndUser: But I guess how is that working behind the scenes?
EndUser: Are you storing this data somewhere?
EndUser: Are you storing it in memory, I guess?
Agent: To. In this case, it would be by memory, but it really depends on what you're looking to do.
Agent: So for example, I think you were mentioning a use case where right now, every time you want to do a refresh of the data, you essentially have to repall all of that data into the process and then essentially reprocess it [TIME-4], just because that's the way you do it.
Agent: But with meal stuff, there are a lot of ways that you can essentially that you can essentially handle that differently. We're just going into my solutioning hat, which isn't necessarily what I do now.
Agent: But it's something I've done in the past. What you might do, for example, is you might store the last date of data that you captured in the database.
Agent: And you might get all of the new orders since that date to the current date. All those records, some of those records based on the order date and the store number.
Agent: And then you might do a look up on the database currently storing those valleys to say hey, for this store, do we already have an order date for it If so, I need to add this valley into that existing valu e there, and that might all be done in memory or you might potentially, if you'r e worried about something happening during the process you might also do that in a staging table But it is something you could theoretically do all in [PERSON-34] y as well, based on how I've implemented similar thing s in the past .
EndUser: Do you have the concept of staging tables in your platform or would that be our own staging table?
Agent: So we have something called object store, which is a bit of a more it's more so meant for smaller volumes And so if you're looking to do something that's a lot a lot larger volume that might require your own staging table
EndUser: Okay
Agent: And the
EndUser: Point, the any point studio that you're running here, I don't, you had a slide earlier that was showing, I guess you can run in the cloud, you can run it on prem.
EndUser: You can run this on prem, but that's, you know, on prem meaning I guess in our own cloud or in a container or something.
EndUser: But the more common approach is to run in your cloud and then everything is happening there.
EndUser: So we have no infrastructure, is that right?
Agent: Yeah, so the only part that would have to be run on your local machine is any point studio where any point studio where you're actually building the APIs and integrations that would be done on your [PERSON-38] or on your PC.
Agent: We do have something called Code builder that's coming out or that has come out but is in a relative beta state which is cloud based where if you don't want to build on your machine, we have Code builder as an option where you can build in your web browser like some other iPASs But I think Studio is really the main plac e to be building your APIs and Integration s because it's been around for quite some [PERSON-41] e and really the time tested Enterprise level .
Agent: Builder essentially.
EndUser: So are we storing this like under get repo or something for versioning greatest story.
Agent: Or yeah there's the Yeah, so essentially any point studio, I don't know if you're familiar with [PRODUCT-6], but it's essentially a layer that's built on top of [PRODUCT-6] where anything [PRODUCT-6] can do around [PERSON-34] CD, around [LAW-1] management studio can do as well.
Agent: So you can integrate this with your existing [PERSON-41] repo so that anytime you save it, it commits it to Git.
Agent: You can also set up a CI CD Pipeline where when you commit this to [PERSON-41], it's going to run automated tests that you specify in your project.
Agent: Deploy it to your dev environment run test there if they succeed, go on to th e next environment, etc. But it's all very much possible . through [ORG-34].
EndUser: So when you, all the things on the left-hand side are packages?
Agent: Yeah, these are all different packages that I have on my local machine.
EndUser: And packages are basically jobs that are, that are, that could get deployed to the cloud where they're executed in the cloud?
Agent: Yep, exactly. They could be processes, they could be APIs, they could be pretty much any meal project essentially. Team
Agent: Start. Now, I just wanted to kind of quickly jump in. I just want to be respectful of everyone's time.
Agent: And like [PERSON-9] and team, just before we do head off the call, I know there was a lot that we covered, and there's probably still a lot more questions for us to dive into.
Agent: But I wanted to kind of talk a little bit about maybe next steps and what else you would like to see from [NORP-1], to feel confident and comfortable moving forward in a potential partnership.
Agent: So [PERSON-9], I know we chatted about price. That was something you're interested in covering, as well as you know.
Agent: Or what a partnership with [ORG-23] would look like So I do have that as a next step for [ORG-34] to really use [TIME-13] dive into what those options ar e and even those, you know the new funded programs that we do have as well So aside from that, you know what else maybe from a more technical standpoin t or, you know, anything that you and your tea m would like to see again just to feel confident in like [ORG-23] being that right solution for you guys .
EndUser: It's hard to compare the two solutions, to be honest, from my perspective, because they're very different. And [ORG-38] has a bit of a sexiness to it that is appealing on some levels.
EndUser: If you might hit the wall at certain points, and it's hard to tell when you're gonna hit the wall. So I don't know if I have anything immediately.
EndUser: I mean, this is definitely more kind of old school which is not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, it looks very powerful and you know, but you've got to have somebody, an engineer.
EndUser: Who's in doing this stuff, you know, that's one of their selling points is you could take a [LAW-2] or technical B.A.
EndUser: And build out integrations, but at what point do you hit the wall on that?
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: I guess just to jump into as someone who's used an easy to use I pass before.
Agent: It generally, it took me the same amount of time to onboard onto the [ORG-12] platform as it did for me to learn the other easy to use I pass because the thing with those I passes is that a [ORG-41] might be able to understand the high level flow of what it's doing, but to actually understand how data is being worked through that process it's always going to be a very a very difficult thing to learn And I myself, I don't have a technical degree I have a.. become in very high level business technology management type stuff.
Agent: And so I can personally attest to Essentially, an easy to use interface doesn't necessarily mean an easy to understand data Integration pipeline, where if you're integrating data, you have to learn how to work with data.
Agent: And that's really the key thing, where the tool you use honestly doesn't matter as much as how you understand what data is, how to maneuver, and how to play within what kinds of patterns to use, where once you know what patterns to use, the tool is essentially just using a different brand screwdriver.
Agent: Well, some screwdrivers they're electric they look a lot cooler bu t they're all going to get the job done regardless of what brand of tool you're using
EndUser: From my two quick final questions for me what is the onboarding like for someone to start getting proficient i get that you have your own scripting language and there's a good tutorial for that but Is it a matter of [DATE-8] to get somebody up to speed and writing an Integration or and do you have the learning that's one question and another is I want to know between real-time and that.
EndUser: Like are you doing more real-time [ORG-34] and. Like integrating from our website when something happens, goes to your platform and real-time connects to somebody else.
EndUser: Like if I want to retrieve a ticket from [ORG-23], is that a scenario thing more?
Agent: So I guess to answer the questions, firstly, we have full training courses and full training paths The main one, the Mule Developer Cert, that one is there's a free self-paced version that you can theoretically go into and take a look at.
Agent: Wishing.
Agent: That's essentially [DATE-8] of full-time learning or from my experience, [DATE-9] of a side of desk [TIME-12] a day or [TIME-17] a day of learning. And we also have certifications that ensure that.
Agent: If you are looking to hire a resource that might be familiar with Meals Up, if they have tha t cert, you know that they're someone who's fully capable in Meals Up.
Agent: And I think the othe r question was around real-time versus batch .
Agent: I'll go quickly on that one. You just before you jump in, on average, we've seen [DATE-10] as well for our developers to be onboarded. So it is a relatively quick process.
Agent: And that's the thing we can dive into our next call is those external resources and internal resources. We do have training as well Support that does our C4E.
EndUser: To provide
Agent: And again, that Mule-funded program where half of it is really designed around getting your team comfortable with the platform, trained with the platform and equipped to take it on as well. So it's not just giving you the.
Agent: Keys and having to drive off the lot, we do really want to make sure you have Support to be successful because that's really where the key issues fail, right With any tool that you select, it's just not having that proper education and [PERSON-38] an d place.
Agent: But I think regardless, you know, a tool that you use, there's going to be complexities, whether it's going to be at the start or it's going to be down the line with the different use Cases that you do have or projects that you do have.
Agent: So yeah, we're here to answer those questions, but [PERSON-10], back to you for the back in real time.
Agent: Perfect. From my experience, I mostly see [PRODUCT-2] use in places where you need those patterns. I know that's kind of a non-answer, but really again, the power of [PRODUCT-2] comes from being able to do.
Agent: Whatever you need to do with data in a single platform where I've seen a lot of customers say, hey, we're on workado, we need to do something that workado can't do, we need any point.
Agent: I've never, ever seen a customer say, hey, we need to do something any point so we need workado.
EndUser: Can't do,
EndUser: Got it. So if, Well, that's probably good enough. I think.
Agent: Oh, no, no worries. Hit us with it. Tell us what the question worked. Yeah.
EndUser: I'm just trying to think through like we're talking about a help ticketing Integration where we would bring tickets into thing time.
EndUser: And we display them and then the Customers, users could interact with like a sales force ticket inside of thing time and we would bring up the detail of the ticket.
EndUser: We might bring the ticket list over like through a batch synchronization or webhook or something. And now we've got the ticket list so we can show them with our tickets because we have a ticketing platform.
EndUser: And if you click on the ticket, it's going to bring up the detail of the ticket. That could be a real-time call. through your platform to get the details of the ticket.
EndUser: And then if I want to add a comment to the ticket, that could potentially be a call through your platform, right, to add a comment into the ticket.
EndUser: So I just was thinking, I was thinking the latter two were more real-time, their action oriented. The first one is more of a badge.
EndUser: Like would you mix those two two And is that the way you would architect that is just what was going through my head?
Agent: Yeah, it's definitely something that's definitely a use case.
Agent: I've seen quite a bit where I'm guessing that's where [PERSON-29] comes in and I think Zen desk was also mentioned where we have a connector for [PERSON-29] that can in real-time consume from a queue.
Agent: And we also have a connector for Zen desk that makes it easy to connect into that API as well.
EndUser: Did you show us where the jobs are executing.
Agent: Like so. Yeah, the jobs are executing in. run time manager. So Essentially, once I am happy with this application, I've tested it, then I'll deploy it into runtime manager.
Agent: And this is essentially where we're going to see all of the APIs that I currently have here.
Agent: In this case, I just have that [ORG-34] database API, but this is essentially where I can see, for example, the number of messages I've got, the CPU utilization memory.
Agent: I can also set alerts based on these thresholds, and I can also see directly here what the logging looks like and how healthy that application is essentially.
EndUser: Can you say like fail jobs?
Agent: Yeah, so if I had failed jobs, I would most likely see those in the log here where if I think. Yeah, so if I search for. Error, for example.
Agent: I don't think there are any errors here, but that would essentially very quickly summarize my log based on what that is.
Agent: And I can also add an additional threshold, such as the priority, the date and time of my log, etc. And if I have schedules, I can manage that directly in runtime manager.
Agent: And if I wanted to scale up, for example, I could also increase the size of my worker, for example, or if I needed high availability for a real-time process where I can't have the process fail, I can also add another worker so that I have two running in parallel.
EndUser: I think workado had a list of all of the jobs that were running. And sort of if a job had failed previously, I thought there was like an ex-onnet or something.
EndUser: And you can go into the job and try to rerun it and that kind of thing. It sounds, it seems like with your platform, you're more going into logs.
EndUser: And then I guess you could go find the job and then rerun it.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, I think it depends on what kind of process that you have where you can set up alerts to make sure that if something fails, you get an email sent to you, for example. .
Agent: And if you do have a scheduled process that fails, you can't. I honestly haven't done too many batch processes deployed on the runtime manager. I've mostly done them locally within my machine.
Agent: But I'll double check to see if you can similarly rerun the process immediately.
Agent: But I think generally speaking, when you have failures like that in the [ORG-12] platform, you want to handle those failures proactively so that you have an automatic retry built into your process here .
Agent: You know, if you have a, if you have an error record in your system that fails because of, because there's an error and you rerun it, that same record is going to fail again.
Agent: And so the best practice is generally to make sure that you do something with that error record, whether it be catalog it, whether it be excluded for the next time you run it, so that you're able to make sure the next time you run that process, you're not going to get that same failure.
EndUser: Yeah, it is. Okay.
EndUser: But you can tell your job to retry, if it's, yeah, but if it fails sort of midstream, then I guess it's how you wrote the job and whether you retry the entire job or like you said, you could pick some jobs up in the middle again.
Agent: Like
EndUser: It just depends on how the job is written.
EndUser: Is that right?
Agent: Okay. So,
Agent: Well, I just want to kind of quickly touch on before we go.
Agent: If there is more that you do want to see from a technical standpoint, I want to make sure that we do cover it before we do move on.
Agent: And so, just taking notes, is there anything else that you do need to see?
Agent: You know, outside of, I know you just asked those two questions around batch in real time, but like, what else would you like that maybe we can provide?
Agent: I can promise that meal stuff is also a <inaudible> tool, so I want to ensure that you can see it that way as well.
EndUser: Yeah, I need to debrief with the team see.
Agent: To
EndUser: I mean, I think a lot of my questions were answered. But let me get back to you on that once I've talked to the team.
Agent: Perfect. So then what it makes sense while you deep read with your team, we can set up a separate call for the pricing and then what this partnership would look like and maybe some of the Contract options.
EndUser: Okay. Yeah, that would be great.
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: Are you around [DATE-13]?
Agent: Does that work?
Agent: I just figured getting you the information as soon as possible might be best.
EndUser: Yeah, that would be great. I'm around a week.
Agent: Perfect. You never know. I feel like it's a cheeky time for holidays.
Agent: Okay, is there a date that works best for you?
Agent: And is anyone else from the team that I should include in the call?
Agent: Just the whole lot
EndUser: Or just you?
EndUser: You could just conclude me I think. It's fine.
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: How is [DATE-12] for you?
Agent: That seems to be kind of an open day for us as well as the [DATE-17]. We do have some company-wide training on the [DATE-17].
EndUser: What day did you say [DATE-12] or [DATE-17]?
Agent: Say [DATE-12] and then actually working.
EndUser: I am Yeah. I mean, it's just misspoke earlier. We've got a outside meeting in [GPE-7] on [DATE-17], [DATE-12]. And so let's, uh, or wait, after.
EndUser: Wait. That's the week Okay.
EndUser: I've got 9101 to 10 on [DATE-12], 789 to 13.
Agent: Is this [ORG-41], Thank you.
EndUser: [DATE-12]?
EndUser: In [TIME-17], it's in [DATE-12].
Agent: Okay, perfect.
Agent: It's like, can you repeat that one more time?
EndUser: To, I could speak [ORG-41] if we want.
Agent: No worries, I'm just checking our, across our calendars as well.
EndUser: [ORG-41], 741 [ORG-41], 2PM Eastern,
Agent: Um, what about on the [DATE-17], did you say you could do potentially, let me see. Sorry, I think if we do [TIME-12], we can be able to cover.
Agent: So would you be able to do maybe [TIME-17], central on [DATE-17] the seventh?
EndUser: Uh, on the seventh.
EndUser: Is there any other time?
Agent: Um, I think we could probably do. Like [TIME-21] as well.
EndUser: I could. I could do one on.
EndUser: [DATE-17],
EndUser: [DATE-21] or [DATE-17].
Agent: Okay. Perfect. And just confirming [PERSON-10]. That works for you as well. Right. I have your calendar up, but. So I'm going to double check.
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Okay. Perfect. Let me send that out then, [PERSON-4], and we can always change it too if need be.
EndUser: Okay, sounds good.
Agent: Perfect. And I'll send over the Recording as well for your team to review in the meantime.
EndUser: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it.
EndUser: Take care. Bye.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer seemed to feel that the seller's product, [NORP-1], has the potential to meet their needs, but they also expressed interest in comparing it with another product, Workado. They mentioned that Workado has a better UI for building integrations, and they also brought up differences in pricing models between the two products. However, they also acknowledged the value proposition of [NORP-1] and its ability to reuse assets, which they found appealing. Overall, while the customer seems to be considering both options, they did not express any major concerns or issues with [NORP-1]'s ability to meet their needs.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential for reuse and the management capabilities of the seller's product. They specifically mentioned the ability to have a management system for integrations, and the potential to reuse assets for different projects. They also mentioned the possibility of having a place to go when integrations fail, which would allow them to see what's happening. Additionally, they seemed interested in the ability to connect to a variety of things and not having to build everything from scratch.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's background, their current technology stack, and their specific pain points. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their pitch to better address the customer's needs.

2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's use case for the product, such as the specific systems they want to integrate and the data they want to aggregate. This would have helped the sales rep provide a more detailed demonstration and answer the customer's questions more effectively.

3. The sales rep could have spent more time explaining the differences between connectors and APIs, as the customer seemed to be confused about this. This would have helped the customer better understand the product and its capabilities.

4. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's budget and decision-making process. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's needs and provide a more tailored solution.

5. The sales rep could have asked for feedback on the demo and addressed any concerns or questions the customer had. This would have helped build trust and confidence in the product.

6. The sales rep could have asked if there were any other stakeholders who needed to be involved in the decision-making process and if so, invited them to the next call. This would have helped ensure that all decision-makers were on the same page and that the sales rep had a complete understanding of the customer's needs.",What were the topics most discussed around our competitors?,"During the sales call, the main competitor that was discussed was Workado. The customer brought up the topic of comparing the seller's product with Workado, mentioning that they are finalists and that they have a different approach. The customer specifically mentioned that Workado has a better UI for building integrations and a consumption-based model for pricing, while the seller's product charges by cores. The customer also mentioned that they have been talking to others as well and that re-use is a big factor for them, as well as management around integrations.

Additionally, the customer mentioned another competitor, [PERSON-23], which has a pretty slick UI for building integrations. However, the seller did not go into detail about this competitor.

In summary, the main competitor discussed during the sales call was Workado, with a focus on their UI, pricing model, and approach to integration. The seller did not provide much detail about the other competitor mentioned, [PERSON-23].",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1.

2. Question: ""So maybe it's really sometime maybe at the end to talk on that and maybe [PERSON-10], as you go, if you have differentiators you know of maybe call them out just so we have a good sense.""
   Answer: The customer was engaged in discussing the differentiators between the seller's product and Workado, particularly in terms of UI and pricing models.

3. Question: ""And so, I guess to begin my slide, I think this is one of the key differentiators of me all soft actually is... We can Support any Integration pattern, whether that be APIs and the more batch style integrations we'll be talking about [DATE-1], but also potentially around real-time integrations, IoT, where if you want to capture real-time streaming data from your stores, for example, directly from the [PERSON-29] systems, these are all Use Cases that we Support.""
   Answer: The customer seemed more engaged as they inquired about the concept of account or sub-account in a true multi-tenant way, indicating their interest in the platform's capabilities.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer was interested in comparing the seller's product with a competitor called Workado, specifically in terms of their approaches and pricing models.
2. The customer mentioned that Workado has a better UI for building integrations, while the seller's product requires building connectors and might be more complex.
3. The customer was unsure about the onboarding process and how long it would take to get proficient in using the seller's product.
4. The customer also wanted to understand the balance between batch and real-time processing capabilities in the seller's product.

Answer to any other questions is unclear, as there were no other concerns explicitly mentioned in the transcript.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: Based on the transcript, it is unclear if the right decision maker was on the call to move the deal forward. The customer mentions that they are the CTO of [ORG-1] and that [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] report to them. However, they also mention that they need to debrief with their team before making a decision. The agreed-upon next steps include the seller sending over a recording of the call for the customer's team to review and setting up a separate call for pricing and discussing what a partnership would look like, including some of the contract options. The customer mentioned that they are available on [DATE-12] and [DATE-17] for the next call.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was not explicitly stated. However, they mentioned that it's hard to compare the two solutions and that the seller's product seems more old-school but powerful. They also had questions about onboarding and real-time capabilities, which indicates they are still considering the product. They agreed to a follow-up call to discuss pricing and partnership details. Overall, while they didn't reject the deal, they also didn't express clear enthusiasm."

Agent: Sounds good.
Agent: So I know I didn't have this in the agenda, but just a really quick objective line and just boilerplate slide for us to lean into if we need, you know, as the, you know, for successful moving forward.
Agent: But the objectives, I think, just so that we're not necessarily just trying to say, hey, you know, we can provide you with technology, like we're talking about certain pieces because we know there's business, business objectives behind it.
Agent: The key ones being, you know, doubling your Revenue that [DATE-1] from [DATE-2], that's a key focus. The increased pipeline, so happy. against what you're currently doing to start matching some of that Revenue expectations .
Agent: And then I think the biggest piece here is data driven decision making.
Agent: It's a broad statement, but when I think about the feedback from [PERSON-1], it's having the opportunity to say, here's our [PRODUCT-1] by source, what's working, what's not working.
Agent: And that's maybe a board level type exercise, but then bringing that down to the scale of the operational side and saying, Here's what's working, here's what's not working, here's where we can make tweaks and actually see the impacts real time.
Agent: That's what we're thinking of as kind of the three core business objectives. Your use cases, it's Marketing analytics number one. I think that was [DATE-3], the operationalized customer journey and the automated scaling of the technology.
Agent: Those are kind of table stakes, but it should all lend itself to the opportunity to provide really strong analytics. The technical requirements, this is a laundry list of the different things that we're going to cover off [DATE-4].
Agent: So we don't need to go through it, but the key things again, how we handle Marketing data, the way that we operationalize that customer journey, and then where the benefits come from being directly integrated with the [PRODUCT-2] versus the notorious [PERSON-2] OAPI to anything and everything conversation.
Agent: The last piece is the implementation.
Agent: As you're aware, we are at [DATE-5], so that's where we're going to drive the best incentive, best timeline, and just in terms of your Marchettos shut off date, you know, this is [DATE-6] you'd have to make a decision.
Agent: [DATE-7] and [DATE-8], we're going to be really focused on the actual mapping and integration. We have a slide after the demonstration that will outline how we see that kind of laying out just to help guide [PERSON-3]' proposal.
Agent: And then, you know, we want to be ready to switch off [ORG-1] when that contract's done and have you at a spot where we're like, we're using the tool the way that we would have expected to do it and then spend that additional time after that.
Agent: Which hopefully, which would stay still within [DATE-9], just knowing when you guys are aligned to us and really refine the reporting and analytics to that from an operational perspective, you're saying, you know, we're apples to apples what we're doing.
Agent: We made the shift and now we can actually shift our focus in [DATE-10] to the reporting and the analytics and what's going to drive the business for the rest of [DATE-13].
Agent: So boilerplate slide, but this field in line with expectations where
Speaker 6: Your leadership teams are going to say this is a good move to make. I don't think I'm going to do it. Absolutely.
Agent: I did work with him, [PERSON-4].
Speaker 6: He will be joining us
Agent: Via phone unfortunately. He will be joining us in defense. Awesome. So [PERSON-5], you're going to be up for a lot more verbal explanation than visual I challenge, but challenge accepted.
Agent: [DATE-14]. So don't envy you necessarily,
Agent: And yeah, [PERSON-3] and I'll do our part to add the color where we need to. So awesome.
Agent: Anything else on this or anything chatted that would shift anything on here?
Speaker 6: Changed fundamentally between when we've
Agent: No, I think this looks good. Awesome. Oh yeah, I will go ahead and stop sharing. I'm done filibustering or kind of feel some space here, but [PERSON-5], I will pass this
Agent: To you and yeah, let you move rock on now. Awesome. Perfect. Let me go ahead and share my screen. And as we're going through [DATE-4], obviously want to keep this conversational.
Agent: So you may ask questions at any point, use the chat, use the raised hand emoji at the bottom there.
Agent: And all pause, of course, as we're going throughout as well, just to make sure we're on the right track, answering anything from a strategic perspective to But really want to make sure that we're kind of focusing on some of the key things that [PERSON-6], [PERSON-7], we spoke about previously, as well as RFPs, anything that's top of mind for you as well, we can absolutely pivot and talk about some of those things too.
Agent: Of course, on [GPE-1] hops on as well, we can make sure to realign with him and what he's hoping to see for [DATE-4].
Agent: But overall, we're going to focus first on sort of [DATE-13] side understanding how you can use account engagement, access sort of those key features that like building out a segmentation list, creating an automation, building ou t content.
Agent: And then we'll spend sort of the second half really diving into [FAC-1] and analytics side.
Agent: So understanding how we know what's working, what's not working what sort of comes out of the box and how you can also customize all of this data, al l of these reports to be specific to your business.
Agent: The final thing that we'll touch on too i s just what sales would see, just that you have an idea of how all the data is shared [ORG-2] your organization and how being on one [ORG-3] platform makes things very easy for you, of course, on the Marketing sid e, but then again, showing what's happening
Speaker 6: To the Sales team as [PERSON-8] before we get started?
Agent: Any initial questions?
Speaker 6: Sound like a good [PERSON-9] e?
Speaker 6: Cool, I just wanted to. We said it was going to be [DATE-14].
Agent: It's the rates here users over [DATE-11].
Agent: Just on any less random
Agent: That's what that's what you want. Adario. Awesome, cool. We can go ahead then and get started. Perfect. So here we are in the [ORG-4] platform.
Agent: So this is our B2B [ORG-5] tool built on top of the Salesforce Lightning platform. So again, you're familiar with this, but the nice thing is you can just switch back and forth easily between Marketing and sales.
Agent: We have access to all of your leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities, and campaigns across Marketing and sales. We use the same key to... data points, same fields, whether they're default and custom .
Agent: Don't have to worry about hitting API limits . don't have to worry about things being out of date . if something updates on the sales side , will reflect on the Marketing side too .
Agent: So that's what I wanted to start off with , how this data is sort of used, what we're tracking , how this is something that's going to be accessible to bot h the Marketing team as well as to your sales team too .
Agent: We're starting off here looking at [PERSON-10]. He has a lead here.
Agent: As you can see, we're still in the Account Engagement side, but this is also going to be the same view that your sales team would see in the actual sales for [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: I can see everything that [PERSON-10] has been doing behind the scenes from a Marketing perspective.
Agent: What forms he's engaged with, what pages on the website he's interacted with, what landing page is he's viewed, if he engaged with any of our links, if he engaged with a [ORG-6] ad, if he's been sent, opened, or quickly.
Agent: And email, you can even pull in third-party data sources here too Like if you use Zoom webinar, understand if he interacted with a specific webinar, i f he registered, if he attended And what's really nice too is that both you and your sales teams can also dive into thi s information really easily and strategically For example, if I wanted to come in and see which events [PERSON-10] might have registered for looks like he viewed the form to register, but never actually successfully complete d that Now I can use that as a Sales rep to either follow up and call or if I'm looking at him from that Marketing perspective to just sort of see where things might drop off, making sure that if I have key individuals key contacts that I'm keeping them engage as well.
Agent: Of course, since we're tracking all of these different Marketing activities, it gives me a lot of flexibility on the actual scoring side of things too.
Agent: So, [PERSON-6], know that this is something that's top of mind for you, making sure that you can have some of that flexibility. Thank you. when it comes to understanding these different behaviors.
Agent: We offer an out-of-the-box scoring model, so we are paying attention to all of those different behaviors and giving everyone an individual behavior-based score.
Agent: You can absolutely customize this or just sort of turn on the out-of-the-box model to get things started. And we also break that up with the demographic grading too.
Agent: This is really helpful as well to make sure that you can pay attention to not just are we getting people who are interested, but are we getting the right people interested in us that separation is huge because you can use this in segmentation lists from the Marketing side, from a reporting standpoint on the Marketing side, as well as directly for the sales teams, they can see it too to ensure they understand what's working, what's not working, and who do I need to be actually reaching out to as well.
Agent: So this view is a really nice, easy view, just so you know as well from a Marketing perspective.
Agent: If you ever wanted to see a more detailed view, you have that same view here of [PERSON-10] of the breakdown of all of those different interactions and how that score plays out.
Agent: But for that more day-to-day approach, being able to just see this at a quick glance, see what [PERSON-10]'s been doing behind the scenes so helpful for everybody across your organization.
Agent: The final thing I want to touch on here is that in addition to the that out of the box rule-based score and grade , do also offer [ORG-7] scoring and grading as well , is what you're seeing here with [PERSON-13] .
Agent: Love to just kind of pause and see , AI something that you're interested in exploring more ?
Agent: That something that's part of your roadma p for the future of functionalit y that you'd like to have access to ?
Speaker 6: Yes, absolutely. Yeah, we were, you know, we've kind of gone away from Lead Scoring and whatnot, but yeah, that is, you know, with the, we want to be able to iterate, I think lead scoring.
Agent: In its
Speaker 6: Traditional form is not, is dead, but I bet there is new models approaching and more intelligence coming in and using the data to really prescribe so that is the key here is perfectly that.
Agent: So yes,
Agent: Scoring instead of just traditionally scoring. Awesome, let's definitely dive into that then here too. So what's great is that of course you'll still have that rule based scoring and grading.
Agent: So to your point [PERSON-6], if you just wanted to kind of level set and see how things are working, you have that option.
Agent: The great thing about the [ORG-7] scoring is that we offer again that more demographic score here. As you can see, we're paying attention to key attributes like location, job title, et cetera, and that behavior approach too.
Agent: [PERSON-13] is looking specifically at your data. So understand.
Agent: What works for your business What Content are you creating Who are you engaging with Looking at what opportunities actually close looking at what accounts convert So all of that data is going to be specific to your busines s and [PERSON-13] is constantly learnin g and making adjustments based off of, again what's happening within your organization So really helpful The other really nice feature about [ORG-8] n is that it will always be out of 105 for these scores So very easy to digest, both for marketer s Sales teams, sales can still access this informatio n, create reports around i t. And the other great thing about [PERSON-13] too is that it will also give you those specific reasons why someone is scored that way.
Agent: So as I showed, you can absolutely come in and sort of see that full breakdown of what [PERSON-10]'s been doing in all of those different touchpoints.
Agent: But Einstein really filters that through for you and just says, hey, these are the key reasons why [PERSON-10] is a good fit based off of his events, based off of his email engagement, and based off of his webinar attendance too.
Agent: So this allows you to really also then understand.
Agent: What channel should we be focusing on Where should we be focusing our time and effort And for sales, of course, too, the y can get a better level who should I actuall y be reaching
Agent: Set of out to Is this helpful Making sure that I can have that insigh t into what's happening behind the scenes So I'm going to take a look at that .
Agent: And I think the one thing they call out here is just as we're, I know if you're on, you know, you're kind of listening in.
Agent: The one thing that [PERSON-5]'s definitely doing is toggling kind of, you know, between two views. One is a view that's available on the sales side of it.
Agent: And then the other view is sort of the operational side in the Marketing environment. So there's always going to be a really tangible, easy way for anyone who is looking to get Marketing insights, understand, you know, how.
Agent: What kind of activity history or activity records someone is taking on or someone from a prospect or lead perspective, you know, has associated them.
Agent: You don't necessarily like you don't have to be in the Marketing lens to do that. That information is really easily and tangibly available on the Sales Cloud side.
Agent: So for those that aren't living in the Marketing tools, all of that information that's relevant. That's the effectiveness and the results of what that Marketing operations. execution is, that's all available on the other side of the CRM
Agent: [PERSON-14] so that you don't have to have everyone in a Marketing environment to see the results of what's happening on the Marketing side. Yeah, great point again, just making sure that is completely visible across the board.
Agent: Two sales, two Marketing doesn't matter sort of which side of the business you're in.
Agent: From that sort of [ORG-7] scoring side of things or anything else about sort of those engagement history dashboards where I can come in and see what's happening behind the scenes with more specific data points, the rule based scoring grading any questions here, or should we keep moving.
Agent: [PERSON-13], anything on your own?
Agent: We're good. Perfect. Awesome. Let's talk about using this data. So one basic feature that we definitely want to touch on, because it's important, but probably something you're familiar with is these rule-based segmentation lists.
Agent: Again, you have access to all of those different data points.
Agent: We just talked through information from [ORG-3] directly, like those default or custom fields, information directly from marketing, like what form or landing page someone has interacted with, also data from things like opportunity.
Agent: So this can be really great for things like if you wanted to run a campaign for close lost opportunities for re-engagement programs I can just click that drop down, have a full list here of anyone who sort of fits this criteria And [ORG-4] will do the work of finding anyone who's in [GPE-2], [GPE-3], [GPE-4] whose current solution includes [ORG-9], which I know [PERSON-6], we talked about That's a big focus for you [DATE-17] And also we can do that re-engagement program for maybe opportunities that we've lost in the past so we can make sure any time someone fi ts of these rules they will be adde d. And then the great thing too, since these are constant ly updating, people if they no longer fit these rul es will be remove d. You can also use things too outside of sort of what I' ve built out here, like the [PERSON-13] score and [ORG-10] that we were just talking through, account informati on as well if you're really focused on an [ORG-13] approac h. So it gives you so much flexibili ty to [ORG-14] these different [ORG-13] and just set it up and let i t. run and never have to worry about manually updating a list or worrying about things be ing out of sync between your [ORG-3] database and whatever Marketing tool you're using since t his becomes one singular system.
Agent: So I'll pause from that sort of segmentation side of thin gs, though that this was sort of maybe top of mind for you, [PERSON-6], [PERSON-14], if you have any questions or thoughts too,
Agent: But again, very easy, very straightforward to use, still very powerful. So happy to answer anything that's top of mind here t oo.
Agent: Is there a place where I can look for the specific fields just so I can compare it with [ORG-14]?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. I can send over sort of like the overall list. I'll just show you this drop down here. And then if you watch the recording, you can kind of see.
Agent: But again, some of it's going to be specific to your data that you have in your [ORG-3] database. And then anything, of course, that you're tracking from the Marketing side.
Agent: So things like default or custom fields, that's again pulled directly from your instance. Same from like account field information. But things like the opportunity status, fields, all of that. Again, everything I'm showing here is going to be included.
Speaker 6: Included usable data . So this is similar to a smart list.
Agent: Yeah, so [PERSON-14] from
Agent: Our perspective,
Speaker 6: Smart list, yeah. Right, exactly. So, but it incorporates a little bit easier, I think, because A, most of the data that we use in smart lists in [ORG-14] is pulled from [ORG-3] and is not always well organized.
Speaker 6: So, this would potentially make it a lot easier, a lot more streamlined to thinking it just in [ORG-3] fields versus [ORG-3]
Agent: And Marketo fields, because we
Agent: Sometimes have a merge of two. Right. Yeah, and that's also something that [PERSON-3] and his team, if you do have any fields that are unique to [PERSON-11] that you want to make sure are still accessible.
Agent: Once you come over to account engagement, [PERSON-3] and his team can also make sure to set that up during the Implementation process as well.
Speaker 7: Awesome. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry, [PERSON-5]. Yeah, just real quick. So, [PERSON-6], what we typically recommend is when you get a trying engagement set up.
Speaker 7: Rather than duplicating some of your setup rules and stuff from [ORG-14], we want to show you the out-of-the-box field and functionality that you get right away.
Speaker 7: And then if you do want to incorporate some of the customizations that you have from [ORG-14], you can do that down the line. But it's sort of the crawl walk run approach that [PERSON-17] has talked about.
Speaker 7: We definitely recommend that if that's... how you feel, but if you're like, hey, we want to duplicate [PERSON-11] out of the gate for some reason.
Speaker 6: I just I got to just kind of want to know where you stand. We don't have any one particular way. I honestly have not put enough thought into the migration, you know, of all of that.
Speaker 6: So realistically right now we're still we're still in the in the is this what we need to do this now?
Speaker 6: Or is this is this something we do on the road now?
Speaker 6: So that's kind of where we're at currently. But I wouldn't want to Oh, I'd want to do best practices for salesforce
Speaker 7: Just duplicate what we have a market.
Speaker 7: Because yeah, so that's where we're at with that Yep,
Speaker 6: Makes sense you get you have a chance to improve your profit
Agent: And it's a great it's a good exercise. So yeah, absolutely [PERSON-21]. Let's keep going again. And then we can talk a little bit more about the [ORG-11] creation side. Just want to make sure that we're touching on that.
Agent: So you have an idea of how to build content, what's possible, et cetera.
Agent: When it comes to content, obviously, as we showed, lots of different types of Content that you can create, like forms, landing pages, emails, social posts for [ORG-17] and [ORG-11], integrations with third party tools. So lots of options.
Agent: I know right now it sounds like you're mostly using the free. for email creation, an [ORG-21]-bounce , sounds like for landing pages , can absolutely continue to use those .
Agent: Just so that you know , offer multiple ways of creating [ORG-11] here in [ORG-4] . is our drag and drop email builder .
Agent: Do also offer some out of the box template s and a full HTML builder that also is [PERSON-21] d on the landing page side of things too .
Agent: With the drag and drop builder , easy to do, very quick , you can build [ORG-11] , still have lots of flexibility .
Agent: Here is is customizable, so I have my layou t, which act as that [NORP-1] k. I can pull those in and then adjust on the f ly to, of course, make those changes as neede d. I then can pull in text, images, buttons, or even [ORG-21] into these different sort of columns of my messa ge so that I have those levels of [ORG-23] We, of course, also offer access to all of your fiel ds across Marketing and sale s. So through merge fields, you can make [PERSON-23] re to [ORG-14] your message s. So keeps things really easy and.
Agent: Organize so that you don't have to again worry about things being out of [PERSON-21]. And we do also offer the ability to pull in dynamic conte nt.
Agent: So I can show you what that would look like in a preview where you could do it based off of any fields that live within [ORG-3], whether it be someone's job title, someone's engagement [ORG-21] re, someone's location.
Agent: So in this case we're actually making sure that if [NORP-2] e's in [GPE-2] we're inviting them to an in-person event that we're having in [GPE-5] and I'll show you that preview in a [GPE-6] nd.
Agent: But before I do that ... wanted to pause, see if you have any questions on the [ORG-11] side of things.
Agent: Again, you can really pick and choose how you want to build out content, lots of options, but again, we want to make sure we're hitting perspective.
Agent: The mark on what you're hoping to have from a functionality
Agent: I'm assuming you have a cloning feature, right?
Agent: Yes, absolutely. So if you wanted to either clone the entire message, you can also save this as you like even a template.
Agent: So for example, I have like a newsletter template and then I can just use that every time I wanted to make a newsletter and just change the text.
Agent: But you can also
Speaker 6: Clone specific sort of aspects of the message to this really streamlined like thank you emails, post events, stuff like that stuff.
Agent: Okay. So
Speaker 6: Totally.
Agent: We use a very similar template.
Agent: It's just kind of
Speaker 6: Plug and play different texts and whatnot. Yeah. And it's all with one platform.
Agent: So it would all it just it would be it would be convenient to not have to go to a separate platform for this. Definitely.
Agent: Another nice thing about these is that you can even make some of these templates if you wanted accessible to sales so that if it's a webinar invite, and you want sales to also be able to invite people, they can send it as a template directly via [ORG-3] too.
Agent: And so that's something you have control over, which is so beneficial being on that one platform.
Agent: And again, can still have all of those merge fields, can still have that dynamic [ORG-11] so that sales can just say, hey, I just spoke to this lead, want to send it out, not a problem.
Agent: Here's that cloning feature .
Agent: I can save this more as a template , then just to show you that dynamic [ORG-11] side , I preview this, we can make sure to pull i n that specific information for [PERSON-10] , he's based here in [GPE-2] .
Agent: Inviting him to the event
Agent: , for people outside, they would not see that in invites . That's pretty cool.
Agent: Yeah, really helpful, easy and just again, one less step that you have to take when you're building out content, but we can there's any other questions on the [ORG-11] side.
Speaker 6: Keep going then unless
Agent: I think we're good. No. OK, perfect. So let's talk about actually guiding that journey. You can, of course, do one off send.
Agent: So if I just wanted to send this out, not a problem, I can click that button, send it, and have it go. But let's talk more about the actual automation side.
Agent: Because I think that that's probably the majority of types of messages that you'll be creating is more of that guided journey. So here, what we're looking at istheengagementstudio in [PERSON-4].
Agent: This is where you can have that sort of decision tree feeling of building out a. a great program for a different audience You have a variety of different ways to interact .
Agent: Of course, you can create different types of engagement studio programs for different situations. This is more of maybe like a [DATE-11] newsletter program for new individuals who are not existing customers is what I've built out here.
Agent: But you could have one again for more of an account-based Marketing approach for key accounts and have that sort of flow. You can have one for that sort of [ORG-9] conversation that you're really running at for [DATE-2].
Agent: You can have one for re-engagement of dead opportunities or upsells for current customers.
Agent: Possibilities are endless And again, that's something that [PERSON-3] and his team if you have existing sort of automation setup can help migrate over as well First off, you can choose exactly who you want to send to So it can be one of those dynamic lists And we can suppress individuals makes things really easy And I really like this visual vie w as opposed to sometimes it's more of that tabular vie w that you might be used to in Marquette- O because it's so easy to just come i n and see what I can do and what's possible a variety of ways to interact, actions which are doing things like sending out an emai l, but I can even pull in external sources into these actions too, like did someone register or atte nd a webinar that we ran?
Speaker 6: Too It
Agent: I can also see things like aligning to the sales process, so making [PERSON-23] re if this is a new lead, getting it over to the right team member based off of rules already s et up in [ORG-3] or making little adjustments on the fly by adding someone to a different li st or a different [ORG-3] campaign to o. I have this behavior-based approach here through [ORG-24].
Agent: So things like did they download a white pap er, view a landing page, open an ema il, click the link, e tc.
Agent: Then I finally have rules which is paying attention to aga in, that data across your [ORG-3] instan ce, default and custom fiel ds, anything like simple things like who is the assigned us er.
Agent: So making sure that again, if this is a key account for one of our top reps, we can ensure that we're getting it to him or her right ay. anything slipped through the cra cks.
Agent: This flow, very sim ple. We're going to go ahead and send out that newslet ter, wait [DATE-21] to see how people inter act.
Agent: If someone clicks on one of the links in this mes sage that we've sent out, they'll get passed down this yes path to the right where we create a [ORG-3] t ask, goes to the person assigned in your [PRODUCT-2], your team gets notified in [ORG-3] via e mail and even via [ORG-21] if you l ike.
Agent: You can provide those due dates and remind ers, and we can continue building out that automated appr oach if we want to. or just have that conversation end there.
Agent: Really easy and flexible and you can test these t oo so that before they run, make sure that they're kind of working the way that they want and if it's like events, you can ensure that this is getting out before or product updates, make sure that people know about those before the actual product release hap pens.
Agent: So very nice and flexible and you will also get full reporting on these as well, which is really great if you're trying to take a look to see how are things working, what do we need to change and you can make adjustments to any active program as well,
Agent: So you're not just locked in. [PERSON-7], no, you came up muted.
Agent: You have something to add?
Agent: Yeah, so as I say, from the perspective of, This would maybe be less on the like the Revenue Pipeline performance, but in terms of success and real-time measurement of how people are flowing through your campaigns.
Agent: I think this is just a really good sort of first instance of where you're going to start seeing that real-time analytics and that real-time data on what performance and and results look like.
Agent: And this definitely takes it from the operational perspective of how you have people moving through your campaigns and your engagements. that you've set up and your flows.
Agent: But this will definitely relay into when you're looking at some of the campaign results and some of the Marketing analytics to say, hey, was this campaign generally a success?
Agent: We can also go back and in real-time sort of cross analyze how people were flow, how prospects were flowing through and the check marks that they did.
Agent: So you're really starting to paint the full picture, not just of the perspective of here's what the impact of was the impact of the campaign was.
Agent: But also the way that the campaign operated to say, do the two pictures line up side by side, and where exactly can we start making tweaks for certain results
Speaker 6: Ever after?
Agent: And I think, [PERSON-7], you kind of nailed that there.
Agent: Any additional questions or feedback on building out these sort of engagement studio programs?
Agent: Again, having that flexibility to kind of see what's working, where you might want to make adjustments, very helpful. So I would love to just get any If you have any, or we
Speaker 6: Additional thoughts, too.
Agent: Can keep moving on. Nothing on my end. Perfect. I think it looks a lot like [PRODUCT-3], which I've used for a
Speaker 6: [DATE-21], and I
Agent: Really like that. So I just like being able to see it visually. Totally. Yeah, that's my preference too. I really like it. And like you said, it's kind of similar to that sort of [PRODUCT-3] look and feel.
Agent: Again, it's just nice because it's on the same platform as the rest of your [ORG-3] org. So it just makes things that's much easier to use the data, and you don't have to worry about.
Agent: Again, anything being different, anything being off, or even just hitting API limits, which is such a pain sometimes to have to worry about. We can keep going and talk a little bit more about the reporting side.
Agent: So everything that I'm going to be showing from the reporting perspective is out of the box reporting.
Agent: Just keep in mind too that you can absolutely create custom reports, but we're really focusing on what you're going to get from [DATE-23] one perspective so that you can really hit the ground running, see what's working, make adjustments, and understand from that sort of more real time, in depth perspective of how is this directly impacting not just marketing, but the... overarching sales process too.
Agent: So the first thing that I really want to dive into is the campaig n object itself. Like I mentioned at the beginning, we use the same leads, contacts, accounts opportunity, and campaign object across Marketing and sales.
Agent: And so by using the same [ORG-23] object, it really allows us to sort of build a strong foundation of ROI, understanding how w e impact sales.
Agent: And then you'll see a little in sort of [TIME-1] how this sort o f of all works together to give you more in-depth reporti ng across the board for ROI, attribution, et [PERSON-24]: On the campaign object, we can see a varie ty of different data points, like how many opportuniti es we've generated from this customer [ORG-23], how many one opportunities we've create d, the campaign ROI, let me just zoom in a little bit the re for [PERSON-21] campaign ROI, value of opportunities, where people are in the actual opportunity cycle.
Agent: So we have the discovery phase all the way to close one stage. I can also see all of the assets associated with this campaign too.
Agent: So if I just wanted to get a quick glance at sort of engagement metrics on these landing pages, emails, forms, I can see how everything compares.
Agent: But if I want to as well, I can actually click on any of these and I have one up where I can take a deeper view with things like a heat.
Agent: Or Interaction reports, so gives me options to dive into that data further And then finally, though, I really want to talk about these engagement history dashboards This is sort of what we saw with [PERSON-10] already, looking at an individual perspective earlier But now we can see the engagement history for this campaign So it's really nice as we can see things like spikes in engagement for the campaign So how are people actually moving through this campaign We can see, hey, we had a forum .
Agent: That we sort of went live on the sixth, but people didn't really start filling it out until the 13th.
Agent: So building that into our programs, having that insight is really beneficial to make sure that we're getting sort of the right marks.
Agent: We can see every individual who's part of this campaign as well and what they've done most recently, but to help with that sort of [ORG-13] approach too, I can dive into specifics like green fields.
Agent: I can see only [LOC-1] has interacted. So that's very nice to understand we need to be.
Agent: [ORG-21] with [PERSON-23]'s let's work with the account team there to make sure that we have th e right contacts involved, make sure that we can invite the right people to this event so that [ORG-37] e really ensuring that [ORG-13] approach right away as we're sort of starting off looking at thi s individual campaign.
Agent: So again, having all of this information at
Agent: The campaign level so helpful, so beneficial, and again, it's that same campaign object across Marketing and sales but I thin k I think I heard someone come off mute.
Agent: I'm not sure [PERSON-21] Yeah, I think the only thing I'll add here is, [PERSON-37], I know if you're not necessarily looking at this like virtually right now.
Agent: The way that we're demonstrating this campaign is, yeah, we're looking at it within the [ORG-4] lens, but all of this information is going to be available on the sales [PRODUCT-2] record as well at the campaign level.
Agent: So you're not going to have to go into the system, dig into Marketing records to dig into the platform to really understand.
Agent: This is going to be like the demarc, this is going to be available across the entire business so that, you know, from a head of or leadership position, you know, you can go in and specifically look at this campaign and how it's executing and see the results without having to go pull substantial reports or spend time trying to collect the data.
Agent: It's aggregated into a single spot. all again, all real-time and all realistically against the objectives of the campaign that, you know, you may have set at a business decision
Agent: Level, but not necessarily having to aggregate all that data to actually form this lens to how the campaign is performing.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Again, something accessible to both Marketing and to sales no matter which side of the business you're on too. Thanks for watching. Have a good day. Have a good day. Have a good day. Have a good day.
Agent: Have [DATE-21]. can be a really beneficial functionality to share that information. Let's take a look at the secondary portion of this reporting of the report side here. Again, we're talking just out of the box functionality.
Agent: The other thing that's included is our BI tool built for marketers called B2B [ORG-24]. This is built on top of [ORG-23], so very flexible, but again, designed for marketers.
Agent: So we have five... out of the box dashboards ready to go Account based marketing, engagement, Marketing manager multi-touch attribution, and overall [PRODUCT-1] This is so helpful because again you can absolutely come i n and create a fully customized dashboard if you want You can even make adjustments to the existing dashboard s that I'm showing here [DATE-4] But we really wanted to focus on some of those key metric s that we know really are important for both marketer s for that sales Marketing alignmen t and for the organization organization as a whole.
Agent: So that's why we really have these five out of the b ox dashboards included and ready to [PERSON-24] This Marketing manager dashboard, great place to kind of start.
Agent: And I always like to sort of show the lay of the land here. We have our [ORG-36] health here.
Agent: And then we have an engagement health sort of information where we're looking at things like email engagement, form engagement, landing page engagement.
Agent: With this [ORG-36] health, you can see we have a breakdown of the [PRODUCT-1] that we've generated from marketing, including things like opportunity numbers, [PRODUCT-1] itself, Revenue conversion to clothes.
Agent: And we can even see that breakdown by different campaigns as well . here in the analytics side is dynamic though .
Agent: I've clicked on this trade show campaign and it automatically updates for me to show how many opportunities we've generated specifically from our trade show .
Agent: Much Pipeline we got from that trade show, how much Revenue we got from the trade show, how long it takes for those opportunities to close .
Agent: Can even come in and see, hey, we have two closed one opportunities, but we still have six potential opportunities in that prospecting stage, not even considered an open opportunity ye t. Let's make sure that maybe we're running a couple extra pieces of Content for those individuals who are still in that prospecting stage to help the sales team move things alon g. These dashboards are shareable.
Agent: So whether or not you're on the Marketing side or not, this is data that you can make accessible to your team, whether it's giving someone access, sharing it via chatter, or just downloading this information, even going into something like present mode.
Agent: So if you're in a conversation, you can pull this up and still have that dynamic way of viewing this while you're actually in a meeting as well. I'll pause here.
Agent: We'll take a look at some of the other dashboards too, but really want to make sure that you're in a meeting.
Agent: Make sure that we're focusing on how easy it is to really get these metrics out of the box because again, it's include d possible because we're built on top of the lightning platform.
Agent: So we have that access to everything that's happening from the sales [PERSON-9] e and still gives you a lot of flexibility and understanding what's working and what's not working.
Agent: So any initial questions here ?
Speaker 6: I guess my one question would be how configurable is this?
Speaker 6: You know, obviously everyone has a slightly You know, everyone, everyone's, you know, different meanings to a couple different things.
Agent: Different sales process.
Speaker 6: So how configurable is this dashboard out just a
Agent: Of the box and question on that piece. Great question. Very customizable right out of the box.
Agent: So for example, a common one is in this [PRODUCT-1] view, I have some opportunity stages like close loss, close one, discovery, a proposal, prospecting, qualification. You might have different stages. You might have more.
Agent: You might have less that you're tracking. You can absolutely make those adjustments. That's something, again, [PERSON-3] and his team can either do during that Implementation side of things.
Agent: But one thing as well, you can absolutely come in and make adjustments to these dashboards. at any point, you can add different data sets , different filters .
Agent: Very easy in your busines s and you're in your business .
Agent: To make sure that you're
Agent: Happening in your [ORG-3] org ?
Agent: Cool. And just, yeah, this is [ORG-37] tweaked for Marketing lens.
Agent: Tool that's just been
Agent: But what this does is pull real-time data across your entire salesforce org and it's the same sort of flexibility.
Agent: It's an incredible amount of flexibility where, you know, without diving really into a very technical demonstration of how exactly how you make all those changes.
Agent: It's very, very customizable to the exact type of metrics and KPIs and relevant information that your business is tracking as against what's available within your [PRODUCT-2] and how you want that to display against Marketing activities.
EndUser: Cool. Yeah. [PERSON-6], I'm sorry, [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Did you have something?
EndUser: Yeah, I just wanted to ask how, you know,
Speaker 6: What does this house is compared to what you're using in [ORG-14] and what's the difference of the key dashboard metrics that you're using [DATE-4]?
Speaker 6: So, [ORG-14], we typically don't use dashboards out we are exporting data and using a sheet to put the data together with [ORG-3] data.
EndUser: Of Marketo. If anything,
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: So it's very much separate and or is not used much, right?
Speaker 6: It's used in specific analysis, but it's not used holistically, right?
Speaker 6: And so that is a key driver of this is, we want more real time.
Speaker 6: Analytics across the organization in general, but this is really where this is driving us, is trying t o make sure that we're making, you know, we're making, we have the data that we can make decisions o n quickly, and we're taking a holistic view.
Speaker 6: We tend to do most of our reporting just in [ORG-3], and s o bringing along that Marketing reporting into view o f potential things that we're potentially
EndUser: [ORG-3] is going to get us a greater missing currently .
EndUser: Understood. For sure. So a couple of questions to buy in on this one. One somebody mentioned, I think it was either partial or multiple education. So I'd like to understand how you're doing that. And that's the second question.
Agent: Is it their ability for us to add send them out and then track through to an ROI figure based off what is actually closing?
Agent: Yes, so we can talk about the multi-touch attribution dashboard right now.
EndUser: And then I think you said that the second question was around sort of sends, is that correct and adding that into attribution?
EndUser: Yeah, if we can add, you know, manually adding. salary, you know, some form of salary allocation, and then programs
Agent: Spend to different campaigns or different things so that then we can track ROI. Again, I just think it is one less calculation that we have to do manually if we can. [PERCENT-1].
Agent: So, [PERSON-4], no, you can't see sort of what's going on, but when you create sort of the campaign itself, you can put in there the actual cost of the campaign.
Agent: And then it will automatically start to track as opportunities close, the ROI from that, but for the multi-touch attribution side, so we can absolutely kind of take that manual effort out of calculating it.
Agent: When it comes to multi-touch attribution specifically, we offer that out of the box.
Agent: The way that this works is that we are looking at the contact role on an opportunity and seeing what Marketing campaigns that contac t interacted with .
Agent: We can really understand a variety of different ways that a contact moved through an opportunit y and what caused them to actually close . offer different influence models out of the box as well .
Agent: You'll have included even distribution, first touch and a last touch model as [PERSON-23] l as you can absolutely create your own custom influence models too.
Agent: On the screen, you'll see that I can drill from specific campaigns to the account leve l, to the opportunity level, all the way down to a specific contact.
Agent: So if you close a large opportuni ty and I want to see exactly what that journey looked like, I can absolutely just drill into th at specifically.
Agent: But I can also sort of see the breakdown of my different channels too.
Agent: So I hav e, in this case, things like my Google AdWords, I can see my partner webina r, but maybe I just want to [PERSON-36] how all of my events performed. I can click on my event marketing.
Agent: It will show me a [ORG-25] own of the events that I've run [DATE-2], my customer conference, a partner webinar, a trade sh ow, an event, etc. So really easy and flexible.
Agent: And it will, you'll see as well that it automatica lly will calculate the ROI, the cost of your campaigns, the total value that you've generated, and the actual revenue. And again, this is all going to be dynamic.
Agent: So if I look at it from
Speaker 6: An e ven distribution [PERSON-37] on. versus a first touch model, really flexible, really e asy. So I know what's working and what's not work ing.
Speaker 6: So [PERSON-4], just to kind of put it in perspective, it's basically like when you ask me to do this, I'm able to do it through like a series of five or six reports.
Speaker 6: It narrows it down to a module, and we can just look at it on an ongoing basis or as needed basis and kind of parse it out as needed.
Speaker 6: So it enables us to be a lot, you know, and it enables us to have other models.
Speaker 6: Right now, we're just a [ORG-24] model and you know, you know, as we continue to scale, that might not be the best model for us And I think we're starting to see that breakdown with.. .
EndUser: Some of our newer campaigns. So. Yeah, yeah. So that's the point, [PERSON-6]. I'm not thinking even. Even not so much now. I know we can manually get around it. But we need in the future.
EndUser: So what about what I'm talking about multi at the campaign level.
Agent: Touch?
Agent: I don't even mean just
EndUser: We have accounts where, especially as it relates to [ORG-13], we're going to have the Marketing touch. We'll have an SDR touch. We'll have an AD touch. They're pretty good about logging it.
EndUser: The interactions in [ORG-3], the FDRs are excellent. The AEs are better than average. So can we begin to assess any type of partial
Agent: Attribution to the FDRs and the [NORP-3] as well?
Agent: Or is it only going to be multi-touch attribution at the campaign level?
Agent: That is a good question. Yeah, that's a great question. So this multi-touch attribution dashboard, the out of the box way is looking at the Marketing data.
Agent: However, let me show you this [ORG-13] dashboard because that's really where we have that Marketing sales alignment. What this dashboard shows is again, kind of what you're talking about on that account level.
Agent: You might already know some of your key accounts. So you can even have this dashboard just show those key accounts. Or in this case, we're pulling in every account that lives within our demo org.
Agent: So that, again, is something that [PERSON-3] and I. this team can help adjust This dashboard here for an [ORG-13] approac h is solely focused on [PERSON-25] that sales and Marketing alignment So I can see simple things like hey, the [PRODUCT-1] value for all of our key accounts open opportunities, but perhaps more importantly too I can see how sales is [PERSON-24] with these key accounts too So in addition to understanding that [PERSON-36] e of things like, hey, [PERSON-7]'s at [ORG-3] he attended our webinar Now I can also come in and speak .
Agent: [PERSON-7]'s at [PERSON-34] attended our webinar, but we also had myself [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-33] in our demo or rea ch out to [PERSON-7] at this key account at [ORG-36] And they had a meeting with hi m. They sent him an email and had [PERSON-35] So this provides that flexibility to see what's happening behind the scenes from both th at Marketing and sales [ORG-34] And I can even dive into more specifics at the account leve l. For example, here with AIMS social, I've clicked on the scree n. the specific accou nt.
Agent: I can see the breakdown of opportunities that we've generated, both close one, close lost and open. In this case, we just have open and close one. That's great.
Agent: I can see who from the sales team is interacting and what types of activities are happening behind the scenes.
Agent: And then again, I can pull in that Marketing information from things like, what are they actually engaging with from an engagement score perspective?
Agent: So are we actually seeing them interact with marketing?
Agent: What specific Marketing activities are they engaging with?
Agent: And there's one more thing that's really [PERSON-46] l that I'll show in a second, but I wanna pause here [PERSON-6], I know you have that [ORG-13] approac h that you're currently doing and also continuing to build out [PERSON-4] know that again, it sounds lik e having that sales alignment too is important here So you absolutely could customize tha t multi-touch attribution dashboard to pull some of that in That's one of the reasons why we hav e sort of this account-based [ORG-33] also included too to have that Marketing sales alignment So you can use all these dashboards kind of together working as sort of one system as opposed to sort of being too [PERSON-37]: And the last thing I'll go ahead.
EndUser: Go ahead, [PERSON-39]. Oh, go ahead.
Agent: No, no, I was going to say, and the last thing I'll add is that [PERSON-6], you asked about the flexibility of this data being, how do you make this so that this pertains to your exact business requirements?
Agent: That is where the flexibility of [ORG-23] comes in, where if you know the data is available, if you know the data is available, which we're kind of showing this across two different out of the box dashboards, That's where you could start to work with [PERSON-3] and team to find, say, hey, this is what is actually going to be the most pertinent information, you know, across a multi-touch attribution lens and say an account-based Marketing lens and just figure out how you want to dashboard that information.
Agent: But knowing that data is available in your [PRODUCT-2] and your Marketing platform, it's kind of like if you could sort of dream that information is available to start analyzing it.
EndUser: That's absolutely right. And you all look familiar probably with [ORG-35]. And it's a really cool feature that you get with the Marketing licenses. So it's really neat.
Agent: Yes, absolutely. I want to be cognizant of time. There's one more thing I want to show you from that account level just to sort of show you this is like that [PRODUCT-1] dashboard.
Agent: So again, seeing what's happening behind the scenes before an opportunity closes, we have that engagement dashboard too, which is looking at of course engagement metrics for opens, clicks, form views, [ORG-46], etc.
Agent: But what I really want to just wrap up with is again that focus on [ORG-13] extends again to the account object itself. Here I am looking at an account.
Agent: I can see those things like what campaigns specifically [ORG-37] has interacted with.
Agent: So again, [PERSON-4], to your point on understanding how is sales interacting with this account and how is this account interacting with marketing?
Agent: We can drill into any of those key accounts and see, okay, here's what they care about based off of where they're spending their time.
Agent: Spikes and engagement for the account we can see who with the account is most engaged and I can even click on specific individuals to see what [PERSON-46] has done most recently It will adjust to show me [PERSON-46]'s view his spikes and engagement, etc Then from an Einstein perspective as well we even offer [PERSON-13] account tiering So giving every account in your database and grade A through D so that you can really make sure that your accounts are fitting those key marks We give you a - likelihood to convert within [DATE-24] So how likely is this account going to actual ly close an opportunity with u s?
Agent: So again, you can make sure you're spending ti me with the right account s. And just like with the behavior score and Lead Score previously from [PERSON-13], it gives you prediction facto rs as [PERSON-46] helpful for both you on [ORG-39] and for your sales tea m. If they're looking at those key accounts to o, they can now create reports around that tiering informatio n, understand why someone fits the [ORG-46] l. and why an account is a key account for them t oo.
Agent: [PERSON-7], I wanna pass it back over to you to make sure we have [TIME-2] for some next [ORG-46].
Agent: [PERSON-6], [PERSON-14], [PERSON-4], any final questi ons before I pass it back over to Jes se?
Agent: No, we went through a lot. So. Definitely let us know if anything else comes up, but,
Speaker 6: Uh, [PERSON-7], I'll let you kind of take it over.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-5]. Perfect. Um, I know we're going to get through this pretty quickly. We're going to probably like [TIME-3] left. Um, just to close on next steps, but.
Agent: Our goal right now, and I know the biggest challenge is bandwidth to actually do it. And that's what [PERSON-3] and team are part of this conversation for. what we're looking at and what I think we're going to propose.
Agent: If we got a second for feedback, that'd be great. But we want to have your, if we're going to move forward and we're successful in contracting.
Agent: [DATE-7] and [DATE-8] is when we would want to focus on that Integration and mapping with the objective to complete the Integration mirror the market of capabilities so that, you know, if you got to [DATE-21], the idea is like, if you didn't do anything [DATE-4], we're still at the same spot, but we're on an integrated platform.
Agent: And we're going to look at training on-boarding [ORG-50] so that the operations of what you're doing or not, you don't necessarily feel a pinch in terms of the actual automations and the way that you're operating.
Agent: Where the team would then pivot is after that is complete. That's where you'd spend [DATE-21] and [DATE-23], still within [DATE-21]. [PRODUCT-4] will look with the objective of working through optimization on reporting and measurement.
Agent: So spending the dedicated time to go through the reports, through the dashboard and customize where that needs to get so that you have, you've gone past a point where you would have been at [DATE-37].
Agent: You know, versus where you would be at [DATE-37] if you didn't make that migration. So that the system operates the way you want it to.
Agent: And then from a data and analytics perspective, you're marching forward past where you were, you know, within that same timeframe.
Agent: And then moving past that once there's a comfortability on the platform, once you're continuing to learn and grow on the platform, that's when we start focusing on like a phase two type activity, which is the [ORG-7] readiness where we can start looking at things like.
Agent: Lead score guidance with all the Einstein tooling, send time optimization, key account identification, and then the new piece that's releasing in [ORG-35] view area is [PRODUCT-5] generation.
Agent: So there's a lot of runway to grow on this, but at the same time, we're really focused on the good foundational best practices in that window between [DATE-7] licensing through to your [ORG-1] shut off so that you're very comfortable and you're out of place where it's, the tools operating the way you want to see it.
Agent: And then we're really focused on the reporting analytics past that. So I'll pause there. You know, [PERSON-3], I know you're [TIME-4] over when you got a hard stop.
Agent: But anything quickly to add on that before I pass to [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-4] for any questions.
EndUser: Uh, yeah, just really quick. I mean, I think [PERSON-7] has put together a pretty good methodology here to, you know, start with the foundation and then build it. And [PERSON-6], you said it before.
EndUser: I mean, you don't want to do some big project planned out of the gate. You just, you want to build it in steps and then you can adapt. And that, that's what I think [PERSON-7]'s outlined.
EndUser: So, um, yeah, that's the only thing I would add.
Speaker 6: Awesome. I mean, from our perspective, [PERSON-50] and I are going to sync up [DATE-24]. And, you know, we'll see it, you know, want to make sure all of his questions. I know he didn't get to see this visually.
Speaker 6: So I will, while I'll make sure he got all of his questions answered and, and yes, any other additional. I'll reach out to you, [PERSON-7], and we can, we can get those cleared up.
Speaker 6: And then we will, you know, we'll make, we'll kind of come to a decision as to where we're at for the next steps. So.
Agent: Okay, so yeah, just in terms of timelines, you know, I think no surprise with how Salesforce Fiscal Year-end works, you're on the same calendar as us.
Agent: So what we'd love to do is put some time in the calendar off the top of [DATE-23] to actually go through an investment summary and just formally look at what the Implementation plan would be and what that total cost of ownership is.
Agent: And then by [DATE-36], if we're all good to move forward, we'd go through paperwork, we're proposing [EVENT-1] [DATE-37] And again, we'd look to have you ready to move off [ORG-1] by your contract end date.
Agent: And then with the key focus moving past that on the reporting analytics course.
Speaker 6: All right, cool. I mean, that time that sounds good. If everything works out, we still need to make some calls here.
Speaker 6: So let's let me, [PERSON-4] and I will sync up [DATE-24], and we will let you guys know we're at.
Agent: Okay, do you want to throw?
EndUser: Yeah, sorry. One last thing. So if you use our firm for the implementation, we would allow you to be as hands off as possible in [DATE-7] understanding that you're still So we would structure it in that way.
Speaker 6: Kind of wrapping.
EndUser: And then a little bit more involved with going through the report requirements and stuff probably Does that sound like a in [DATE-8].
Speaker 6: Good structure?
Speaker 6: Yes. As hands-off as we can be, if we're moving forward, we need to be as hands-off as possible with this.
Speaker 6: We've got a really heavy first couple of months here, and so again, there's some necessity in this, but this is where the risk reward type thing comes in, and we have to counter and weigh all of these options.
Speaker 6: But yes, if we do move forward, we and not be as possible, but we could definitely.
Agent: Want to be as hands-off
Speaker 6: Definitely provide input, but it would need to be we would really hope that we could offload you know, most of the heavy lifting to you guys And so .
Agent: Yeah, just quickly on that, that's why we wanted to get alignment on how we're thinking about the migration [DATE-4] so that if you're like, hey, that concept's going to work for us, that's where [PERSON-3] and I are going to go back and make sure from an execution perspective, the timelines, the touch points are very clearly identified where we need your team and sort of the time commitment across that Which that's where we'd love to get to book something from [DATE-25] that we can go through here's what the total cost is of the licensing Here's the cost of a proposal and then here's how we actually see this executing We just wanted to get through [DATE-4] to say, you know We'll look for any sort of feedback on questions on the actual technical capabilities But I think just given the business objectives of doubling [ORG-50] and 4X pipeline, like we want to get you to a spa rate, you know, as quickly as we can where you feel like you're past what you would have been doing in [ORG-14] [DATE-2] and knowing that the results and the expectations are increased [DATE-2].
Speaker 6: Span of that project.
Agent: So that's really what we're trying to work towards and make sure that the plan is very well, that's the focus.
Speaker 6: Seamless. So,
Agent: Just while we're on, do we want to then put something in for [DATE-24] and if something does change between now and then, you know, I'll expect.
Agent: Please feel free to listen or email, but at least we have some time locked
Speaker 6: In for [DATE-23]. Yeah, anytime in the [DATE-24] [TIME-5], I'm free.
Agent: So
EndUser: I'm good, I'm I appreciate everyone's time.
Agent: Going to go, so
EndUser: Sorry, thank you, [PERSON-6].
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-35]Agent: [PERSON-37], do you want to be on this as well on [DATE-24]?
EndUser: Go ahead and add me, and then if I need to be on, I'll
Speaker 6: Accept.
Agent: Go. Okay, sounds good. So [PERSON-6], like [TIME-6] on works for me.
Speaker 6: [DATE-25] that work for you. That
Agent: Okay, perfect. Cool. Awesome. I appreciate everyone's time. [PERSON-6], thank you for setting us up with the team and working closely with us here and [PERSON-4], it was great to meet you.
Agent: Really fun and hopefully we'll get to meet in person somehow in the not-so-distant future.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, sounds great. I'll be able to be on camera once. I couldn't update my permissions yeah, sort of the G Suite environment.
Agent: While I was driving. So, I know, sort of the [ORG-6],
EndUser: No, no, that fell on me. I was supposed to be a, I had to go cover a different meeting. So that was all
Agent: Very unexpected. That's all right. I guess just be not like if there's outside of the bandwidth pieces.
Agent: There are any other reason why you know Why your team wouldn't move forward?
EndUser: So from my perspective look Just if we have a reporting issue I think both [PERSON-6] and I are used to having a Marketing operations person who can take this off of our plate And right now mark ops yeah, I think you all can solve a reporting issue Which is I'm getting a tremendous amount of to be better on my reporting.
Agent: Is [PERSON-6]. So
EndUser: Pressure I think from that perspective, it's helpful.
EndUser: What we have to make sure, two things that are going to be vital, is one on the day-to-day operations that this is going to work for [PERSON-6] and the team, for [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-14].
EndUser: So really the decision making here is going to come down to [PERSON-6] and I'm just a sponsor. So that's going to be one thing. And then two, you've hit upon it here.
EndUser: We can't have anything that's going to bog us down. Again, just it sounds like you've got the background. We are a field force ventured backed company. We're an [ORG-37]. We are going into a fundraising cycle.
EndUser: I cannot put [PRODUCT-1] at risk going into a fundraising cycle. I cannot stress enough that if we have any whiff of danger on that front. It'll be the end of it, even if we all want to do it.
EndUser: It's just that simple. And the timing is, it's just that important to us. We had a rough [DATE-36]. We had a very good Q3 and Q4. We just need to make sure that trend continues.
EndUser: And we can't have a migration be the reason why it did not.
Agent: Again, that's just Yeah.
EndUser: Full cards on the table, just so you know where
Speaker 6: We're coming from.
Agent: No, that's fully transparent. And again, I chatted. I had a good conversation with [PERSON-1] just before [DATE-34]. Um, and that sort of lined up in terms of where the pressure is and what the expectations are.
Agent: And, um, that also is why we brought the abstract team in.
Agent: I think that's where [PERSON-6] and I just conversation was originally of like, how do we offload some of that knowing that the goal here is to get you passed what you're currently doing right now because the exercise [DATE-2] is to get past what you did [DATE-1].
Agent: So message received in terms of expectations and where there can't be a gap on the execution rope app. Migration can't be reasoned this holds this up.
Agent: That's, you know, [PERSON-3] and I are going to work in and make sure that is very clear on what and, you know, would get done. [PERSON-6] just said a curiosity just to confirm what's the exact
Speaker 6: Date of your market renewal.
Agent: Good. You're asking the tough That's the top questions.
Speaker 6: Question [DATE-4], man. Hold on, I'm gonna Let me see if I can find a market over new all I think it's [DATE-33] Yeah,
Agent: [DATE-35] Sorry, I was on mute. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay, I thought that's what I had there.
Agent: But yeah, let me, [PERSON-3] and I, we worked with the rest of [DATE-46] to make sure that it's very clear.
Agent: And I think the other thing, [PERSON-4], is, you know, transparently, I know exactly what your [ORG-1] contract is from an investment perspective. And from a [ORG-3] perspective, we'd obviously rather move you to our platform.
Agent: So knowing what your total cost is, we're gonna focus as much of that budget into the Implementation partner and that team so that. You're moving off. It's the best time to buy.
Agent: We're going to make sure that the licensing is forecasting and saving [DATE-37].
Agent: But we want to make sure from a stand up and Implementation perspective, like you're well appointed there, and you have the right investment to make sure that it's hands off.
EndUser: And you're seeing the time to value at the end of this that you're past what you're doing [DATE-4]. All
Speaker 6: Right.
Agent: I appreciate that.
Speaker 6: You're speaking my language.
EndUser: Perfect. Awesome.
Agent: Well, yeah, I appreciate [ORG-3], but that's That's, that's funny.
EndUser: It. I don't think they learned my language from
EndUser: All.
Agent: Oh
Speaker 6: Man. Nice. Yeah.
Agent: We'll be walking back on [DATE-24]. And then you, [PERSON-6].
Speaker 6: We'll go from there.
EndUser: Well, thank time, [PERSON-50].
Agent: Appreciate the

However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have provided more specific examples or success stories to illustrate the value of their product. For instance, when discussing the implementation timeline, the sales rep could have shared a success story of a similar customer who was able to complete the implementation within the proposed timeline. Additionally, when discussing the technical requirements, the sales rep could have provided more specific examples of how their product can handle marketing data and operationalize the customer journey.

video_19770_167_6qr3y000000oiDlAAI,"Agent: Okay,
Agent: So, earlier we discussed already a little bit the use case that we have focused on in the company orders.
Agent: Basically what we see as the old objectives [DATE-1] and how we will spend our time is first to talk through through. high-level the capabilities of all the management to give you an introduction to this general solution.
Agent: And that will cost about 5 to 10 minutes. And then the majority of the time we were spent on the demonstration of all the management and how that will address your intercompany or the use case.
Agent: So we already saw your feedback in regards to the personas. We incorporated that into the demo.
Agent: So, I'm asking you to hold on a little bit with the questions within the introduction, because it is just basically setting the foundation for and explaining what the solution can do and what it can to do, which is also very important to understand from where are the boundaries of all the management.
Agent: And I think seeing is believing, So when [PERSON-1] is taking over, we will focus on the order capturing use case for a video in the companies and basically show from how you can manage those particular orders.
Agent: If there are any questions, feel free to interrupt. Let it be very interactive. We have knowledgeable people on the call, so we can directly dive into the solution.
Agent: But starting with the introduction of [ORG-1], it is a solution that has been introduced since [DATE-2]. So it is relatively young within [ORG-2].
Agent: And the basic objective behind the Salesforce Order Management solution is to bring order management processes to the front office.
Agent: Meaning that employees and your customers access to order data, visibility on those particular orders, and basically have the flexibility to see the order from the moment when it's captured to the point that it will be fulfilled and track that order end-to-end on the single platform.
Agent: So when we have introduced [ORG-1], it is built with philosophy. to be channel independent but also use case independent. So meaning that we first focus on the introduction of BTC capabilities.
Agent: When we set that in majority we have stepped into the B2B market and tailored to the B2B capabilities.
Agent: So meaning that we can offer one order management solution for BTC, B2B and also direct to consumer if that is that loss of fuel. of the work of video.
Agent: It is natively built on the [ORG-3] core platform, meaning it is using the standard order summary object within the [ORG-3] platform.
Agent: And what we have introduced together with that is that we have introduced standard components, meaning we have already built the UI, we already have built routing flows, it's coming, which is basically the orchestration tool.
Agent: For distributed order management on the platform and focusing again on the declarative way of or introducing order management within the organization because no organization is the same.
Agent: They're all different requirements that offer you basically a lot of standard capabilities which can be easily extended and tailored to your particular [DATE-3].
Agent: What we also see is that from all the management perspective, we always need to integrate with existing IT landscape. So think about your [ORG-4] thinking about a [PRODUCT-1] system, a warehouse management system.
Agent: So the solution is basically built on the API first approach. meaning that we can easily integrate, but also leverage [NORP-1] for example, for leveraging your existing Integration towards the [ORG-4].
Agent: Basically, it has been designed to give an only channel order experience from the moment where you are capturing order via any channel, where you want to follow it, via any other channel at the moment of convenience for the end customers, but also the employees.
Agent: And therefore, because we have those standard capabilities, we have a fast time to market. So the average on deployment time for order management is across three two four, [DATE-4] from a contractor, a signature.
Agent: When we have introduced order management, we nowadays already have 478 plus customers using [ORG-3] order management on the platform on a global scale. And [PERCENT-1] of that is focused around B2B use cases.
Agent: Because we first focus on B2C and later added B2B capabilities, we currently see that [PERCENT-2] of the new customers on [DATE-5] is B2B related.
Agent: Meaning that we are rapidly growing into the B2B as well for order management. And I will also close up it in the [DATE-6] to order use case later on.
Agent: When we are talking about sales of order management, there are three key pillars.
Agent: You are focusing probably around order support capabilities, but I believe also that the orchestration and fulfillment and omichannel inherent in the end can be very relevant for your organization.
Agent: When we are talking about only channel inventory, it's basically that we are collecting the inventory data from the applications where you currently have stored it.
Agent: Be imported into [ORG-3] and basically can expose inventory data in any channel value needed.
Agent: Think about stock availability, maybe availability to promise a component which you want to introduce in your B2B store front so that also the companies that are ordering and knowing when they particularly can receive particular parts.
Agent: They basically give feasibility from what is the delivery time behind the skill. If you are talking at the right side about the orchestration and fulfillment part, that is also a link to intercompany or order processing.
Agent: They'll be basically talking about order routing, order routing across the different divisions or [ORG-5].
Agent: And they give feasibility from K, where is that particular order in their fulfillment status, once it's collected at a one-feed-the-el-business unit, and it's collected at a central organization, and will be sent out to the end customer, tracking that end-to-end status of that particular order, that is the power behind the sales solution.
Agent: And then in the middle, we have which we call the so-called order support.
Agent: Basically give you as an organization full visibility on tracking that particular orders, but also give your employees visibility and authorization to make adjustments to those particular orders, to cancel a particular item on the order that also many social returns or even order on behalf of your customer.
Agent: From one single console, this is the [ORG-3] platform. And if you're using [PRODUCT-2], then that will be the console where you also will manage your particular orders.
Agent: In addition, order support is also related to your end customers. So basically focusing on physical, self-serve capabilities. So meaning that your customers can already order, fire the B2B or commercial front.
Agent: But now they also can see those orders and also make online changes to open those particular orders if you want to do that. So leveraging those capabilities for your employees but also for your end-to-end customers.
Agent: And therefore, we see that order management is embedded in every process around the clouds that self-forces providing. So, meaning that we give visibility to account executive what the particular order status is.
Agent: That you also have visibility from what the fulfillment status of those particular order is. There it is currently in fulfillment at this particular business unit.
Agent: But also because it rolls up to that order summary, we also know if the customer has paid the invoice, for example, for fulfillment order. So giving that full transparency to your employees.
Agent: Because it is stored on one single platform, we can also identify where those particular orders come coming from.
Agent: So one site, they can come in for the B2B storefront, and the other site, they can come in for [ORG-6], for example. And maybe there are other ordering channels where you capture in particular order.
Agent: You have full feasibility from where that particular order is captured and how that will be fulfilled. If there is any question or need support on a particular orders, your employees have that full feasibility within the Service Cloud console.
Agent: And because it's also stored on one particular platform, [ORG-7] cloud, for example, is very important so that you can proactively inform your customers, like a state, which is of the fulfillment of the particular orders.
Agent: So if there is any delay in a process, you can proactively inform your customers about that particular delay and what the new potential delivery time is going to be.
Agent: Oh, going back. And this is how we could basically an example from [PERSON-2]. and generate customer architecture where we are understanding that [ORG-3] order management is in the middle of any IT or organization.
Agent: There can be different technologies in the front end or think about the mobile application for example where the capture order goes through the [ORG-3] platform.
Agent: As you have heard all the summary information, capturing the payment is also very important.
Agent: So maybe you have the Integration with the payment provider going through the platform, or maybe you have even your own billing system that is a particular Integration that we foresee with the platform as well.
Agent: The backend integrations are more focusing around the warehouse, 3PL, [ORG-4], but also shipping providers. So getting that full feasibility on your platform so that you have a good status from where the particular order is.
Agent: Who is potentially shipping it and where it is currently is for the delivery. An example, customer example, I think [PERSON-3] and Pay Call is in a very good example. They are basically made to order for kitchen.
Agent: So every kitchen for [ORG-8] is custom.
Agent: And they are working on a global scale, meaning that in every country they have an organization on [ORG-9] and particular parts of those kitchens can be also exchanged within the different countries.
Agent: So when a customer is going online, configure that particular kitchen, that order is captured and then global is going to be filled from how can we quickly.
Agent: Fill this particular kitchen towards the customer, meaning that spare parts are coming from different pieces units to make that complete kitchen available and ready for the delivery.
Agent: Because they are doing that on one single platform, you see the efficiency from a sales service perspective, but also the service perspective.
Agent: Because what you typically see with the kitchen is that one side, it is a [ORG-10] customer that is warning in particular a kitchen, but want to make changes later on in that particular process.
Agent: So full visibility is important for the organization to see from where is that kitchen in the Manufacturing process. It can allow particular changes to those particular elements of the kitchens.
Agent: But also it is the branches that they are working with that are producing particular components for those kitchens so that he can clearly instruct those when those particular parts of that kitchen needs to be arrived in a central location for [PERSON-3] and Pay Call so that he can construct the whole kitchen together.
Agent: So that interaction with the third party vendors for particular parts is also very important for them to manage. And they work straight at one single single platform. So in this regard, I want to open up quickly questions before
EndUser: We are going to step into the demo and beforehand, you know, to be. Yeah, one question already. Yeah. You mentioned a feature, but how When you only have, let's say, your stock levels available.
Agent: Are you going to do that?
Agent: And how do you see that in a, let's say, made to order a context?
Agent: Yeah, so I think for a made to order, it is already a little bit complex, or at least for some skills you know. the amount of the certain period of production.
Agent: So meaning that if you have, and I think to try to think in your use case.
Agent: So if you have the wheels from a car example, you know that in general the live production time is about 3-4 weeks for example.
EndUser: You know, it's kind of a bit interesting, what kind of functionalities do you have for [ORG-10] check in sales force?
EndUser: That's maybe a better question.
EndUser: Do you have something available for that?
Agent: So it is more about collecting all the data and that you have to fit in way to expose that into an ordering channel.
EndUser: Yeah, so it's because [ORG-10], but it is more or less gathering all the information. Okay, correct. So in an econ perspective, uh, show.
Agent: Okay. Check. [PERSON-4], Another one.
EndUser: Can you take over?
EndUser: So you mentioned also in [ORG-14], you are able to change orders and all that kind of stuff on the so customer raised [DATE-7] in econ and back office employee is able to make changes on behalf of the customer or whatever.
EndUser: Is that only with all mass rollers that also out the box B2B commerce functionality?
Agent: So what you are having with an out of the box B2B is which we call you are already using the standard order summary. With currently it is, which we call an unmanaged order.
Agent: So you can't allow any changes to that particular order. With order management, we change that unmanaged order to a managed order, meaning that you can make any changes to those particular orders. So it changes with order management solution.
EndUser: Okay and not a question then.
Agent: How was the license wise?
Agent: That's maybe done a question for all of yourself. So license wise if you are looking to the license model of order management, is again price per order.
EndUser: It
Agent: So similar like the BTV part. And there are two ways of orders, maybe say from okay.
Agent: We have the unmanaged orders, so say for example, if your [ORG-4] instance, there are 82,000 orders and you want to import them for order, which we call order feasibility.
EndUser: In there,
Agent: So that at least the customer knows what in the past has been ordered. Then it comes with a particular bundle. So there is a ratio with our license model. is that managed order, you're getting three unmanaged orders.
EndUser: For every
Agent: So if you're doing that in on a large bucket, you can import a lot of historical orders, which are untouched. If you want to make any changes to those particular orders, we see that as a managed order, which
EndUser: Is the beta HQ, the debate license. But it's either, say if you have a B2B commerce order and it
Agent: Runs into OMS, it's an OMS order and it's not a B2B commerce order. Then, if you want to say that. So via [ORG-14].
EndUser: It is captured
Agent: So we count that particular order on [ORG-14] And when you want to have it in order management, so
EndUser: If you're making decision for order management, so you're paying on two levels, so B2B
Agent: And order management. Okay.
Agent: And that's clear. Yeah, with the base yeah, if you would like to go in that deeper, then we can discuss pricing, of course.
EndUser: Price, but this is something,
Agent: I can already say that the pricing for, or the management orders, is much lower than B2B-commerce order. Since you already have users, so there are no additional users required also.
Agent: So it's just focusing on an order volume for auto management.
EndUser: Okay. Okay.
Agent: Okay. [PERSON-1],
Agent: Go ahead. Yep.
EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: So I'm sharing my screen. Can you first confirm that
EndUser: If you can see my screen now?
Agent: Okay, great. So now, so first of all, I want to introduce, say, you will meet three different people in our demo journey. So first of all, you may meet [PERSON-5], who will be our customer.
Agent: So [PERSON-5] will be placing the order from the storefront. And then, as [PERSON-5] can get the real-time order tracking because of order management. So we can provide this information.
Agent: And they say, reach can easily do self-service on the orders. And then reach can easily get an estimated time of the delivery.
Agent: But that will be worth a slightly custom solution on order management because, so for the estimated delivery so that we do need some other information, then we do need to calculate that. And it's a for different business.
Agent: So for example, for your case, you may have a different way to calculate that. especially for your, you may have some intercompany transfer and then, um, as you say, you may have a different process for that.
Agent: Say, I will show you that what we have. So how, oh, an example is how to calculate that or, um, an example called auto management can provide those information to the software.
Agent: And then you will meet [ORG-18], so he will be the operation manager. So he will be the one that's debuting the order management, but actually was [ORG-3] order manager.
Agent: And you may see that his role will be a little bit virtual because everything order management were trying to make that automated. So you won't see that he's managing that.
Agent: So he can just be viewing that every make sure that everything's working well. So he can view the report and dashboard and he can see that the order fulfillment especially so he can see the orders plating.
Agent: And then as you say that's it because it was order management so we can find the exception so on early stage and then we can raise that to our to all app or to the relative team so that they can handle those exceptions as well.
Agent: And then you want me to team who is our customer service agent. And then for him, so that he will get a degree view of the customer.
Agent: And then he also can get the full visibility of the order summary. And he can easily see the order history of this customer.
Agent: And then he will easily have the order service actions to assist with the order related Hope that's clear for you.
EndUser: The customer queries.
Agent: And then do you have any questions?
Agent: No, it's clear. OK. So now, so here will be the story I'm going to explain in the demo. So first, so that [PERSON-5] will place an order from the storefront.
Agent: And then say for [PERSON-6], say that's when he goes to the order will be synced to order management. And then for [PERSON-6], say that I can show you the report and dashboard.
Agent: So that's where he can see the important KPI. So how many open orders or how many orders are already in fulfillment and so on.
Agent: And then we'll see that the order will be auto allocated and which means it will be auto-suleted into different performance as well.
Agent: And here I want to show you the exam pay say for intercompany transfer, say for one form of order, so that will b e corporate by both company A and company B.
Agent: So company A will finish his part of the sophomore order and then transfer that to company B to complete the sophomore order.
Agent: And then the order we have speed that way, we do have another sophomore order which is allocated to company C to fulfill that. And then, so once that all completes, say the order will be delivered to the customer.
Agent: And then at the same time, so reach home and have a question.
Agent: So where is my question?
Agent: So reach home and have a question that where is my order now so she can raise that from the storefronts, chat.
Agent: And we do have a bot which can support what's the self-service for her to tracking where his where is her order.
Agent: And Ase, if she's unhappy with anything that she received from that order, she can [PERSON-7] talk to an agent, so using the [ORG-18] agent. And then team here will be jump in and then support [PERSON-8].
Agent: For any of her order related queries. But here, so that we will use return as an example. So I hope this
EndUser: Journey is all clear for you. Or do you have any
Agent: Queries or anything that you want to see, but we're not showing here.
Agent: I think there's a little bit, right?
Agent: No questions. Okay, great. Cool. So now let's start our journey. So here's so that I'm learning as a BTV storefront, say, a very prepared car so that we can do checkouts.
Agent: So here I just want to quickly complete the checkouts. So there are a few checkouts steps to calculate the shipping, the inventory, tax and so on.
Agent: And then here I'm using a purchase order.
Agent: And then you will see that's it after [TIME-1]. So the order has been placed. And then say, as the order has been placed, you will see that.
Agent: So I'm going to now landing on the order management counseling on [ORG-3] platform. So you may be familiar with that. So if you're using [PRODUCT-3] already, so it's exactly the same view.
Agent: So here I'm landing at a list to view. If I refresh the list,
Agent: And then you will see that a new order is coming in. So there's a new order so that it just placed and then it's coming right immediately.
Agent: And then I was also talking about that, say, as [ORG-18], say he can view some report on dashboard.
Agent: So we do provide a sample homepage and then we're just showing you that, say, some report on dashboard on the page. for example, the process exception.
Agent: So if there anything goes wrong, while the order is orchestrating, and then say if anything goes wrong, so you can see that from here, from this report.
Agent: And then because in this demo, I don't have enough information to share. So, since it's a task arc, I can show you later in a different arc. So you'll see that there's some more data.
Agent: And then you can see that there are some open orders. And then if there's any return happens, and then they would also have a return chance or return reasons. But of course, it's not only for returns.
Agent: You can put that say on any order related quantification, for example, cancellation.
Agent: Or if you provide any additional discount to the customer for different reasons, you can capture that reason and then you can show you on the dashboard here.
Agent: So now let's go back to our order and then I've already explained so that you can see here. And then on this list, so it's not only showing, it's not showing on this org, but let me see.
Agent: Yeah, so I can show you later on a different org. So you will see that in that one. So we do provide so the orders are coming from different sales channels.
Agent: So here I do have on this org, I only have the [ORG-14] But on the other org, see we'll see.
Agent: See that an order can come in from BTC, B2B, [ORG-19], marketplace, so any different sale s channels or EDI orders, so you can import all your orders from different sales channel s into order management and then you will have centralized place to manage all your orders .
Agent: Say now let's go and see the order details. So first of all, I want to introduce an object called order summary. So that is a new object coming was order management.
Agent: So from the name, you can see that it's summarized all the order details and a single change that has been applied to those order.
Agent: So that change can cover for the status change or the performance status change, but a so that that change can cover like any order modification, like if there's any consolation. happen to this order.
Agent: If there's any return happens, so anything happens on this order . can find the details from this order summary object . And here you will see that we have some highlighted information about this order.
Agent: So you will see that who is customer places order when the order is placed.
Agent: What's current order status?
Agent: So waiting to fulfill main service order has been allocated. And they say the different companies or different warehouse are working to prepare those order. And we also have the billing address and the sales channels.
Agent: Therefore, this one is [ORG-14] And on the other, you will see that different sales channels as well. And then you have some detailed information about the product, the shipping address. So, and also [ORG-19].
Agent: So because those orgs already, the order allocated for the products, so you can see that here, [ORG-19], Chief For Form Orders generated.
Agent: And the first For Form Order is initially allocated at [ORG-25], the other is allocated [ORG-18] to complete the order. And on the other side, we have an order, total breakdown.
Agent: So you can see that say, if there's any discount applied, you can see that information here as well. So was the shipping was the tax there. And here, so that will be the important part for the service agent.
Agent: You can see that's are the some order service actions, which so you can use that to support the customer for canceling those items.
Agent: To provide further discount to the products, to provide return option to those customers, or if there's anything that's missing or broken during the transit, you can also create a reship order for those customers as well.
Agent: And here's just some examples where [ORG-25] provide other options like exchange.
Agent: So for example, if cost would make an order but they want to change the color or the amount to change the size, they can use the exchange order. to exchange the item they want to choose as well.
Agent: And where you say have the option to allow customers to add more items to this order.
Agent: Say you can configure some grace periods and then say during that period, so if customers feel like, yeah, I ordered five, but I want to order more, five more, so they can change, they can add five more items to this order as well.
Agent: So they no longer need to place a new order, so they can just use this one.
Agent: And then on the other side, you will see we also provide some quick links because we all know that order is not only orders, order related information.
Agent: So here's a we share some products, performance, shipping information, but you may either have shipment records. You may also want to have the invoice information credit memo information.
Agent: Or if there's an exception happens or AC because we can link with service cloud. So if there's any case has been raised related to this order, you can put all the order related information and sharing on this page.
Agent: So, as all of the operation manager or whoever needs to know anything happens on this order, they can just go to this one single page and they will have all the information about those orders.
Agent: Do you have any questions so
EndUser: Far for anything unclear?
EndUser: I think this is clear. All right, this is...
EndUser: Later on I would like to know how this is being done, but because... but I think that's coming into detail. Let's first take the happy flow and look at the good old viewers who prepared it.
Agent: Yeah, sure. Sorry, one
EndUser: Question.
EndUser: So if you look at this from a happy flow perspective, how does this match with the [ORG-25] scenario you have in mind?
EndUser: Well, this covers part of the scenario, but directly, currently I can do this also. We've created this also in a book without auto management. So I don't need auto management for this.
EndUser: So, that would be my, this is just the flow creating fulfillment order and a, and a, and a based on the specific condition, right?
EndUser: So, this is not, yeah, I don't want to be on the negative side on this, but this is nice, but this is not, this is not what, nothing that flow can do for me.
EndUser: You would like to understand better what order management is.
EndUser: Right, so I'm not saying anything strange, right?
EndUser: This is nice, this is good. But this is, I have the same, this is in my demo walk, without ornamentment, which is the record, it flows a checks decision and then creates a
Agent: On a fulfillment one or two fulfillment.
Agent: Okay. Let us see them. Yeah. So now I will move to the fulfillment order. Say the first one two share is the one say that was intercompany transfer. Say for this one.
Agent: The FofoM order will be the information we're going to share with [ORG-29] or your child company, for example, company A, whoever needs to fulfill this part of order.
Agent: In the Fofom order, you can see that we do provide the necessary information that the company A or the warehouse that they need to know to prepare this order as well.
Agent: So we see that who will be the customer who is going to receive this order.
Agent: And then what's the current status?
Agent: What is the final performance shipping address?
Agent: And what is the current Fofom location?
Agent: So it can be the company as well. You know that's a belleable. is you can modify the label to a more relative [PERSON-9] e for your business .
Agent: And the creation dates, the paths to the status, and then you see you have all here, so that's which are the products in this perform order, so that's which are the products you're going to prepare.
Agent: And you can also have the shipment, say if there's any shipment, and here you will later, you will see that OSA puts the shipment for the intercompany transfer as well, so you can keep track of that part of the shipment as well.
Agent: We also have some more details about the orders, so who is the customer, which all other summaries are related to this one.
Agent: What is the delivery method the customer has been chosen, and the shipping address, and say, I'm saying, and now you say the pricing and the order title information as well.
Agent: You can of course add in more details to those formal orders that you know that's about the sales was safe. And further information you want to add into those and plan to your.
Agent: [ORG-25] management system or to the different companies you can put them all here. And then I want to show you one thing is say let's say company A has complete thus order and then so mark that in transit.
Agent: So at this internal status so to mark that say I have finished thus but the order is not finished yet. So it's not fulfilled. It's in transit.
Agent: And then I just simulate so we can integrate with company A's IT system so that they can cup-keep that update and automatically or through integration. But here I'm just using manual action to simulate that.
Agent: And now, so you can see here, after I change that to [PERSON-10]. So you can see here, the fulfillment location. It's automatically changed.
Agent: Move to the next company who is going to take over those perform orders that could company be here.
Agent: And then, as you say, I put the status, it's changed from intrinsic to weighting transients, because for company A, sorry, a company has complete that and put that in transit.
Agent: And then company B says that it's weighting the transients of those.
Agent: And then say, But you can add some more different status so that it's fully configurable, so you can configure whatever the status which is more makes sense for your business as well.
Agent: So here I just choose those as example to expand for you.
Agent: And then as I say here you will see that there is a shipment, say, that shipment can be created from company A's as long as they have the tracking information.
Agent: And how to tracking those, we can have a shipment record and we can A's have the status. So here is [PERSON-10]. So I put that as company B, so it's because it creates a new object.
Agent: So I call that performance process configuration. Of course, the name doesn't make sense for you, so you can have a different name on this one.
Agent: And so I choose that so configure that, say, which is the product and what will be the performance process play for or what will be the production play for this product.
Agent: So for that, hey I've just configured for this gearbox product. So the first step is say it will be company A and the n the next step will be company B.
Agent: So after company A complete his part, so for those products I will move to the company B for the second part. Of course, you can keep continuing adding that and then you can add more further information about this.
Agent: Here I just make that sample and then I just want to
EndUser: Show you an example how you can configure this for the inter-company transfer and how you can leverage auto management.
Agent: To track the part of the auto management standard or is this something custom that you added on top of auto management?
Agent: Thus object, object.
EndUser: It's a custom So I didn't make that say but it's very simple one so you can see that saying you can simply add this and then you can elaborate that.
Agent: Check, standard auto management or are we adding something custom too?
EndUser: Is this
Agent: Yeah, I did add some custom. And then say, so here so that we can see that say we have those in transients.
Agent: And then I can say added the shipment, and then I just update the status to deliver it. So what remains, thus part of order has been arriving to company B.
Agent: And now, I think you will see, should have... Let me refresh it.
Agent: Yeah, and then so you can see that the status on this form order is able to move to say it's from waiting transit to allocated because the order has moved to company B and that company we can start it preparing their part of this order.
Agent: And then once they complete that, we can mark that to be fulfilled and then we can move to the next.
Agent: Say here if I mark that and then you will see say the fulfillment order is marked as fulfilled and then we have another shipment record so that will be the final one and then shipping to the customer address instead of so you can see that the shipping address is a little bit different because the second one will be to the final the customer address and then the first one will be shipped to the company the address.
Agent: And then when we're back to the order, you can see that the order has been partially fulfilled. And then if I mark this one as fulfilled, say you will see then that's the whole order has been fulfilled.
Agent: It's just there's some, yeah, there's some delay on those water, but you can see the idea is that we can manage the perform order separately. And then the perform order can be intercompany transfer.
Agent: It can't, it's a so that's one single company can just to finish completes that perform order. And then we can split space on the, you can configure different rules and then just play the order.
Agent: Do you have any questions?
Agent: Say for mouse one or any comments you want to add.
EndUser: I see you thinking [PERSON-10]. Yeah, well, this is
EndUser: Not completely representing our situation because in our situation, it really isn't in the company or now this is more a company order where it has multiple shipping locations or milk that come together with within one location where we do this in more multiple there's more bit becomes on bit.
EndUser: Commercial scenario. Yeah, well, it's multiple deliverable warehouses combining together in one instance, centralized warehouse where it will be combined and then shipped. This is, of course, useful.
EndUser: But this is in effect in our situation, but yeah, of course, this is just a demo. And I think in the end, everything should be possible.
EndUser: But in our situation, when this is a order for company A, shall we say, then in the end, it will also lead to a, to a purchase company for purchase order for [ORG-18], which will [ORG-18] will have it as a normal order.
EndUser: For those to be new, they are, yeah, a sister from each other, shall say, and [ORG-18] has a normal order with fulfillment, order with a warehouse, etc., etc. fulfills the purchase order of company the scenario A.
Agent: So is slightly different.
Agent: I see that this is a... The which the fulfillment will be like a sales order for the other company.
EndUser: Means order
EndUser: So where do you capture those sales order?
EndUser: We are going to say that, yeah. Let's go to 105 autonomous companies. So if. Company A in this case, scenario, has to get the order, but needs to purchase something at another video selling company [ORG-29]: And your
EndUser: Then it makes purchase requisition for company B. That is a sales order because they are selling it to company A. And then it is delivered to either directly to the customer or it's company A.
Agent: Delivered to a
EndUser: And we also have the scenario, let's say we have company A who has the order or the contract with the district, the [ORG-28].
EndUser: And saying, okay, we are going to produce real ups and to produce real ups, we first need to, let's say, purchase a carstered real how the [LANGUAGE-1] word is, but that needs to be castered.
Agent: Things. I'm not sure
EndUser: And then we purchased a lot of other components from [ORG-29] server links, but also non-VDL companies. So a lot of purchase requisitions are being made. Some do, let's say, get on stock.
EndUser: And then the next step is to have that, for example, being painted in a certain position. And then it comes back again to [ORG-25], and then it's assigned to the final configuration that is needed.
EndUser: And then it And that's the, that's also a huge case.
Agent: Shipped to [ORG-28].
EndUser: So we have a lot of, let's say purchase requisition sales all for our company managing that status is that company in. within the time limits that we expected and that kind of stuff. Do we have some where
Agent: Issues,
EndUser: Do I bring the time with [ORG-28]?
EndUser: Those kind of scenarios, that's what we have. This is more or less indeed.
Agent: Managing multiple warehouse locations and not really in the company as we see it.
Agent: Yeah, thanks to [ORG-33] your use case is a little bit different because you're like say the company A receive a self-order from global and then company A need to analyze that. order and then see that's what's missing.
Agent: And then if I'm missing those parts, I need to place a new order to a different company, company fees.
EndUser: And then say, but to fulfill that all in time for [ORG-28], it means that the party is, let's say, ordering with company fee. need to be in time back
Agent: For them to do the production of that realer, for example. That's a secret. Line is a special line. Yeah, so it's like say company A, so I can consider A, so I can consider company
EndUser: Company B as one of my supplier and then I make an on other order on that supplier.
Agent: But immediate supertational order but the order is for company B is still the order. Yeah, so let's say for example, let's say thus order. So that's initial order. So thus order is now make for [ORG-31].
Agent: So the order is
EndUser: Make for company A. So as a company I have received thus order and then but then we don't want all of the company B is a purchase requisition yeah.
Agent: So
Agent: Company B and it's a sales oil for company B. Yeah, yeah, I've got that.
Agent: So I think that part is okay because it's just how we manage that because the sales order won't be sharing on the company A part.
Agent: So I can still consider that the performer order but then I integrate with company B and then the sales order should be created. company fees IT structure for their system.
Agent: So there is a new order coming in because that's why we are supporting the other B2B orders.
Agent: So was there suppliers?
Agent: Say for example we can do like let's say the motor. So I don't have this motor so I need to reach out to my supplier.
Agent: So let's say company C is my supplier and then I can directly allocate that and then I send the [PRODUCT-4] water to company C and then say I sent a [ORG-24] [PRODUCT-4]'s motor for me so company C is my supplier.
Agent: That's how we generally that we're working for, we're supporting our BTV customers with their suppliers. We can support that.
Agent: And then it's just to say, when the FOPM order reached the company C and thus FOPM order can be converted as a sales order on their side. And that's how it's working, so usually with a supplier.
Agent: But my question is because For splitting the order, we do need to have different order items . But my understanding is that for example, for [ORG-33], say they may just order a motor.
Agent: Say, and then you need to speed the motor to different parts. And then one piece of parts, I don't have that now.
Agent: So I need to reach out to my supplier company, be to either produce that or to do that.
Agent: But for that one, say we was order management, say, unless you do some customisation on that. Otherwise, it was a standard order management. You may need to have, for example, the small-tier product.
Agent: If you can create a boundary of this, at least in all the pieces of parts you need. And then each part will be an order items and then we can simply do that.
Agent: So for different parts, because we just consider as one single product. And then those products will be, we need to, we don't have that in stock. So let me show you this.
Agent: So I want to show you one thing is we call that Omi channel inventory.
Agent: Sorry, I just broke down the demo journey. So we will now show you something. So it was a different order than. That's one. One, make out of products.
Agent: So here is if you just consider this as a single piece of the part, say to do that. So you can see that we have this omitted inventory service that is inventory service.
Agent: So we provide for the inventory availability service. So you can plug in your warehouse inventory. You can use a plug in the supplier inventory. So here's so that you can see that we can have a supplier.
Agent: So you can have sharing that for example for this product. I don't have stock on my warehouse and I only have stock for the supplier . then in that way, so we can .
Agent: We just allocate that to the supplier and then we found that for form an order for that supplier. So we send it from an ordered company being.
Agent: And then when company being received that form an order, company being can create a sales order in their system.
EndUser: So we can pass all the information they need to create the sales order in their system. So that's the [ORG-24] issue.
Agent: And the part where you have a
EndUser: Say we product, an SKU, and there's actually a combination of these five sub products, or the beddads, you take that part. Yeah, it can be a bundle product. Yeah, that's a bundle. Or a product set, yeah. Okay.
EndUser: That's part of also, but now we're looking at That's part of the automatic or that's something different.
Agent: Only channel inventory.
EndUser: That is for the management. Yeah. Okay. And that bundling that's part of the auto management or is that part of commerce.
Agent: Where we say this queue is actually this, this,
Agent: So the SKU will be the, say, but of course, if you're using B2B [ORG-31], so we did match the same [PRODUCT-5] and also in order management.
Agent: So because when the order is placed, we check the SKU map products and then we can reach out to the [ORG-40] inventory and then find which is best place.
Agent: It's available or, and then if it's, there are multiple products, multiple locations available, so which is nearest. course.
EndUser: So you can configure different rules on the routing as well . Yeah, okay, got it. And the rules, it's just plain flow.
Agent: So if you say, if this and then the automation that's flow, or is that something else?
Agent: It can say, of course, the main part will be flow, so to do the whole routing, but you can use it at
EndUser: Some more, so for example, let me get this.
Agent: You may have noticed
EndUser: We are more or less interested in the technical side of all go better
Agent: Of them rather than we and we are looking at the scenes. Yeah, I found it. Say, you say configures on so those is a custom object as well. So.
Agent: It's just you can use, because we just provide sample flows on the routing, but that is based on shipping distance product availability. In your case, if you have some different rules, for example, you can leverage some data.
Agent: Custom objects and configure different rules. And then we can follow that as well. So for example, you can put that say, yeah, if it's B2B channel. And then, yeah, for example, that's one marketplace.
Agent: And then you can put that, which is the product. If the order contains those products, and then it can be high priority. And then you can also configure, so that's which location to fulfill those.
Agent: So you can skip that. And by all of us, we also have priority on the location level. So you can say, for example, base locations have availability and similar shipping distance in the [GPE-1]. the parity will be the
EndUser: Most important factor to decide which it's
Agent: Location to fulfill this.
Agent: So for example, this is something out of the box, is this also?
Agent: This one is custom, but the location, um, yeah, the location parity that is, um, You can see here so you can configure the parity.
Agent: So the parity is out of the
Agent: Box.
Agent: Coming back to the question mainly from the video team, what's used being behind?
Agent: So the majority of the basis rules are configured via lightning flows.
Agent: But there are other ways for doing these kind of being business, business roles.
Agent: And what we also understood from the preparation is that this is also the part that is causing a lot of internal email conversations, right?
Agent: So this is causing the communication about these orders.
Agent: This is causing internally a lot of email traffic, correct?
EndUser: The intercompany stuff, of course,
EndUser: That we are able to build something on sales force that is, let's say, making that visible. Yeah.
Agent: I don't know. That one,
EndUser: The question is what's in the box of auto management?
EndUser: Yeah, of course. What is no more or less, but we don't have to build ourselves.
EndUser: Because that's the trade-off that we need to make, because either we pay per order let's say sales force because they have a nice auto management solution.
Agent: An amount to Yeah.
EndUser: Which fits our needs and needs some customization. But if it's like, okay, we have auto management and we have still a tons of customization to do. And with everything that has changed, we still have a lot of maintenance.
EndUser: Then what's the added value of [ORG-14]?
EndUser: And that's where I'm searching for.
EndUser: So what's the added value for [ORG-14]?
Agent: For
EndUser: Vdl, you need.
EndUser: And I'm struggling to find the answer in the demo [DATE-1].
EndUser: Not that the demo is bad, but I'm really searching on how can we use this?
EndUser: Because that's our decision point, right?
EndUser: We have to decide. But we don't have to decide if we are... Or we need to manage our orders. We're far beyond that. We need to manage our orders.
EndUser: And we're at the decision point where we... are looking into, okay, are we going to do that ourselves by using custom objects flows and maybe some apex now and then red that's needed?
Agent: And creating
EndUser: Or are we going to use standard self-water management solution that out of the box gives us a lot of tools that are useful and that we can use out of the box and that helps us and stay standard because we like this taking to the standard.
Agent: To use the standard
EndUser: But yeah, that's the decision, that's the use case, the business case that we're working on actually.
EndUser: Yeah, so that's, of course, not completely answered now already. So that needs time and that needs information.
Agent: And I'm also still looking into that now. Of course, [PERSON-14], so lays in the middle, of course. In the end, your use case can be built on the platform, which you can do.
Agent: But you know also that there's a disadvantage of that. I think if you're looking to order management, it gives you an head start.
Agent: So, can it fulfill requirements out of the books?
EndUser: For [PERCENT-3] your
Agent: It probably won't do.
Agent: I think
Agent: It is. That's cool. It's about, yeah. Yeah.
Agent: So, I think it's coming back from, okay, what kind of value are you getting out of it?
Agent: So, I think, first of all, we have the data model. And I think that's maybe also that we provide the insights into the data model.
Agent: What kind of relationships and child relationships in related standards or objects?
Agent: So that is first of all giving you a head start. Also if you're knowing from the Innovation curve of [ORG-3] introducing new capabilities it will adopt those standard or objects by default.
Agent: I think in the end also looking to delete UI components is that something that you're going to build. probably not. You're going to leverage some standard components and
EndUser: Maybe you will adjust them in a certain way.
EndUser: And what are what components are you referring to because I didn't see a lot of Let's say special things that are in standard skills work, right?
Agent: You know, the UI. I think that that's the second part of [ORG-45], [ORG-31] demo. It's also explaining to the Service Cloud Console.
Agent: So, for example, you see the order search for me, or object, you can make a custom object and you have to do the visibility. But you see also at the left side earlier that there are different action buttons.
Agent: So that are UI components and you also see a return process. It's our standard UI components which comes in, comes with the solution.
Agent: If you are going to develop with it by yourself, you need to create all these components which can be done, of course. But again, this is a giving you
EndUser: A that had to start.
EndUser: This is just a visual flow, right?
Agent: Yeah, it's a screen play. You can see that we do have a few screens and then we have prepared there. Another one we have is the order on behalf of.
Agent: We do provide those options. So you can order on behalf of a customer.
Agent: Say if I Slack the store, say, um, it's the thing to be cost [DATE-7].
EndUser: So these are unmanaged flows that come in the package and you can, change two business processes.
Agent: Or we can the, up to Yes, correct.
EndUser: And we need to build it completely ourselves because we don't have the unmanaged versions.
Agent: Yeah, so for example, so you can just place a new order for this on behalf of the customer. So if they have any issues on placing an order, say your service agent can support
EndUser: A customer for this.
EndUser: This is different than
Agent: What we have in B2B [ORG-31], for example, where we're off. that you really need to go into this door. Let's say it in that way. Exactly. So this is directly ordering from the solution.
Agent: So this is for customer service. This is for sales. They can place order on behalf of the customer. They within the [PRODUCT-6], they don't need any e-commerce knowledge.
Agent: They can just order directly from the [PRODUCT-6] solution, from sales cloud, which standard components. So an additional feature here.
EndUser: That's
Agent: And. And I think also of course this is a discussion we often have with [ORG-29].
Agent: Can we build it?
Agent: It doesn't mean that you and there's not what you're saying but this is if you can build it doesn't mean that you need to build it yourself. Right so I think you have a small thing.
Agent: I think we need to be really conscious of the expertise in the time that also [PERSON-14] has. Right so [PERSON-14] is offering a lot of functionalities additional here to the solution. As a standard component you can add.
Agent: Adjust and also reuse it on the parts of the company So I also, it is not [PERCENT-3] correct business case I would also share it with you the [ORG-25] parts of business case s showing what can you do to also enable order [PERSON-18] for the [NORP-2] service department I said that they also can modify the order s and that they don't have to send email s back and forth to the Christmas those Christmas can help those [DATE-8] much faster This is also a functionality that all managemen t is bringing .
EndUser: That they can handle
Agent: And also, if you look at the trade-off, are you going to build it or are you going to buy it?
Agent: I think this is a really important trade-off. We can make this decision in all openness we can make this decision
EndUser: And together because the investment you need to make is also a really important part for that. And that's, let's say, hitting the nail
EndUser: Yeah, but that mainly depends on two things, right?
EndUser: That depends on the price and that depends on the effort. That's where we need to have a little bit more clarity on. So you need to understand and that's I think that's reason why we have this session.
Agent: Mainly the
EndUser: To understand a little bit better, I think, OMS as you showed it now, we already saw a little bit earlier. It has been involved, so that's good to see.
EndUser: But what's on the roadmap, indeed, because we also have principles within [ORG-29], so we have reuse.
EndUser: And then first of all, if we have it already, so if we have an all-room management system, we You're using that one?
Agent: First do that.
EndUser: Yeah. As far as I'm aware, we don't have one doing that across multiple companies, so... then it's buy overbuilt.
EndUser: So if we can buy it and it has more and it has a reason to buy it, you buy it.
EndUser: But let's say more or less a year back we looked at the box of auto management and then it was let's say the data model, some objects and some flows which were not really at that point.
Agent: Useful for video
EndUser: So it's now it's again making sure that we look at what's, how much is in there that we can leverage already from the product which helps us, let's say speed up.
EndUser: And so these kind of screens haven't seen before.
EndUser: So what's in there which can help us to get a value quickly for VDL?
EndUser: I think that's the question. If we need to build these kind of screens, we are able to do it. But we need to maintain it, we need to change it, we need to
Agent: Have also money involved in that. Yeah, and you have the short with sales, we always think in the long term.
EndUser: Term and also the long term
Agent: Yeah, so it's video making this more important. Also, we're all drawn. So this is still a company that is in the beginning phase of growing. So the complexity there will also be bigger.
Agent: I think it's a really nice business case. So having one platform and front end making it more total for all the other companies in the back. So that's really interesting. But also it will increase complexity.
Agent: And this is also with customers. The complexity will increase over time. So therefore, I think it's crucial indeed.
Agent: We do agree with you approach there at first reuse, buy it if you can, and make a clear business case around this.
Agent: So, I can follow you then. But also realize that with the order it also comes with data storage.
EndUser: Management license,
Agent: So think about it, if you are importing your [ORG-4] documents into
EndUser: Orders with related [ORG-3], you will consume data storage. Yeah, that's what we look for. So that's also one of the reasons we are looking into this one as well. Yeah.
Agent: So, I think it's,
Agent: You know,
EndUser: Because they have a new one. So, someone's phone.
Agent: Also being conscious of your time, mainly any components
EndUser: You would like to demonstrate further that are new to [ORG-25] also.
EndUser: So parallel from this, maybe for us to get more feelings of the details, would it be possible to have a lorrying for this demo arc where we can also see what has been built so it?
Agent: We can judge
EndUser: Post strobe I'm a tech guy, on guy.
Agent: The hands like it.
EndUser: So I
Agent: I understand. I'm sorry, I cannot provide to this demo. This is a shared demo for our team as well. But maybe send [DATE-9] get any comp fire.
Agent: Ask, say, if you can
Agent: Say, if I am in environment, waste ground. And that will be like a friendly one. We can show you a guide. for the campfire exercises and then you can just manage that.
EndUser: And I also think because you're familiar with those course platforms, so we'll take that easy. Yeah, I think we have also when we... previously we were looking into this topic.
EndUser: We got, let's for Manufacturing cloud?
Agent: Say, a playground
EndUser: Yeah, yeah. A demo or something for Manufacturing cloud, if that, just to see what's over mass, how that little bit better on the tech side as well.
Agent: We could have something like
Agent: We can judge it a
EndUser: Because I think what we saw, it's not completely matching on each. Of course, it's a little bit different. That's what we know. We are different, but not that different.
EndUser: It's just understanding a little bit better and also, to be honest, if we want to move happiness, we need to... have to business case ready as well, say, okay, if we have this, then we don't have to do about this, there's this.
EndUser: It helps us speed up all that kind of stuff. That's, that's why we need to have a clear picture on why we think this is the road to
Agent: Follow.
Agent: Yeah. So, it's also still something you're investigating right so adding all the orders.
EndUser: To sales class also. Yes, you always do really manage all sales orders centrally in the future. But as I said, we have one another 10 companies, not all are already on even the video infrastructure.
EndUser: So it's quite a challenge in the future to have that range. But that's the angle we are aiming for. And that will not be [DATE-10], I'd say it in that way.
EndUser: I would be surprised if we would be able Yeah.
Agent: To do that.
EndUser: So a lot is happening and that's why this becomes definitely very important to, let's say, gather hand around and make a decision on which road to follow an auto management wise because if we start, let's say building custom, and it goes and grows and grows,
Agent: Managing it back to a standard is then of course all of more
Agent: Work.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: And that's all for me. Sorry, go ahead, [PERSON-1]. Thanks. So I just have one more question because you mentioned that.
Agent: So the example we've given, so that it's like say if company A, so we're sitting in the order from [ORG-28], and then we go through that. But then there's a main thing.
Agent: So you want to have one order management to capture all the orders for all your different companies
EndUser: And then manage all those orders together in one single place. Now make them visible. Managing them is a
Agent: Combination between
Agent: The peace and the orchestration. And then so there's a main so that's for example, let's say you have a self-worth platform. So either that you're using custom order management or order management.
Agent: This will be the single place you manage all the orders coming for company A and OSA or the orders coming for company B. Which means if company A has a supply order for company B.
Agent: So that into the same order Yeah.
EndUser: Order should be OSA move management.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Then say, understanding a little bit better what we are talking about. And then this means that all the different companies, so the child companies, 145 companies, order management org as well.
EndUser: They should have access to the same
Agent: Yeah, in the future, yes. Okay, I think if that's the case, I can answer you the question.
Agent: So that's how the sales order should be graded, because then say it's as I mentioned, so that's the first order comes in, and then you can have a supply order.
Agent: So the full form order for supplier, and that supplier is particular, let's say company B. And then from there, so that was order management, you can just have a link to generate another sales order.
Agent: So because we do have the new things to compose it API to Some of the chimes and scatterabilityging tasks.
Agent: Complete a new order coming in and then create a new order summary for company B and the n you can have just easily have a link . to those two orders.
EndUser: So I think that can be one sample. I a better way.
Agent: Think we need to understand
EndUser: Which is what I want to publish in these kind of situations. Yeah. So that's an important scenario. And to have that.
EndUser: Filled in roughly already by [PERCENT-4] of [PERCENT-5] of my auto management out of the box with, of course, some smoke customization. That would be already a big start, a big plus because we know that business case is coming.
EndUser: That is actually, yeah, that would be just a beginning set.
EndUser: That's one of our biggest priorities, the intercompany one, and that's going to be because that order that's going to be fulfilled by that other order, should be a sales order in their [NORP-3] system.
EndUser: That's how we have 103 companies, 149 [NORP-3] systems. So we have the highest for yeah, for these [NORP-3] systems
Agent: That need to have a sales order because for them it's a sales order.
Agent: Yeah, I think we need to consider that not only the data storage for also the API call limit as well because So I think was order management you work at another site of the API calls as well.
EndUser: So that can support you on that on that part as well Yeah So I think We need to do a little bit some bits and pieces, how are we going to organize that?
Agent: More deep dive into
EndUser: Is that something that, for example, pick up with [PERSON-1]?
Agent: Would
EndUser: Yeah, I think it would be good to have that example, really, as we have it in our head, because it would help us tremendously, having the business case ready to say, okay, Look, this is what it's doing with only minimum of configuration and then we have a business case.
EndUser: Okay, these and these and these companies want this. And we can make it, but it's going to take us [DATE-10], for example, and out of the box it's ready within, what, [DATE-14] or whatever.
EndUser: If we would have that business case and that would definitely help some time to have a call with [PERSON-1] to really point out what really actually what's the detail of this scenario and then make it even for a second call like okay if we would do it then this would be it.
EndUser: I think that would be over and maybe we can have a slight peak then of the [ORG-28] scenario because we also. also know that that's coming, that's also a big one.
EndUser: If we would have two business cases where we say, okay, this is the business case we have out of the box, ready, it is This is not a business case.
EndUser: We also know that it's coming and it's difficult to captur e it with current [ORG-45] capabilities as we have it . and we would be able to cover it.
EndUser: If we have to look, if we have this and this and this, then we have two business cases that would help us, would help all tremendously,
Agent: Yeah, supporting of implementing or the management.
EndUser: The business case
Agent: Yeah, maybe if we can have, let's say, two business say we can compare that.
EndUser: Cases and then
Agent: So if we're using order management solutions, customization may be needed and then fully new boot, so custom-built solutions or how much you need.
EndUser: How much
EndUser: Comparing to the
Agent: And then you can compare that.
EndUser: That to if Yeah.
Agent: Would you mind that to
EndUser: Share us maybe a little bit detailed business use the comparison on that.
Agent: Case and then we can we can do
EndUser: And also all the other technical stuff, every API calls and store, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, because it's somewhat direct. If we are managing all of the [ORG-29] by a one central place, it will come to love.
EndUser: Let's say storage. You know, generate tons of API goals.
Agent: So we
EndUser: Need to take that into consideration as well. And we can do it all by a meal soft, but then the result from price attached to it, because meal soft, the P goals are not cheap at all.
EndUser: Okay,
Agent: Nothing.
Agent: Yeah, and I think this is also a nice approach for [ORG-25]. So because like I learned from like I got to know [ORG-25], it's also good to have a phased approach.
EndUser: So this order of visibility can also be a first step towards... I think that's also good to add. So this is what we can do quickly and the end game would like this.
Agent: Like more or less
EndUser: And then that because... It will become a beast automatically. We talk about managing centrally orders and steering all that giving and also building automation
Agent: On it, AI or whatever, we
Agent: Are going to do in the future. Yeah, exactly. I rather call it a base task, the boot
EndUser: Is set up a beast.
Agent: But now, OK. Thank you for now.
EndUser: I think we need [PERSON-18] together.
Agent: To plan a session
EndUser: Yeah, I think I'll leave to the Rorik if he also will join, but let's... Or separately with [PERSON-1].
Agent: I can do it
EndUser: So, I'll put some [GPE-2], are your contact details in that
Agent: Meeting appointment already?
EndUser: I don't know. Yeah, they're
Agent: Very intelligent in the meeting. Okay. Yeah. But the only thing is just I will be off for [DATE-14], [DATE-14]. So, maybe we can consider, so that's
Agent: How we can schedule a time.
EndUser: Would there be time [DATE-18], because we are in kind of a manual... Make time, right?
EndUser: Time is a fluid thing. I see how you are flexible [DATE-18], far from the [DATE-18]. Yeah, I'm pretty flexible. So, I can, separately,
Agent: Which [NORP-3] yeah, it's just Yeah, yeah.
Agent: Times around, [PERSON-1]?
EndUser: Uh [TIME-2].
Agent: Say we can do that.
EndUser: Maybe we can schedule some time on [DATE-18] and then we can discuss on the [DATE-18] is pretty hard for me because then we have to [DATE-19] planning.
Agent: You were flexible.
EndUser: Yeah. I'm not sure what they both have. I'm a steward.
Agent: I wish your time [DATE-7], [PERSON-1].
EndUser: [DATE-19] is also okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll separately send to an us to my propositions.
Agent: Email with an invite
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: Okay. Thank you.
Agent: Thank you. Thank
EndUser: You. Bye.
Agent: [DATE-19]. Bye-bye.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1.

10. The rep could have provided more information on the support and maintenance services offered by Salesforce, as well as the long-term benefits of using a standard solution over a custom-built one.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer was unsure about the added value of the seller's product for their specific use case, as they were already managing their orders and were considering building their own solution. They wanted to understand if the seller's product could fulfill their requirements out-of-the-box or if they would still need to do a lot of customization and maintenance.
2. The customer was concerned about the cost and effort involved in implementing the seller's product. They wanted to weigh the benefits against the investment required, including data storage management licenses and potential API call limits.
3.

5. The customer wants to see detailed business cases and comparisons between using the seller's product and building their own solution, including the required customization, API calls, and storage.

Answer to this question is unclear:

- The customer's interest in having a separate call with [PERSON-1] to discuss the intercompany scenario and the [ORG-28] scenario in detail might indicate that they are seriously considering the seller's product. However, their concerns about the trade-off between buying and building the solution and the required customization efforts suggest that they still have reservations.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:
- ""You mentioned a feature, but how When you only have, let's say, your stock levels available. Are you going to do that? And how do you see that in a, let's say, made to order a context?""
- ""You have any questions so far for anything unclear?""
- ""So if you have the wheels from a car example, you know that in general the live production time is about 3-4 weeks for example. So meaning that if you have, and I think to try to think in your use case. So if you have the wheels from a car example, you know that in general the live production time is about 3-4 weeks for example.""
- ""So how, oh, an example is how to calculate that or, um, an example called auto management can provide those information to the software.""
- ""So I hope this journey is all clear for you. Or do you have any questions or anything that you want to see, but we're not showing here.""
- ""So if you're making a decision for order management, so you're paying on two levels, so B2B and order management. And that's clear. Yeah, with the base yeah, if you would like to go in that deeper, then we can discuss pricing, of course.""
- ""So now let's start our journey. So here's so that I'm learning as a BTV storefront, say, a very prepared car so that we can do checkouts.""
- ""So here I just want to quickly complete the checkouts. So there are a few checkouts steps to calculate the shipping, the inventory, tax and so on.""
- ""And then here I'm using a purchase order.""
- ""And then you will see that the order has been placed. And then say, as the order has been placed, you will see that you will be landing on the order management counseling on [ORG-3] platform.""
- ""So you may be familiar with that. So if you're using [PRODUCT-3] already, so it's exactly the same view.""
- ""So here I'm landing at a list to view. If I refresh the list,""
- ""And then you will see that a new order is coming in. So there's a new order so that it just placed and then it's coming right immediately.""
- ""And then I was also talking about that, say, as [ORG-18], say he can view some report on dashboard. So we do provide a sample homepage and then we're just showing you that, say, some report on dashboard here.""
- ""And then because in this demo, I don't have enough information to share. So, since it's a task arc, I can show you later in a different arc. So you'll see that there's some more data.""
- ""And then you can see that there are some open orders. And then if there's any return happens, and then they would also have a return chance or return reasons. But of course, it's not only for returns.""
- ""You can put that say on any order related quantification, for example, cancellation. Or if you provide any additional discount to the customer for different reasons, you can capture that reason and then you can show you on the dashboard here.""
- ""So now let's go and see the order details. So first of all, I want to introduce an object called order summary. So that is a new object coming was order management.""
- ""So from the name, you can see that it's summarized all the order details and a single change that has been applied to those order.""
- ""So that change can cover for the status change or the performance status change, but a so that that change can cover like any order modification, like if there's any consolation. happen to this order.""
- ""If there's any return happens, so anything happens on this order . can find the details from this order summary object .""
- ""And here you will see that we have some highlighted information about this order.""
- ""So you will see that who is customer places order when the order is placed.""
- ""What's current order status?""
- ""So waiting to fulfill main service order has been allocated. And they say the different companies or different warehouse are working to prepare those order.""
- ""And we also have the billing address and the sales channels.""

video_19771_167_6qr3y0000000900AAA,"Agent: To yourself anytime during the session, stop me then and then ask all your questions.
Agent: And we also would love to have your feedback around the platform and is it able to meet your requirements that way or not?
Agent: That is something that we would love to hear from you. So let's have a very interactive session that way. So what we are doing is that I'm currently sharing my screen.
Agent: Right and I'll just come to my deck right.
Agent: So as part of the introduction I think as part of discovery you guys already explored that you know you're looking for a tool that is helping you do email Marketing you're already users of sales and [PRODUCT-1] platform which is the core platform of [ORG-1].
Agent: [DATE-1] whatever we are going to look at is falling in another umbrella that [ORG-1] offers which is called [PRODUCT-2] and the name of the tool or the name of the platform that we are talking about is called a account engagement, especially for organizations who are int o long-sealed cycle, who are into very personalized selling This is the type of tool that we generally suggest to them o r recommend to them because this helps them nurture their custome r throughout the life cycle of the customer Attract each and every activity and action of the customer, right So that we have better idea around what is the need of the customer where is it that we can tap on the opportunity of converting thi s customer for the, for our customer brand and so o n. So, and a lot of, I would say, dash putting and reporting capabilities are also bundl ed up with this particular module so that you can understand the performance of each a nd every let's say email campaign that you're running or any other kind of initiatives th at you're taking from the Marketing side, righ t?
Agent: So we are going to look at the platform from three major perspective s. One is how my contact database is getting managed [DATE-2], righ t?
Agent: Be it existing leads in the system that I want to nurture or new people comi ng into the system. The second thing is around automation.
Agent: How is it that I am going to autom ate all my email campaigning and while I am doing that I need to have interactive email [PERSON-1] tes also built.
Agent: So how is it that will be do ne?
Agent: And the third part would be the analytics piece, where we will be talking about the reporting and dash coding capabilities.
Agent: Now, I think, [PERSON-2], you had this question that, can whatever you mentioned, can it be achieved through your existing [PRODUCT-1] platform, or you would require a separate, let's say, license or platform for that?
Agent: So I would say that, as you see on the screen, [ORG-1] offers different types of platform for different purposes or in an organization. So currently, you have the Sales Cloud platform. That is majorly focused around lead management.
Agent: That if lead comes in, then how is it that sales is going to treat that lead, take it.
Agent: To the opportunity funnel and convert them And later on, let's say the order [PERSON-3] and everything happens, right But when we take a step before that there's a very major area where Marketing has to function They have to nurture the lead to a leve l where sales people feel it's a quality leade r and a qualified lead and I can start pursuing it And that is where [PRODUCT-2] will come into picture So it is actually a separate module a separate platform that [ORG-1] offers But it comes and so on .
Agent: On top of your sales cloud. So if we see from a technical architecture [ORG-2] e, they are seamlessly bidirectionally integrated modules. Your Sales Cloud will be the core or the bottom layer.
Agent: And on top of that, there will be [ORG-3] coming and sitting on to [ORG-4], right?
Agent: So that is how it is placed architecturally so that we are having that sync between t he two team, between the Marketing and sales team.
Agent: But apart from that, Marketing is a big umbrel la inside sales force, righ t?
Agent: Today [PERSON-4], me, the [ORG-5], we all represent [PRODUCT-2] and the DX portfol io. And the portfolio consists of so many different options for a market ye ar.
Agent: So depending on What is the vision on the requirements of a marketer, whether they are into B2B or B2C space, if they are retail marketers, we suggest them the right kind of modules.
Agent: So, by understanding your requirements and looking at the discovery session that we had, we thought that we will definitely show you Account Engagement modules, which we feel that can add a lot of value to your Marketing team's performance and efficiency.
Agent: So that is a quick introduction. Now, as I mentioned that there are three major domains and areas that we are going to cover. So that is something that is listed out here.
Agent: A lot of this benefit from this particular module will be also given to your sales teams.
Agent: So I'll show you those screens and snippets where sales can leverage this data from Marketing side and have a better communication when they are communicating with the customer or the clients.
Agent: This module again is for the efficient growth of both your Marketing and sales teams together . module is able to unite both of them onto a single [ORG-1] ecosystem of Sales Cloud and Account Engagement .
Agent: Now, this is like an art of possible journey, right?
Agent: What is the maximum extent of this particular module?
Agent: According to your requirements, you can decide that, okay, these are the areas that I would like to focus on.
Agent: And these are the areas that maybe are not meant for me, right?
Agent: And that is completely fine. But this is the end to end capability journey of this particular module.
Agent: What is it that it is able to do?
Agent: The first step that you see is Getting customer data, right?
Agent: Now if we take a live example, somebody can come to your website and maybe send an inquiry.
Agent: Somebody can come to your social media page and register from there or maybe fill up a lead gen page, right?
Agent: People can attend webinars, seminars, any kinds of events that you might have. There are multiple ways through which in general organizations create leads from.
Agent: They already have some time an [PRODUCT-3] database which they directly want to upload and start nurturing to that customer. And we welcome. that.
Agent: So, any such activity that you are doing to generate lead dat a that can all be done with the help of [ORG-6] platform, your accounting engagement, right?
Agent: So emails can be sent, landing pages can be created with the help of forms and landing pages. Your website can be integrated with the platform.
Agent: Different other sources can also be integrated and then social media, [ORG-7] are all we are having partnerships with. So again, we have direct integrations for that.
Agent: Now, once I have my customer data in a single place as a marketer, My half job is done. I have a complete view of my customer data. There are no duplicates which are there again in the system present.
Agent: I can easily segment out this data. Let's say based on geographies, certain doctors are there and surgeons are there who are in [LOC-1], certain are there in [LOC-2] region.
Agent: So all those bifocations I can be creating inside the platform. Once I have that, what do I do next is start my automated campaigns. I have my customer ready.
Agent: Why don't I reach out to them?
Agent: While I'm reaching out to them how can I automate this whole process So if I'm sending email one based on the reaction on email one email two should be automatically sent That is where the drip campaigning will come in While we are running the drip campaigns you can also understand the activity of the customer So there are a lot of options to track the customer activity Once you're done with this whole process it's a new lead in the system You feel it's a very hot lead for the business Why don't I now assign this to the sales tea m?
Agent: And that is when the hand holding will happen and you will say I have found the Marketing qualified lea d, take it over and convert it into an opportunity and it becomes a very simple easy process for my sales team as well because this lead is quite qualified in natur e. They don't have to deal with junk leads in the system [PERSON-5]: Apart from that, marketer will get the complete view of what is happening to the leads which they have qualified from their side, have nurtured from their side.
Agent: If you want to reach out to these leads, let's say do a remarketing on social media channels apart from email, you can do that also.
Agent: So they are not just getting emails from from and they can also be seeing advertisements on [ORG-8] and [ORG-9] from right. So that kind of a targeted campaign can be run from the platform itself.
Agent: So these are the functionalities that we would also be covering in parts as part of the session. But that is how I plan the agenda for [DATE-2]'s demo session.
Agent: And from here onwards, we'll be switching to the actual demo environment.
Agent: But before we do that, I just have to take a quick pause here and ask you, [PERSON-6] and [PRODUCT-4], are we good to go ahead?
Agent: Are we in line with your expectations?
Agent: And are there any questions so far for any of us ?
Speaker 4: No man, we are good to go. I would like to see the demo on session.
Speaker 5: But I just have a quick question you say that, you know, this is a completely new, what do you call module, I mean, other than the Sales Cloud thing.
Agent: Man. So when
Speaker 5: So what happens to the accounts and the contacts, whatever we have in the present module.
Speaker 5: So even if we go for the Marketing cloud, those data automatically comes in over here, again, we have to recreate certain things in the Marketing cloud.
Agent: So, the ability that is the beauty of having this one ecosystem, when you have Marketing also from [ORG-1] side and when you let's say enable this particular environment, automatically your existing data can be synced to Marketing automation, right?
Agent: So, all your existing accounts, contacts, leads, whatever you want to bring it here, you can also put a filter in between and say I don't want to bring everything, that can also be done, but whatever you want to bring onto this side of the table, you can do that.
Agent: So, that's See, we have actually established a bidirectional native connector . not even a custom sync or a link that has to be created by anybody .
Agent: Automatically there is a connector that we provide and with the help of that connector the data gets synced in [DATE-3]. Yeah
Speaker 5: Fine, okay. Thank you
Agent: Perfect. So what we are doing is we are changing our window. Now we have taken that scenario where already my customers data has been brought into my system.
Agent: It could be again from multiple sources and that [ORG-10] is always possible. That is why I have your website open here itself. Sorry, but ask for this.
Agent: Let's say what happened, right?
Agent: So as a marketer, you start your day, you log into your system. You have this kind of a dashboard created for you. You can also, by the way, have your own custom views for the home page.
Agent: Let's say you want your task list coming in here. You want your own calendar coming in here. That is not a problem. All those configurations can be done in the platform.
Agent: But here, what you see is the dashboard where marketer can see their calendar, like whatever tasks are scheduled for the team, what types of automation. should be shooting out right now. All that can be seen here.
Agent: The trend so far that oka y in [DATE-4] let's say . how many prospects have we been generating so far for the business and so on.
Agent: And then you have this table where you can see active prospects for review, which are basically the recently created and uploaded list of prospects. So these are the people who are there and obviously you can extend this list.
Agent: There is no limit around that. But I want to do is I want to look at the complete list of contacts which are there with the Marketing team for nurturing purposes.
Agent: So for that I go to the prospect tab and here I'll be able to see all the contacts which are there [DATE-2]. It is helping me put all the contacts in a centralized place firstly.
Agent: Now I'm not sure if you guys have worked on the [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-5] but the [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-5] and the accounting engagement platform that you currently see are both built technically on the same infrastructure .
Agent: Call it the lightning user interface of [ORG-1] . proprietary to us . look and feel of all our native platform s are like this only . are similar . easy to navigate .
Agent: Tabs are there , just have to enter the tab and perform your task .
Agent: Is what you have to do, right ?
Agent: For somebody, let's say , [GPE-1] , guys have access to both Sales Cloud and Marketing [DATE-2], right ?
Agent: Want to toggle between systems [DATE-5] .
Agent: What you can do is it's an app through the same login you'll be able to log in between different solutions and different applications built on [ORG-13] So it's like that, it's that kind of an Integration that we are talking abou t. Now coming to my contact base, right?
Agent: This is the prostate databas e. It has all the leads which are there new as well as let's say assigned converted into [ORG-9] Now how do I distinguish between the m?
Agent: So visually if you see there is a cloud icon attached to the leads who are assigne [NORP-1] to a Sales rep or who are present in your [PRODUCT-5], rig ht?
Agent: The leads or the prospects which doesn't have a cloud ic on, they are the people who are new in the syst em.
Agent: Let's say this person does not exist right now in your C RM, rig ht?
Agent: So that is a clear [ORG-18] on. Visually you can see anybody with a cloud i con basically is present in my C RM.
Agent: Somebody who is not having a cloud i con is just present with my Marketing team to day and is waiting, I mean waiting to be qualifi ed.
Agent: Pass P OARY Other than that, I have these good views created for myself. So I can see who are my maleable prospects, because sometimes people are [ORG-13]-maleable, they unsubscribe.
Agent: So you can see by that perspective as well, that who have unsubscribed to me, who are assigned to like this, we have these ready list views for you so that you can bifurcate your customer data based on their activity when they were created based on all these filters as well.
Agent: But what you can do next is also segment people out. you an example of segmentation list. These are the various types of segmentation lists that I'v e already created. These can be bifurcated into old leads and hot leads.
Agent: And you can have multipl e criterias to do that. You can have competitors versus customers. You can say that people who ar e looking for a job sometimes buy a mistake, fill up a form.
Agent: So they can be falling in some differen t bucket altogether. You can see basis on sources.
Agent: Somebody is generated from [ORG-9], somebody i s generated from the website somebody's generated from the webinar or the eve nt that you had at that particular dat e. So basis that you want to do a segmentatio n, all that is possible on the platfor m. So this is how you can very easily create dynamic segmen ts and then nurture them in a very personalized mann that [PERSON-7]: But coming to my contact databas e, so let's say [DATE-2] I have one pers on as one of my contact s. Let's say this is Dr. [PERSON-8] or Mr. [PERSON-9] r, working in certain kind of a ke y. clinic or hospital and so on and we are trying to reach out to them.
Agent: So mind you by [GPE-2], my apologies, this is a demo environment. So we can't play a lot around the data, but I'm still trying to create a use kit out of it.
Agent: So this is Mr [PERSON-8] and that is the complete 255 prospect profile of [PERSON-8], right?
Agent: This whole area is dedicated to a sin gle person. If you see on the left hand side, we had the [ORG-18] table under which we h ave each and every d ay.
Agent: Of information that is given to me either by the customer or by the Sales rep who intera cted with the customer or with the doctor, right?
Agent: So they'll be having all this informat ion.
Agent: Certain fields might be different according to how you have set it up in your CRM, [PERSON-10]?
Agent: So in your sales cloud, if there is no account, if there is a hospital in the place of an acco unt, that is fine. Automatically, you'll see a hospital here, something like t hat.
Agent: What is more important here is this source campaign, right?
Agent: Marketing spends a lo t of time and eff ort. resources in regarding these [ORG-18] igns.
Agent: So it is very important to know at a prospect level what campaign is this particular person is a part of from where we generated this lead from. Right.
Agent: So again source campaign can be automatically attached to a profile or maybe manually done so then comes the second part. Right. So this is all very standard. But when it comes to Marketing automation, the specialty here is.
Agent: Tracking each and every activity of the prospect.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Now, what are these types of activities?
Agent: If you see, these are the categories which are listed out.
Agent: Anybody who visits me on the website, right?
Agent: Clicks on anything, gets redirected, let's say from social media to website, explores any pages, spends time on the pages, right?
Agent: All that activity can be very easily tracked here, right?
Agent: The next thing here is emails.
Agent: So if you are sending an email and nobody is making any contact with the email, neither they are opening or they are interacting, nothing is happening, you should immediately put that contact out of the database or maybe put it in an interim basis that maybe this person is not so active or not interested right now, right?
Agent: But somebody who is showing too much interest in every type of communication you are sending, interacting a lot, registering themselves let's say for any kind of... event that you're having and so on is an active user is a person who is having inclinatio n towards your brand So all this tracking that we are doing from emails to events to webinars website [ORG-9] r you're doing that whole activity logs gets generated here .
Agent: It's completely up to you, say that, OK, I don't want to track my website. That is fine.
Agent: You can you can stop that from happening, right?
Agent: But we give you from our side that particular option that you can track the customer on all these different sources basis, which automatically the system can score them. This this scoring is configurable in nature.
Agent: You can decide that, OK, a strongman customer who opens this very important email should be scored plus three plus five plus 42 as well sometimes, right?
Agent: So that scoring can be decided.
Agent: Decided by you and automatically then the system is scoring the customer What you are getting at the end is the overall score of the customer This is a very important aspect of this particular platform This is how we identify a hot .
Agent: Quality qualified lead in the business. We say that this person has shown a lot of engagement and hence the score is high, quickly assign it to the sales team.
Agent: Simultaneously, there is also very important to understand the profile of a customer. These now, everything cannot be quantitative. Certain qualitative aspect has to be there to qualification process.
Agent: So let's say who would be a good or idle lead for a business, somebody who is a doctor, somebody who is.
Agent: Let's say a dental surgeon, somebody who is still in practice, there can be so many differen t things that you're looking for in an idle lead for your business, right So put that all as different criteria, basis which do certain kind of a great adjustment .
Agent: So plus a if let's say somebody is a dental surgeon, it's a good, very good lead for your business.
Agent: Now what will happen is basis on these criteria's met, automatically a grade is assigned to the profile of the customer.
Agent: You use a combination of grading and scoring and say, this is an engaged lead as well as a very good ideal lead for my business.
Agent: And together as a combination, I want to quickly assign it to the sales team and the assignment is also automated, right?
Agent: You're using Sales Cloud and that is the benefit that you'll be getting . sales team instantly whenever somebody reaches the criteria will automatically hav e that lead assigned to them and they can start pursuing them .
Agent: Marketing doesn't have to push anything from their side as such, right ?
Agent: Can pass on notes . can say that, okay, this lead has to be, you know , in [DATE-6] or so time .
Agent: Notes that you want to share with the sales team, you can do that .
Agent: From that, since we are talkin g about heavy emailing, right?
Agent: You mentioned that sales force doesn't allow more than 42 00 per day from the system.
Agent: There's a reason to that because [PRODUCT-1] platfo rm is built for sales teams and sales people, right?
Agent: It's not built for Marketing mass emailin g. That is why that kind of a restriction is there because at the end it's all about IPs, domains and so on. On the other hand, Marketing Cloud has no such restrictions.
Agent: So one of your questions I think which was there is and the challenge which was there, I think that gets cleared here itself, that you have no limits on how many emails you can send per day, right?
Agent: And that is very well managed because this platform is well aware of how mass emailing works, right?
Agent: So mailability of every customer is getting tracked. If they instantly unsubscribe, if there's a hard bounce, if there's a soft bounce, you can set up actions in the system itself.
Agent: Two maintain the hygiene right and protect your IP domains that is very important as a Marketing . as a marketer. Apart from that, additional fields and multiple other custom fields can be created.
Agent: These fields can be synced with your CRM again. A lot of data exchange basically can happen between sales and marketing. That is the truth about this whole [ORG-1] prospect 274 profile that we are talking about.
Agent: Apart from that, for every customer, since we can be talking about multiple cross cells and up cells, there is a complete view around the timeline and the life cycle of a customer So when was it that the customer interacted What happened next from your side What emails did they open When was it that they attended a webinar All that data comes to you And from sales side as well, you assigned a prospec t to the sales team What happened next How much time did sales take to qualify this need When they qualified as an opportunity or did they sa y that this is not ?
Agent: Good quality lea d. All this will come back to you in the form of the life cycle. You can get the complete view after also the handover has happened. Right.
Agent: So this is also very good for bringing in transparency in the business between sales and marketing. So this was the first part from the marketer side.
Agent: What is it that we are building as a contact database?
Agent: Obviously, this is a very extensive view of a single person's profile. You can say I'm just limited to five fields and five custom fields and I don't want more than that and that's absolutely fine.
Agent: But this is the extent to which we can go apart from that.
Agent: Now, just switching it a little bit, what if this particular person Mr. [PERSON-8] becomes qualified in the business, gets assigned to the sales team, right?
Agent: And they believe in a, you are, let's say, handling the sales or [PRODUCT-5]. This lead comes to you and gets assigned to you. But what happens is you get this complete segment here on the lead page.
Agent: You have the score, the grade, every detail, whatever notes were passed on to you, whatever details about the lead page. lead was passed on to you. All that is there .
Agent: But apart from that, a very important factor is engagement history, which is right now on the right-hand side of the page.
Agent: For every lead, since we were here talking about this log of activity the customer is doing, the same log is shared with the sales team.
Agent: So if my customer, let's say I attended a webinar by [ORG-25] [DATE-7] and then gets assigned to me as a lead, I have that idea.
Agent: So when I pick up the phone or I go and meet Dr. [PERSON-8], I'll say, hey sir, I got to know that you attended the webinar, how was your experience and start my selling talk from that point onwards.
Agent: It gives a very good context to the Sales rep that okay, what is the engagement that has been happening so far for this particular.
Agent: Lead with the Marketing team So this is an automatically occurring I would say component of this particular vie w where engagement history is provided Later what can happen is I can go and mee t this particular doctor He can say that yes, I was really interested but not right now Can you call me after [DATE-8] Right Now what is it that the Sales rep will do Sales rep has very limited options in [LOC-3] to nurture a caste But with Marketing automation, they have these two options coming in her e. So this lead can be added back to a prospect list, which is nothing but a nurturing segmen t, which is created by [PERSON-13] So you're handing over this lead back to Marketing saying th at It will take them [DATE-8].
Agent: Why don't you keep nurturing them or from their side if they don't want to do that, they want to directly add somebody to an engagement program which is an automated nurture that can also be done.
Agent: So that is how you complete the cycle that if the lead is not nurtured or not qualified, how does it come back to the Marketing funnel may be for further nurturing process.
Agent: So that is the first segment that we wanted to focus on. I'll take a quick pause again. If you guys have any questions here on what is happening, how we are able to accomplish this, please let me know.
Agent: I would love to answer those questions. And if you want
Speaker 5: To share anything as well.
Speaker 5: No, what comes to my mind is that I understand the first example when you say it's a complete new prospect, I understand.
Speaker 5: Now, once it's moved to the or forwarded to the sales team and we go ahead with the sales in the same [PRODUCT-2] page for a particular [ORG-18] or a particular customer, what we see, can we see their sales as well?
Speaker 5: Like what is the sales done from the auto module, what we have in the sales module, sales cloud. like you are giving us 257 degree view page, right, where we have all the details.
Speaker 5: Can you also capture it from the sales cloud, the, you know, the orders, please, at least the market gets an understanding. Like this is the sales, what is happening for this particular person, particular account.
Speaker 5: And accordingly, the mass mailing thing, the [ORG-18]
Agent: Of the mailing thing would play a part into it. Absolutely, you can do that. So if you see your opportunity stage, we are definitely tracking it. That is out of the box.
Agent: But beyond that also at an order level or at a quotation level also, if you want to bring in any information, you can have customizations built for that.
Agent: You can have a different field built for that and you can understand what products did the particular person go for.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Or what was the order amount for which this particular went forth?
Agent: But if you want to see when opportunities are built, you can see opportunity price, opportunity amount and so on.
Agent: So basis that also if you want to run any campaigns, put anybody in a separate segment, all this would be possible.
Agent: So that is the purpose that the sales is doing a lot of things, but that visibility is not given to the marketing.
Agent: So how we can bring it at every customer level, you'll be able to view that here in the org itself. So if there is an information that is not out of the box, it from [PRODUCT-1] .
Speaker 5: Maybe we can create a custom field and bring Yep.
Agent: Okay. Yep. Now, I also, I mean from your what you mentioned just now that, you know, there what about the customers who are existing in your [PRODUCT-5], there would be, I'm sure, accounts which would be there.
Agent: So I'll take that turn as well, right?
Agent: So from here, I'm going to an actual account, right?
Agent: [DATE-1], let's say you have this fictitious account, [ORG-21], under which I'm sure you must have mapped multiple stakeholders also. Certain people would be from procurement sites. Certain people would be.
Agent: From Medical side and so on So you'll be mapping all those peopl e under a specific account, under a specific clini c and saying that, okay, I want to nurture these people I would be inviting these people These are my top accounts You've identified all that, right Now, what you don't get is that, okay these are the stakeholders How can I compare and start an upsell cross-sell conversatio n and who is the right person to start a conversation with Right So that is an intelligence that [ORG-3] will bring to your.. .
Agent: Rep also and your Marketing team [PERSON-9]: So anybody who you know wishes to start a conversati on in a specific account, let's say an RM is ther e, an account executive is ther e, who is responsible for this [PERSON-18] At an account leve l, they'll see something known as an engageme nt history dashboard agai n. Now, how do you read this dashboar d?
Agent: These are all the contacts mapped to this one [PERSON-18] Right now, in [DATE-9], you can adjust the timelines by the wa y.
Agent: In [DATE-10], you have all the contact s. these five different contacts, right?
Agent: And what is this number suggesting?
Agent: This is the number of activities that these people have done with my brand, right?
Agent: So if it says 25 activities or campaigns, this person has touched upon or has been a part of that is impressive, right?
Agent: So t hat is something that is showing us that there will be few people in an account also who are more act ive than the othe rs. Now this is one part of it.
Agent: Let's say I've identified [PERSON-13] as a good customer and I should be if I want to sell in [ORG-21] as an account, I should be starting my approach with [PERSON-13]. So I click on his name.
Agent: Now, what do I get here is you see the campaign activities. This is the list of all the 25 things that he has been doing, let's say, with me. So he was part of certain social media redirects.
Agent: Let's say [ORG-7] as well. Maybe he's exploring me and browsing about me. He was part of certain webinars, seminars, events also. He's part of a lot of email campaigns that my Marketing is doing.
Agent: So Marketing is running these campaigns, tracking it.
Agent: But, sending this intelligence to the person who is responsible for this account and thi s gives me a good context that, okay, I should be starting off with a conversation with thi s particular person You can do it the other way around Let's say [DATE-7] you had a fabulous webinar .
Agent: You want to know whoever who are the people who attended this particular webinar from this account.
Agent: So I let's say click on this particular activity and I get to know from this account omega, there are two people, two stakeholders who actually participated in this particular activity. So this is a very beautiful, very good insight.
Agent: You get exact names of the people that you should be targeting from now onwards. And somewhere or the other, I would say this is also in line with account-based marketing, a very popular practice [DATE-13].
Agent: If you don't want to do it full-fledged, at least this will give you a flavor and understanding of how to identify top accounts and how to target people in those accounts.
Agent: So that is an account view that is also provided.
Agent: Now... all these people at the end have to be nurtured, right And for that, we need to build an automated campaign So this is where the automated campaign building happens We are coming back to [ORG-25] platform .
Agent: Under the automation step, we have a tool called engagement studio. Now, engagement studio can run multiple campaigns altogether.
Agent: How are these campaigns built?
Agent: So you start with this particular step where you configure a campaign.
Agent: This can be any campaign, newsletter campaign, promotional campaigns, education related campaigns, you want to educate, you are bringing in a new product, you want doctors to know about it, that can be considered as a campaign.
Agent: So there can be multiple scenarios, right?
Agent: What you decide here is who would be a part of this campaign who would be a part of the recipient list, right For that you have to select segments You can select multiple segments as well There is an option of suppression also If you have a database of let's say 108 competitors, right You don't want them to receive this particular email Why don't you just put all of them into a suppression list That can also be done very easily Now after you've done the initial configuration what do you do next is It's a simple click tool .
Agent: A campaign by just adding steps like actions, triggers and rule s. In that way, this whole platform is very easy to use. There is no, I would say coding required for building anything.
Agent: So if I want to send an email initially, what do I do is I just click on an action. I select send an email. I just select a template and schedule the email.
Agent: That's it, right?
Agent: What else can I do as an action is?
Agent: If I'm sending an email, can I also create a task on top of that?
Agent: That if somebody opens or may be open. you react to that particular email, the salesperson should know about it, they should receiv e a task around it that please make a call to this person.
Agent: Can I set up a notification My counterpart here, they should be notified about each and every person who is registerin g for an event.
Agent: So these are the various things apart from just sending a communication yo u can do internally. Add people to a segment . add them to a campaign altogether, adjust their scores.
Agent: All these are different types of actions that you can take. Now, when you're selecting an action, there's also a trigger where you listen to the customer. Now these triggers can be like this.
Agent: So if I'm sending an email, email should be opened, right?
Agent: Now which email should be opened and also decide what is the maximum time you want to wait for that action to be listened to, right?
Agent: So that can also be done here.
Agent: Then there are rules, right?
Agent: Now let's say you're targeting people who are doctors who are dental surgeons, but only who have mentioned in their address that they're coming from [GPE-3] and [ORG-25] region, right?
Agent: You can have that kind of a custom. of you know, very personalized campaign built .
Agent: For that, you would have to pull a filter her e that I want to reach out to people only who have , say city mentioned as [GPE-3] and [ORG-25] .
Agent: That is a rule, a filter that would be set [ORG-21] in the whole drip campaign . that is done with the help of rules . this is how , the drip campaigns are built.
Agent: Now how I have built it is that I am doing a simple nurture of customers, but before I start sending any communication, I do a basic grade in a score check.
Agent: Once that happens, if you see there is a branching that is happening at every stage, then I'm sending an email, the initial first email, understanding whether that email was opened by my customer or not.
Agent: If the email is opened, my counterpart, [PERSON-18], be is getting notifications around it If the email is not opened, suddenly the next emai l would pop up to the customer's inbox So automatically that is being sent And then you can decide that, OK, for [DATE-9] I'm going to wait until certain for m has been completed by the customer which I attached with this email .
Agent: Now, if that also doesn't happen, none of my emailers were opened, firstly, I'm decreasing their score, right?
Agent: Because I want to mention this in the system that this person may be a little inactive, right?
Agent: So I want to decrease their score.
Agent: But what else can I do?
Agent: Can I change the channel of communication altogether?
Agent: Maybe people are not that active on email as a channel and I can show them an advertisement on social media. I can do a retargeting campaign on social media.
Agent: So from here itself, I can push people to a [ORG-8] or [ORG-9], a [ORG-7], any kind of ad ad audience, a custom audience, and push this custom audience to that particular social media channel.
Agent: Right?
Agent: And maybe that can work. And there in social media platform, I can just put a link to a landing page.
Agent: So that when the person sees that post, clicks on that link, comes back to the landing page, I'm again able to track that person.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So at least my whole cycle would be complete. Now once I've built this whol e I would say drip campaign and again the complexity how you want to strategize is up to you.
Agent: How do you want to build any campaign?
Agent: When you want to test it, just click on begin test and see for every type of branch how you know you can test it whether it's performing fine or not, whether there are no overlaps.
Agent: There is also a log that is getting generated here. Once all of this is done, you just launch this whole campaign for your customers. And later, what you see is very insightful.
Agent: You see the report for every campaign here itself. It's a visually appealing report, I would say, because it's very easy to read and understand.
Agent: Right?
Agent: You can see that every stage, whatever has happened, you're able to read that. That, OK, this campaign started with 55 people. The initial email was sent to 10 people.
Agent: Because I had put certain filters And after that, out of 10, seven maybe have rea d any either of my emails, right ?
Agent: Now?
Agent: I want to know who are these people. So these are all clickable reports. I click on the number. I get the list of all the 10 people who received my initial email.
Agent: I get to know there was an email bounce that happens. So that data also comes to me.
Agent: When was it that this email was processed?
Agent: So all this information comes to me as a report, and I can also extract this data in the form of a CS week. So that is the power of automation.
Agent: This whole journey can go on and on for [DATE-18], but you have built it once and now you I mean, it's just running on your behalf, right It is very different from any kind of emaile r that you would be sending through Sales Cloud because Sales Cloud may you can't be creating such trip campaigns You would have to utilize a flow and for a flow you would be requiring an administratio n and all these things are required .
Agent: Because it's a lead management platform at the end.
Agent: Here there is no limitation on sending an email and all this can be built by the Marketing team itself, right?
Agent: So that is how automations are carried out. I'll take my questions are there, please let me know.
Speaker 4: Quick pause. If any
Agent: No question for myself. Okay, thank you. So, not to mention, but I mean, this was a use case that I wanted to discuss, but apart from that, there are small scenarios, let's say.
Agent: Somebody fills up a form and you want to instantly send an auto reply email saying, thank you for filling up a form. So again, all these things can also be achieved through automation.
Agent: I mean, just below engagement studio, you have automation rules which can be utilized for all these different purposes as well.
Agent: But when it comes to a complete engagement program, that is where you would be building this kind of a campaign.
Agent: Now coming to the next part of your HTML emails, right?
Agent: So any Marketing email [DATE-13] are actually HTML emails only. So we have something known as an email editor, like a lightning email editor, which provides you with two options.
Agent: There is a drag and drop editor for you to easily maneuver around templates and create these email templates. There's also an HTML template editor. Sometimes organizations require that. They want to play around with HTML. TMLCSS coding.
Agent: So both options are there, right ?
Agent: Now, if you see this editor, you can edit out create [ORG-18] here itself is very easy to create [ORG-18] using this kind of a template.
Agent: I have right now, you know, put in a lot of text, which is personalized as well.
Agent: Right here, you can see the recipient's first name is mentioned, right?
Agent: So automatically, the first name will populate here.
Agent: Then you can see, you know, there's a CPA, there's a button, there is a link attached to it, there are logos, all these things can be put in here, there are very easily in the email builder Once you have built the email, then there is a testing process So for testing , Either you can go ahead with traditional testing options like testing it for a list or maybe testing it internally for your team members.
Agent: But there's also another option. We have something known as a lightning render email test. So what you can do is there is this kind of a report that's get generated after you run this kind of a render test.
Agent: This is showing me and giving me a preview that if the same email is opened, let's say, in a dark mode, let's say in a [ORG-25], maybe somebody using a mobile iPhone, how is it that the same email would be viewed by all of them?
Agent: Is a very good view without even sending an email, you are able to get that view. [PERSON-18] was for the email body, but same thing can be seen for the subject line.
Agent: How is it tha t the subject line would be seen inside different inboxes and the most important feature her e is spam analysis .
Agent: Sometimes our templates don't pass through the spam filters because they are not built in the correct way. So here you can check whether your email templates would be able to pass through all these various spam filters.
Agent: Even if that is not happening, what you can do is system can give you suggestions that hey, make these changes come back to us, render it again, and maybe next time, you'll be able to pass through all the spam filters.
Agent: So that is how emails are built and tested on the platform. And you can run the traditional [NORP-2] testing procedures for these emailers. You can also manage unsubscribe pages and preference pages from here.
Agent: So if somebody wants to unsubscribe to your communication, how they can do it very easily.
Agent: Or if they want to say that, okay, I am not interested in promotional campaigns, but I'm interested in educational campaigns, right?
Agent: If you're launching a new product, let me know. But if you're promoting a product, then don't communicate to me. So that is something known as preference pages. So on a preference page, customers can select all that.
Agent: So that makes our Marketing much more effective that way. So that can also be managed from here itself.
Agent: I think you, [PERSON-9], you mentioned dynamic [ORG-18] also, right?
Agent: So yes, our emails do support dynamic content, right?
Agent: I am just showing you an example of an industry dynamic content. So basically the variation here is somebody who's industry, I don't have.
Agent: Let's say this is a banner image, right?
Agent: If I don't have the industry here, then they will see a default banner image A.
Agent: But if they have mentioned that they are coming from a Manufacturing industry, they will see a Manufacturing banner on the same email template which can be our image banner B On the other hand, what is happening is when they are coming from a retail industry, they can all see banners, see image on the same email template.
Agent: So, email template remains one. A part of that template communication can be custom and can be dynamic in nature based on who the receiver is.
Agent: So, that is a beautiful thing that you don't have to build multiple templates to cater to a personalized communication. the communication in the same, I mean without putting too much human effort as well .
Agent: Apart from that, contents also take care of your forms and landing pages. I will just quickly show you.
Agent: Let's say you want certain information from your customer, you want them to register, you want to know about them, you want to understand whether they have changed their email address, whether they have changed their phone number, whether the address is same or not, whatever information if you want that to be shared through, let's say a form and a landing page, you can have these kinds of landing pages built for your customers, right?
Agent: Again, like that. how we built emails. Similar is this scenario here. There's a drag and drop editor, no HTML CSS coding required . but you will have this kind of a planning page created for your customers.
Agent: This is a basic example. Some of our customers have built beautiful websites and micro sites on it, and that is also possible. You can have video streaming, here, blocks posted, all that can be also done.
Agent: That is how the complete [ORG-18] piece is handled inside [ORG-1]. from your emails, landing pages, firms, dynamic content, all of that will reside.
Agent: It's a one-stop shop for you to create contents, send it, and dispatch it to your customers, and understand how those customers are reacting to those campaigns. This was the second part.
Agent: I think the last part that we are left with is the analytics and dashboarding capabilities.
Agent: The easiest and best part of the platform is that the analytics is completely out of the box You don't have to generate reports, pull out reports all that is not possible Whatever data you need you need to understand campaign ROI we have a campaign dashboard You can compare campaigns based on various [ORG-24] s around ROI, revenue, whatever you want to track you can track all that .
Agent: I think [PERSON-25] mentioning, let's say Revenue generated. So we have something known as a life cycle, I mean life cycle dashboard. So here you can see that what is the funnel looking like, the conversion funnel.
Agent: These are not just numbers but clickable in nature. So you can actually explore who are these 39 people. But what you get to know is how much Revenue you generated as a Marketing organization for the business.
Agent: How much time on an average do you take for converting the customer from one stage to another?
Agent: What is the total turnaround time?
Agent: Where is it that you are facing a challenge or a bottleneck is created inside this whole journey?
Agent: So you get that complete view as well. So all this will be there.
Agent: Apart from that, just one last report around emailers, right?
Agent: So if you're sending an email, you complete deliverability, or delivery status, all that is mapped here. So for a single email like this, I get this kind of a report generated, where I have delivery rate, Interaction information.
Agent: If people actually read my emails, are they just coming through it?
Agent: All that data comes to me very easily, right?
Agent: So these are all your reports. Apart from that, we are extending certain dashboards.
Agent: To you, right?
Agent: These dashboards again are out of the box. They can be beneficial to you So we are having these 5 to 6 dashboards that you can use.
Agent: Firstly, there's a Marketing manager dashboard, right ?
Agent: When a Marketing manager at [DATE-13] wants to understand What is exactly happening?
Agent: Let's say in my organization, what is the team doing, how is the Marketing team performing and so on?
Agent: Then he can just look into this particular dashboard. There's a [FAC-1] health segment, there's an engagement health segment, he can compare both and understand all the information. Then there is another dashboard, that is an engagement dashboard.
Agent: So what happens here is, let's say [DATE-2], first, from when you have around 27, templates, email templates created. Now you want to compare how together these particular templates are performing.
Agent: So here is my template section in the engagement dashboard. I have the list of all the templates. Based on total opens, which particular template is performing best.
Agent: I can see that when I click on it, the complete data changes. These are clickable interactable dashboards so that you can use filters, click on numbers and the complete data will give you information around what you can do.
Agent: Whatever you have selected, right So like this, you can do for forms you can do for landing pages different KPIs are being mappe d and you can do it for list emails as well .
Agent: The last one here that we would love to conclude the session with is, sorry, coming back to it, is multi-touch attribution.
Agent: If you are running [DATE-2] multiple campaigns altogether, sometimes it's difficult for Marketing teams to understand how to calculate the ROI of a campaign.
Agent: The reason for that is a single customer can come across multiple touch points in a campaign. So Mr. [PERSON-21] here was a doctor.
Agent: In [DATE-18], he could be a part of so many different campaigns that you conducted.
Agent: So for that, what industry [DATE-2] is doing is creating these models There's a first touch campaign model there's a last touch model there's an even distribution model These are industry created models We have mimic the same in our I mean in our dashboarding capabilities as well So in the first touch model let's say your company is running all these campaigns I want to focus on [ORG-7] So I click on the campaign I get to know the ROI of this particular campaign .
Agent: And all the details around this campaign, right?
Agent: But what I further can do is if [ORG-27] is one of my top accounts and let's say all these three, let's say [ORG-24], social is another account that I have, now I select these accounts and I want to know how is this campaign performing for these accounts that I have.
Agent: So for my top accounts, this campaign, [ORG-7] is giving me negative results. So this is how in a click your data completely changes. In general, [ORG-7] is giving me was doing amazing .
Agent: But when it comes to top accounts, top three accounts, top 10 accounts, [ORG-27], not the right kind of let's say campaign that you should be using to nurture these people.
Agent: So that is how you can read these dashboards very easily and understand that information.
Agent: So with that, I think we come to an end of the whole demonstration that we wanted to take you through in three parts, contact management, data management, automation, and the last part was analytics. And I think...
Agent: I think you must have understood that this is not just an emailing tool that we are talking about This is a module that will definitely come and sit on top of your Sales Cloud but it has a lot to offer to both sales and Marketing sides of business So I'll give it back to everybody I'll open it for questions and answers, feedback and deciding upon the next steps Also, my teammates here [PERSON-4],
Agent: They do, you guys want to add in anything, please do that .
Agent: Yeah, no, I just wanted to gather all the feedback of the team on what we saw.
Speaker 6: Do you think it makes sense as value?
Speaker 6: Is it in line with what you were expecting?
Speaker 6: Any other certain features that you might
Speaker 4: Not have been expecting if you could just share the thoughts on the same?
Speaker 4: Yes, they did a possible thank you [PERSON-25] for such a lovely presentations. This account management thing is very comprehensive and I think as you rightly said it sits on top of it when we have like something for sales.
Speaker 4: But for Marketing and managing account and helping sales person, you know, and actually measuring your campaign effectively, this will really help in her past.
Speaker 4: So my question here is, so to get this product, I mean, what is the subscription fee, like a pricing structure?
Speaker 6: If you can help
Speaker 4: Us with that, it will give us an idea if we can actually have this or not.
Speaker 6: Yeah, before I just get into that, I think the Blee Nana just unmuted herself in between, do
Speaker 5: You want to add something to it?
Speaker 5: Not as such but I'm very keen to understand more on the ROI part like you know how is that number getting derived like what are the components you're gathering in to provide the ROI because that's something very you know we keep on talking in the organization the Marketing team, serious team keep on talking like you know we need to calculate ROI so I need to understand like you know if you go ahead with the Marketing Cloud water all the components
Speaker 6: It's collecting to provide the ROI. Okay. Perfect, I'll just club the answer for both of your questions. So [PERSON-25], what I wanted to understand was this multi-touch attribution and the account-based reports [ORG-25] on plus.
Agent: Reports, it's present
Speaker 6: Okay, perfect.
Speaker 6: So team, what I wanted to explain to you was that this [ORG-3] solution of our daughter, right, comes in four different versions, right?
Speaker 6: There's growth, there's advance in this premium, right?
Speaker 6: So what we are envisioning here is with the current details that are being shared with you, right?
Speaker 6: We are going to position the plus version to you, because that helps you of the things that [PERSON-25] has showcased [DATE-2].
Speaker 6: Plus, is this second highest version?
Speaker 6: I mean no, sorry. Plus, is the second to the base version. So growth is the base, then this plus then this advance and this premium .
Speaker 6: So in contrary to your sales [PRODUCT-5] module, which is based on user base pricing, which is a per user per month kind of cost annualized, here there is no license fees per say for users, there is no capping on the users.
Speaker 6: It is just the platform fee flat [DATE-18] recurring.
Speaker 4: And you said your contact
Speaker 5: Databases around 7138.
Speaker 5: Right?
Speaker 5: So we are at the beginning of the call . Yes, yeah, somewhere around the 6433.
Speaker 6: No, no, he doesn't have the complete information on this. So we have an account base of
Speaker 5: Nearly almost its 18,000.
Speaker 6: I'm not talking about account base. I'm talking about...
Speaker 6: Contact database, right?
Speaker 6: Like, like, Contact also, it's around that, that much. Yes. Okay. So, the Account Engagement plus version comes with 10,000 contact limitation bundled already in it. You don't have to pay.
Speaker 6: If you want to purchase additional blocks of contacts, then you can buy blocks of 10,000 each, right?
Speaker 6: So, I think 10,000, [PERSON-25], it's my come home, [PRODUCT-6], but may if you want to add, you can add. The ROI part of it is coming from the entire attribution model.
Agent: Manvi, you want to maybe just explain this quickly.
Agent: How the Marketing ROI can be derived?
Agent: Yeah, sure. So, the Marketing ROI, the beauty here is since we are able to marry sales and Marketing data together.
Agent: So, you can actually see that, okay, from your efforts of marketing, let's say certain campaigns that you were running, how much Revenue was generated.
Agent: So, if orders is something that you're tracking for Revenue or the final value that is getting transacted is something that you're tracking as value, that can be used to calculate the ROI. That is one thing.
Agent: Before that, one step before that was to be also sometimes Marketing organizations, they want to know how much opportunity and Pipeline I've given to the business.
Agent: They don't care about the exact conversions, but they ar e more concerned about the [FAC-1] . So if you see, I mean on that campaign dashboard, we are mapping all of that.
Agent: So from a single campaign, what is the [FAC-1] generated?
Agent: And also what is the ROI generated, which is based on transactions and revenue. Both are getting mapped and you can understand the compare and compare that at a campaign level. So multiple parameters, I would say are being tracked.
Agent: You can decide what you want to keep as the priority and what is the secondary part of it that you want to do. use for understanding that how your campaigns are running .
Speaker 5: When it comes to the platform , are giving you revenue-related data as well a s opportunity and pipeline-generated data also .
Speaker 6: Right, so that's
Speaker 5: The, for [PERSON-21], that's the,
Agent: You know, what's coming in, but like, you know, the investment part like. I just want to understand who enters, where it gets entered.
Agent: Please, please, what you're doing is initially, you will be describing a campaign, where you'll be attaching everybody to that particular campaign. Now, that is where you will be describing that how much you're spending on that campaign.
Agent: So if I'm taking an example of [ORG-7], you would have to describe in that particular [ORG-1] campaign that I am putting in so much money for [DATE-9] in [ORG-7].
Agent: And that is how it initially, the creation of the campaign of a campaign is something that marketer would be doing .
Speaker 5: Is being calculated.
Agent: So in sales class. Okay. Yeah. And there's a concept of an architect campaign. I'm not sure if you're using the campaign object on [PRODUCT-1] side, same concept.
Speaker 4: But it's the and marketing,
Agent: So your sales the campaign object is something that did sync automatically.
Speaker 4: So you don't even have to create
Speaker 5: It multiple times. Sales are in marketing. The campaign would be available on both this thing. Okay, and when you talk about or you use the word pipeline,
Agent: Okay, in the Marketing cloud.
Agent: So that means the same opportunities what we are using in the sales cloud, right?
Agent: Like it's nothing different. It's automatically gets captured here as well.
Speaker 6: Yes.
Speaker 6: Yeah, as for the investment, [PERSON-25], the list price for this product is basically quite high.
Speaker 6: Per [DATE-25], but we have an emerging market price that is prevalent in [GPE-4]. So, we can give you very, very high discounts.
Speaker 6: On an annualized basis, this solution would be costing you some every pain [QUANTITY-1] in INR. That's the annualized cost for the solution.
Speaker 5: So this is
Speaker 6: What the growth one used, right?
Speaker 6: This would be... This is plus. This is plus.
Speaker 6: Right, the sales card
Speaker 5: We have a premium license.
Speaker 5: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 5: So what would be the difference between the plus the premium and one?
Speaker 6: Like, you know, what's more than we get. Map don't get confused in the naming of it.
Speaker 6: Right?
Speaker 6: What you can do is you can always upgrade the version at any time, right?
Speaker 6: What I believe in is starting a little bit small with the lowest hanging use cases. Let's address those first, which we showcase [DATE-2].
Speaker 6: But if you want to move the diff, so there are four versions growth plus advance and premium. Premium comes with 71k contacts included in it. It has various [PRODUCT-7] capabilities. There are five sandboxes and all. of that.
Speaker 6: It's more for organizations that do more heavy scale, you know, activities and Marketing Here with the, you know, 9,000 to 25,000 data base, plus is more than enough to help yo u suffice your needs. Right.
Speaker 6: Later on, you have the option of upgrading to advanced and then t o premium.
Speaker 5: That's what I would suggest .
Speaker 5: Are you allowing me to?
Speaker 5: I understand, okay. Yes, yes. I am. And we are actually.
Speaker 6: Yes. Yeah, so rather than, you know, going very heavy and investing a time on a solution that you're using for the first time, start small later at any point of time and you can upgrade it.
Speaker 6: So it's easier also that way as you get to know the product.
Speaker 6: I did not position growth to you because growth is very, very basic, right?
Speaker 6: But I think plus would do a good job for your Marketing team. You will also learn new technologies within the team. So it will be a good positioning.
Speaker 6: But how does the costing sound like to you?
Speaker 6: Is it in line?
Speaker 6: And If we are, I am okay to move quickly to start off this project.
Speaker 5: Well, the question and all we have to have are internal meetings and discuss with the executive chairman as well. But it is on a higher side if I have to be very one.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-24], there is
Speaker 5: And the other thing is that regarding the requirements and all, I do not think that the marketing, they are expecting to have so many elements or components what you have We have the Sales Cloud at least for [DATE-21] now and it's more like an opportunity creation visits, customer visits and order policing and price books and for that part of the thing and which is going very well.
Speaker 6: Shown to us.
Speaker 6: Okay, exactly.
Speaker 5: Yeah. But the marketing, I mean, it doesn't help our Marketing team much with the product, what we already have right now. So that's the reason for coming in touch with you absolutely.
Speaker 6: All again. Like, you know,
Speaker 5: The requirement was mainly from [GPE-5] with the email part, but you know, being the author sales manager, he has to go ahead and, you know, the mailing thing, it's more lucrative In [DATE-25], I would say.
Speaker 6: For us.
Speaker 5: So from my side, as I said, I like it. We need to discuss internally and come back to and rest, so we can share your
Speaker 6: You . Okay
Speaker 6: Feedback.
Speaker 4: Oh and one more
Speaker 6: Thing that maybe I missed out is that there's no capping on the number of emails that you can send out here it's unlimited.
Speaker 5: Right
Speaker 6: Man we mentioned that yes. Okay,
Speaker 4: Yeah. So yes, thank you for answering my question again. So introductory session we will discuss
Speaker 6: This was like an internally with team members. I will get back to you.
Speaker 6: So, can I just have a few last points to address here?
Speaker 6: So, one is that if you're discussing internally with your teams, right, and if you want us to do a demonstration again or maybe just a presentation, we're more than happy to do that because of course, we do [DATE-25] in day out, you're learning There's a lot of information that might get lost in translation, right?
Speaker 4: About the product now.
Speaker 6: So, as a next step, do you want
Speaker 4: That, you know, we meet the larger team and we're going to showcase the same thing to them, take their questions. So that's what initially we'll go and we'll have a discussion with them. We'll give them an overview.
Speaker 4: And then definitely in case
Speaker 6: If you'd like to, I mean if you're interested, we'll definitely have another call with the [PRODUCT-8].
Speaker 6: Okay, what would the decision-making process be here?
Speaker 4: Fair enough. And
Speaker 6: I know that you mentioned the executive chairman would be the final authority, but I'm guessing, [PERSON-6], the [GPE-6], you will first maybe give your sign-off on the solution that yes, you know, this is okay, the Marketing team, larger team.
Speaker 4: Could you just explain to me who all will be involved in this process, the stakeholders?
Speaker 4: For executive chairman, head of marketing, these two people, I think they are involved. They will be involved, will take this proposal, will share that this is what the platform fee and this is what platform can offer.
Speaker 6: And so yeah, I mean executive chairman and head of marketing. Okay, and one last piece, like being in sales, I am very concerned about timeline.
Speaker 6: So I just wanted to understand that, say for example, we have started this discussion now, you talked to your teams and to only say everything goes well, can you foresee a timeline wherein we could maybe,
Speaker 4: You know, come to a conclusion?
Speaker 4: I know it might be a little far-fetched right now, but there could be some clarity on that. So timeline, I don't think so. I have very any clarity there, [PERSON-27].
Speaker 6: Mostly by [DATE-21] when I will get back to you, we will take [DATE-25], go to [DATE-24].
Speaker 4: Okay, so you will take [DATE-27] to get back to me with after discussing with the team or like the final decision.
Speaker 6: After discussing with the team, [DATE-25], one or [DATE-27]. Okay, okay, fair enough. Let me do something I'll share the deck and the proposal with you so that you have some material handy with you.
Speaker 4: And then you know what I'll touch base which you may be towards [DATE-24] to see if
Speaker 6: This is moving forward.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-24] for your time.
Agent: [PERSON-4], do you want to add anything to this?
Agent: No, I think it's
Speaker 4: Pretty much all covered. [PERSON-27] day about it.
Speaker 6: Demo. I think we have used [ORG-33] 9 good to meet you.
Speaker 4: So
Speaker 6: Good to see you. Thank you so much, [PERSON-25]. So we are for your time.
Speaker 5: You appreciate it. Hope this was beneficial And we will stay in touch.
Speaker 6: To you. And I hope you have a great weekend.
Speaker 4: Really?
Speaker 4: Thank you you.
Agent: So much. All of you. Thank
Speaker 4: Thank you.
Speaker 6: And we made a wonderful presentation. Thanks a lot. Thanks, [PERSON-25]. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, [PERSON-33]. Thank you.

	* The customer seemed more engaged as they asked a follow-up question about how the data syncing works.
2. ""So, how does it come and so on . On top of your sales cloud. So if we see from a technical architecture [ORG-2] e, they are seamlessly bidirectionally integrated modules. Your Sales Cloud will be the core or the bottom layer.""
	* The customer seemed more engaged as they asked for clarification about the integration between the Sales Cloud and the Marketing automation platform.
3. ""So, the list price for this product is basically quite high. Per [DATE-25], but we have an emerging market price that is prevalent in [GPE-4]. So, we can give you very, very high discounts. On an annualized basis, this solution would be costing you some every pain [QUANTITY-1] in INR. That's the annualized cost for the solution.""

The customer mentioned an executive chairman and a head of marketing, but it is not explicitly stated if they are the final decision-makers.

The agreed-upon next steps include the seller sharing the deck and proposal with the customer, and following up around [DATE-24] to see if there is progress. The customer will also discuss the platform with their team and get back to the seller by [DATE-27].",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was that they need to discuss it internally and will get back to the seller. They mentioned that the cost is on the higher side, but they liked the product and found it lucrative. They also appreciated the demo and presentation. However, they did not provide a clear timeline for making a decision. Overall, the customer seemed interested but needed more time to consider the proposal.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer expressed that the product, Account Engagement plus version, seems to meet their needs for managing accounts and helping salespersons, as well as measuring campaign effectiveness. However, they need to understand more about the ROI component and the investment required. They also mentioned that their contact database is around 18,000, and the Account Engagement plus version comes with a 10,000 contact limitation bundled. They can purchase additional blocks of 10,000 contacts each if needed.

They also appreciated the unlimited email feature and the ability to marry sales and Marketing data together to see the revenue generated from Marketing efforts. The customer was interested in understanding the ROI calculation and how the Marketing cloud gathers components to provide the ROI.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current use of the existing Sales Cloud platform and how they are utilizing it for lead management. This would have helped the sales rep better tailor the demonstration to the customer's specific use case.

2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current marketing efforts and their goals for using the new platform. This would have helped the sales rep to highlight the features of the Account Engagement module that would be most beneficial to the customer.

3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current process for tracking and managing customer data, and how the new platform would fit into this process. This would have helped the sales rep to demonstrate the data syncing capabilities of the new platform and how it can provide a complete view of the customer for both sales and marketing teams.

4. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current process for creating and sending emails, and how the new platform would fit into this process. This would have helped the sales rep to demonstrate the emailing capabilities of the new platform and how it can help the customer to improve their email deliverability and engagement.

5. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current process for tracking and measuring the ROI of their marketing campaigns. This would have helped the sales rep to demonstrate the analytics and dashboarding capabilities of the new platform and how it can help the customer to better understand the performance of their marketing efforts.

6. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's budget and timeline for implementing a new marketing platform. This would have helped the sales rep to better understand the customer's needs and constraints, and to provide a more accurate proposal.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear evidence of any top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing. The customer did ask about the pricing structure and the ROI calculation, but these do not necessarily indicate concerns that would prevent the deal from closing.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions were aimed at understanding the customer's requirements, their current challenges, and their expectations from the proposed solution. Here are some of the open-ended questions asked by the sales rep:

1. ""Are we in line with your expectations?""
2. ""Are there any questions so far for any of us?""
3. ""What happens to the accounts and the contacts, whatever we have in the present module?""
4. ""What is it that you are looking for in an ideal lead for your business?""
5. ""Do we have any limits on how many emails you can send per day?""
6. ""Do you have any limits on how many emails you can send per day?""
7. ""You mentioned that sales force doesn't allow more than 4200 per day from the system. There's a reason to that because [PRODUCT-1] platform is built for sales teams and sales people, right? It's not built for Marketing mass emailing. That is why that kind of a restriction is there.""
8. ""So how does the costing sound like to you?""
9. ""If we want to move the discussion forward, what would be the next steps?""
10. ""Do you want us to do a demonstration again or maybe just a presentation?""
11. ""So, who all will be involved in this process, the stakeholders?""
12. ""Can you foresee a timeline wherein we could maybe come to a conclusion?""

These questions helped the sales rep to understand the customer's needs, clarify their doubts, and build a rapport with them. It also helped the sales rep to tailor their pitch according to the customer's requirements and expectations."
video_19772_167_6qr3y000000g2OKAAY,"EndUser: I think what's ideal is the output of what we are billing and how we can track that better.
EndUser: A lot of the reporting that we do with our teams, we have to export to [PRODUCT-1] and then kind of do some data entry.
EndUser: So I'd love to see what [ORG-1] might can help us with in terms of reporting for revenue that the team is bringing in.
Speaker 5: Do we have the same process for both functions of the business from a billing perspective?
EndUser: I mean, yeah, pretty much. It's similar. It's [TIME-1] based, but there are some you know, flat fees per month, but yeah, pretty much the same. So We're a [ORG-1] partner
Agent: [PERSON-1], it's a hider here from [FAC-1]. firm. Typically helps companies like you adopt [ORG-1]. So I don't want to steal the thunder from [ORG-1] because [PERSON-2] probably has a great show for you ready.
Agent: But towards the tail end of this call, if we get to it, I would love to understand a little bit more about the relationship between time and invoices.
Agent: I'm guessing you're in Professional services and you have time sheets that are being logged. We're a similar business. So it's a topic that we have solved for ourselves inside [ORG-1].
Agent: And if we don't get to through with [DATE-1], then I can book some time with you and kind of walk you through that. how we do it inside [ORG-1], the entire process from start to end.
EndUser: With
Agent: Quickbooks only just being the bookkeeping financial processing at the tail end of that process.
EndUser: But just Okay.
Agent: Wanted to throw that out there.
EndUser: Thank you. Yeah.
Speaker 8: Thanks for that, Hider. Then with that being said, that's all I wanted to cover.
Speaker 8: [PERSON-2], do you have any comments?
Speaker 8: Otherwise, I can go ahead and turn around the app.
Agent: No, I'll just kind of start demoing [ORG-1] on its baseline, right?
Agent: So what I'll be demoing [DATE-1] is kind of [ORG-1] for its like bread and butter function audio, right?
Agent: So that's being able to track leads, contacts, less outreach, pipeline management, being able to like report on all the above. That being said, what I'm going to be showing is a standard Workflow on [ORG-1].
Agent: As we're going through this, we'd love for you all to be as interactive as possible. Because what I'm going to be showing is baseline functionality.
Agent: And then the reason why we have like, [ORG-2] on this call, the reason why we bring Implementation to partners is because they will actually customize it to be set up as to like what your process is, right?
Agent: So I'm just like walking through what it's like to track a lead on [ORG-1], what it's like to work opportunity, manage pipeline, right?
Agent: If what I'm saying isn't exactly applicable to your business, right?
Agent: The great thing about [ORG-1] is that you customize it as per your business needs.
Agent: Right, so it's just like treat this as like in demonstration kind of for that visual purposes and then let's keep it interactive and be like, hey, actually we would want it to be this way or our process more, you know, follows these workflows right and then we can kind of just like talk about how that functionality can be layered on to salesforce as well.
Agent: Is that all good for everyone?
Agent: Excellent. Let's start sharing this screen over here.
Agent: Okay, so kind of the Workflow that we're going to be doing over here is we're going to be following basically like a lead who can be coming in right just could be an applicant this could be for either streams of your revenue right will go through the all go through like a like I guess elite qualification process prior to actually working opportunities, or would
Speaker 6: You say there's not much like qualification happening kind of anyone who comes in the door is
Agent: Treated as like a sales opportunity. I think the latter is more fair. Yeah, for current situation. Okay. Okay, so we'll skip through the lead qualification piece of it.
Agent: If in the future, you all ever get to the scale where you do need like a dedicated space to like qualify lead and you don't want like maybe hand raisers to be like representing your opportunity pipeline right just know that functionality is there right and it could always be, you know,
Speaker 6: Brought in at a different time when so reach a skill where you could be having like high volumes of
Speaker 5: Of a leads per side. [PERSON-3], would you want to see that with.
Agent: Thinking forward or are you familiar enough that it doesn't matter?
Agent: No, we didn't use it actually. I would like to see it. I don't know what it looks like. Sure. All right, awesome.
Agent: So as we see over here, I'm just going to be starting off on basically the [ORG-1] homepage, right?
Agent: So obviously this is a cloud [PRODUCT-2]. We can access this from our mobile app.
Agent: We can access from any internet browser that we have access to over here, right?
Agent: But we're just going to start off on the homepage and some overall themes to keep in mind with [ORG-1].
Agent: Is that anything that you're seeing from the page layout, the information being displayed over here, is completely customized?
Agent: That's going to be the general theme as we're talking over here, but this is kind of like it adds a baseline representation.
Agent: Okay, so we're already seeing over here on this home stream, we just have a dashboard populated over here.
Agent: Another kind of theme that we wanna keep mine sales horses, any information that you are inputting into the system about your opportunities, your contacts, right?
Agent: Anything like that, we can report on that and we'll dive deeper into our reporting towards the tail end of the demonstration, okay?
Agent: But here I'm just logging into my home screen. I have my dashboard, my metrics, my KPIs. I have my tasks that can be automated out to me.
Agent: So if we talk about Workflow automations, that can be in the form of tasks being generated, emails being sent out to being popped up so people know it's time for them to take action on an opportunity or something.
Speaker 7: Customers, notifications
Agent: I also have my [ORG-3] integrations over here. This is just feeding me all my events for [DATE-1]. For purposes, this is my home screen. I'm logging in.
Agent: I see my reports, my metrics, my tasks, my events, all that just as soon as I'm logging in [ORG-1] .
Agent: Okay, just going to pause here for a quick second.
Agent: Any any questions on what we're seeing?
Agent: Awesome.
Agent: So I'm just going to jump into this first task or this, I guess last task I have over here, which says I need to call this new lead, right?
Agent: So if we decide to use like the lead module on sale source, we can imagine like another example of a Workflow automation, like someone submits a form on your website like a contact platform that generates a lead on [ORG-1].
Agent: Or maybe you have like a CSV file of like all your leads contacts, what have you, we import that in [ORG-1] right and then people can start. People can start working through that pipeline.
Agent: Okay, so I'm gonna jump in on this task over here. I see I'm supposed to call this new lead. Okay, and this is basically the lead module.
Agent: If you're familiar with like working with [ORG-1], right, it looks a lot like the opportunity. But once again, the purpose of this is to, if we can like represent your funnel, this is like that top of the funnel.
Agent: This is like, this could be like someone who just submits a contact us form, right?
Agent: We don't know if there's actually a legitimate opportunity to do business.
Agent: So we use this lead module in order to segregate like unqualified leads from qualified opportunities to do business, right?
Agent: That way like your pipeline is clean. There's not, you know, people.
Agent: You haven't reached out to your presenter in your pipeline And then that way, if you don't qualify a lead you can still keep them as a lead, right And you can still reach out to them so market to them .
Agent: But the purpose of the lead qualification module is just to have that space that like, hey, I'm taking that first call, I'm determining basic information upfront about who this individual is, what kind of business we can do with them.
Agent: It can follow these stages that you're seeing over here, like new, working, qualified, converted. It can obviously be the actual stages that you
Agent: Are these things included in whatever we'll be proposed to or the module separate?
Agent: Yeah, no, this is included. Yeah, I use word module. It's like, you know, in salesforce language, it's what we call an object. Right.
Agent: So objects are like these tabs up front over here, but I find that sometimes, you know, I start using salesforce lingo. People get confused, but yeah, it's included. It's included in just like basic sales. Okay.
Agent: I really like using these stages over here as like... as like a launchpad for like workflows and automations, right?
Agent: Because if you have like stage one, two, three of qualifying lead or working a sales opportunity, right?
Agent: You can have it say like, hey, when you progress from like stage one stage to send this customer this generic email, it's like, hey, we've gone in inquiry.
Agent: Or let's say create tasks for other people to follow up internally, right?
Agent: So a lot that we can talk about in terms like streamlining workflows over here. But really great way to visualize like automations being kicked off and you go. from stage one two two, two two three, et cetera .
Agent: Okay. All the fields over here are same thing. You can build out any field that you want. This would represent the columns on your spreadsheet that you're tracking about your business or your applicant's right.
Agent: And the great thing about [ORG-1] is that we don't limit the ability to report or to build dashboards on any of this data.
Agent: As long as this is information stored within the [PRODUCT-2], we can build out really nice reports, really visually pleasing dashboards that make us so that you don't need to build out a report every single [DATE-2].
Agent: You can just have it being automatically generated. and sent out as well .
Agent: Okay, here on the right-hand tab, right, this is where we track all activity with an individual or contact that we're reaching out with, right?
Agent: So any tasks that could be coming up, any meetings I've been having in the past, any calls that we want to keep call notes on for other people, the reference, or even emails that are being tracked back and forth, right?
Agent: We can literally click on the email of the body here on [ORG-1], right?
Agent: We can get full context as to the history of communication with this individual.
Agent: Right?
Agent: I know looking at [PERSON-4]'s notes, that kind of like activity tracking was big for you.
Agent: Is this kind of like to be able to like, you know, track that sequential history of communication?
Speaker 5: What you were looking for in order
Agent: Or is there something else that we were looking for when it comes for activity history tracking?
Agent: No, this is it. Yeah. So we can either have this, we can set it up in two ways. You can either manually log all emails. So like, you know, I can show that on the email pane.
Agent: You'll have [ORG-1] living in your emails when you click log email, or you can have an automatically log. So, you know, some customers want to manually log. Some customers want to have the entire history automatically tracked as well.
Agent: Okay, that's really, I mean, at its essence, that is what the lead is, right?
Agent: It's a separate space for working this individual compared to the opportunity record.
Agent: And either said the purpose of that is just to kind of segregate on qualified individuals from actually qualified opportunities, right?
Speaker 5: And then that way you just draw that line between kind of, you know, who you're tracking as a sales opportunity
Agent: With a dollar amount versus who's just someone that you're reaching out to and gathering basic information on.
Agent: Will the lead automatically turn into a contact?
Agent: Or can we have that, be the case?
Agent: Ok. Correct.
Agent: So when you click converted over here, you have the opportunity to then push all that information into the main core objects on [ORG-1], right?
Agent: That being the account, if you're working more like B2B case, right?
Agent: And if you're working with a company and you want to represent multiple contacts falling underneath that company, a contact representing that individual Ms. [PERSON-5] reaching out to in a sales opportunity representing the dog.
Agent: Right, so these are probably like the core objects that you're familiar with in your previous [ORG-1] instance. So this is just a step prior to that.
Agent: We can think about these as actual existing customers or people we want to try business with. The lead is just someone who we're just all fine.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Do you think that'd be something helpful to have at this stage or something interesting in the future stage?
Speaker 5: I think the only thing that would be beneficial now, [PERSON-3], tell me what you think is
Speaker 6: If they start to key in stuff on the website.
Speaker 7: Yep. Absolutely. I have a question actually here. So, like, let's say they didn't want a lead qualification process and they just let's say someone filled out a form on the website. Is there any way to automatically
Agent: Become a contact on an account without going through this qualification process?
Agent: Yeah, so some customers forego the lead authentication process and they just go straight to creating contacts accounts opportunities, right?
Agent: So it's different businesses choose different things. Once again, that's the flexibility of sales forces that it's, you know, you
Speaker 8: Choose what you want to do or what you want to build on top of what's already existing.
Agent: Gotcha. Great. Yeah, I just as well.
EndUser: Wanted to make sure that could be automated Yeah.
Agent: It's a good to know.
EndUser: I'm [PERSON-6].
Agent: Can I ask a question?
EndUser: So when [ORG-4] is converted on that
Agent: Page, is there a way to create multiple opportunities?
Agent: From this page over here, you'll just be creating one opportunity that routes to that as well. But then if you want to, you can create multiple different opportunities in the next step that we're going through in the demonstration.
Agent: It's created, okay. Yeah, absolutely. And, um, I apologize.
Agent: Can you also remind me real quick, what are those two different streams of revenue, uh, that we are tracking over here?
Agent: I know that you have your applicants coming in, but what is like, what is the other line of just want to remind, uh, reminding me real quick.
Speaker 5: Business if, if you
Agent: Consulting consulting. Okay. So consulting will be with like existing, yeah, with like existing on sales.
Speaker 5: Accounts that you have
Agent: So let's just go to, or be not.
Speaker 7: I mean, it could also
Agent: Yeah, you could also do that new business as well.
Agent: Let's just go to the account page right now because the accounts will represent any sort of customers that we're working with who potentially could have multiple contacts, right?
Agent: They're representing a company that we're working with, right?
Agent: So same thing with leads with any of these tabs over here. We can create any list view that filters through that. filters through any of these objects over here.
Agent: If you want to segment your accounts by what kind of business they are, is this an applicant, is this a consultant, and you want to create different list views, then you can just very easily get quick snapshots into different segmentations of your account.
Agent: You can do that over here. So these are just like my recently viewed. I can create any list view that I want over here,
Speaker 5: And then I can just edit the filter so that when I look at this list, I can very quickly see whichever accounts, opportunities, leads, fall in any of these views.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-1], from the sales perspective, I don't, there would be no value in separating them because to me, they're just a business
EndUser: And we can go sell them either. But for you from a billing or from a Integration
Speaker 5: With QuickBooks perspective, you would want us to separate, I imagine, right?
Speaker 5: Separate the accounts. Like if it were. So the accounts
Agent: Are just going to represent the business.
Agent: I think that's silly, but I know that it's very By the time it gets to important for you.
EndUser: Quickbooks to be separate from a revenue perspective, I would imagine and from a billing perspective. There's, I'm sure there's a way but I don't think there needs to be an account.
Agent: To do it differently, about when I was asking about
EndUser: Like when I was thinking the opportunities
Speaker 6: Is tracking the opportunities separately. Like this is for consulting and this is for recording. Yeah.
EndUser: It's like our service lines
Agent: Now, [PERSON-1]. I would think we would want it to be one account and then just break out the service lines underneath it. because that's how it feels . That's how it looks in QuickBooks.
Agent: Yeah, so we can absolutely do that. I'll touch on that right now, but as you said, you're gonna have one customer who you have multiple different opportunities with.
Agent: I mean, it makes sense why you're asking that question now, [PERSON-1].
Agent: So let's go into that, right?
Agent: This account, right?
Agent: It just represents the customer that we're working with.
Agent: We'll see over here that this basically will not just contain all the basic details about that company that we're working with, right?
Agent: So just general accounting information, where this location's located, right?
Agent: Any details we wanna talk about the customer, and it's very similar like user interface, right?
Agent: Right, here's all the details , all the different tabs so we can like relat e to other objects . then here's all the activity that we're [PERSON-7] on the account .
Agent: So any emails going back and forth to the customer, etc.
Agent: Did everyone else lose [PERSON-2]?
Agent: We did, yeah. Oh, he's back, I think.
Speaker 5: Or he's coming back.
Speaker 7: He's the best hider.
Agent: Let me.
Speaker 7: Okay, my back. We can hear you now.
Agent: Okay, cancel on my VPN and just below this.
Agent: Right, so just think about the account as the umbrella for anything about your customer.
Agent: Do you all ever work with like, um, like parent child account relationships where you can have like a top level account and then have different branches or that's not that's not well.
Speaker 5: The trail.
Speaker 6: Yeah, but the only time we've had that is when we're working with private equity and then we've had parent with child accounts, but it's not common and we could have separate ones. That would be fine too.
Agent: Okay, so if you do have any customers and I'm really choppy, I know you all are really sorry, but if you do have any customers that you're working parent child accountability services with, right, we can also create account hierarchies where you can have like, you know, the top level account and then have like child or child accounts rolling up underneath it.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Now the big piece about this right, as I said, this is the umbrella for the customer, right?
Agent: So any contacts that roll up to that account are easily accessible over here.
Agent: Every contact also has their own contact object, right?
Agent: Where if you want to store any basic information about that specific individual you can. And then this tab over here, the sales tab, right, is where we can have multiple opportunities that roll up underneath that account.
Agent: Right, so any past sales opportunity that we worked with will be accessible here. If anyone wants like access notes from past opportunities, all current sales opportunities.
Agent: And then [PERSON-8], if you ever want to create a new sales opportunity, you can just like literally go to the account, click new over here.
Agent: And then I think this will also be a big piece, right?
Agent: So when I clicked create new opportunity, you'll see there's like two different opportunity record types.
Agent: These can represent your two different lines of business, right?
Agent: This makes it so that when I create an opportunity, I can have like a specific project.
Agent: Tracking of like your revenue stream A where it can have, let's say, stages one through [ORG-5] e of working it versus if it's just like an applican t coming in, maybe it's only a three-stage sales process, right ?
Agent: So this is how we can control the different sales processes, different lines, revenues, multiple types of opportunities, and have them rolling up to one account, one customer. Okay. So I can create an opportunity over here.
Agent: Something I'm going to create when these simple project opportunities, so that's going to show you the difference of how these look over here. So let me fill out this basic information.
Agent: Let me create this opportunity. Okay, so let me just wanna show you right.
Agent: So we talked about how these can represent two different opportunity types, right?
Agent: Two different lines of business. So I just created this test opportunity over here. Let me open up this opportunity as well. So you'll see right for this sales opportunity opened, there is a five step sales process.
Agent: This could represent revenue stream A. Whereas this other opportunity I opened, it's just for demonstration purposes, it has like a one step sales process.
Agent: So I can have, for these two different types of revenue streams, I can have different information that I track for this type, versus different information that I track for the other type of revenue.
Agent: And then you can report across your two revenue streams, have them connected to your accounts, your contacts, et cetera. Okay. Do you all think this would kind of like be helpful in terms of
Speaker 7: Those multiple opportunities and being able to track them independently?
Speaker 7: Yes. Hey, [PERSON-2]. You might be going
Agent: Over this in a second,
Speaker 8: But we'd love to show a little bit of the chatter functionality, because I know that we're going to be passing off
Agent: A lot of times with two streams of revenue between two different reps. So if you could display that, I think that would be helpful as well. Awesome. Yeah, I'll get into that, [PERSON-4]. We're really right.
Agent: This is now the opportunity. You'll realize once again, once you get the interface of the other objects on [ORG-1], like the lead DA count rate, it's a very similar UI. It's a very similar idea.
Agent: It's just different objects to track different processes on [ORG-1]. This is actually representing the dollar amount. This is a sales opportunity for $[MONEY-1].
Agent: This is where we can actually create that pipeline with different stages, where we can track where we can track where we're bottlenecking.
Agent: Where are we being held up in specific stages Like is in stage one where maybe we're spendin g you way too much time on that initial stage, are we being held up throughout the process?
Agent: This is also very important for forecasting. So being able two forecast when deals will be coming in, being able to assign at its simplest stage probability.
Agent: Like when we're at stage one, maybe there's [PERCENT-1] chance to close, whereas stage five, [PERCENT-2] chance to close, for example. Very similar ideas, very similar themes. This is where we're just tracking all information about the opportunity itself.
Agent: Activities, tasks, calls that relate to the opportunity in itself as well. And this is where even at [ORG-1] case he and I spend most of our time.
Agent: This is where we update our next steps for our managers to see this is where I update my comments as a solution engineer on our deals and stuff.
Agent: So this is where everyone focuses on in terms of understanding how that deal is progressing.
Agent: Okay, as [PERSON-4] mentioned, right?
Agent: I can have this little chatter right in chatters for basically like internal sales force communication, right?
Agent: So this is like if anyone wants to share updates or they want to like at mention someone and be like, Hey, what's going on with this deal?
Agent: You haven't updated it in [DATE-3].
Agent: Have you reached out to this concept, right?
Agent: I can just share updates over here.
Agent: I can like, you know, I can do at mentions, right?
Agent: And then that person will get like a ping on their, you know, a ping on their sales force, letting them know that they have. been reached out to.
Agent: This is like what we, this is like when we get in trouble in [ORG-1] and we have an update our next steps and us and let us know that we need to update something.
Speaker 7: Our manager wants at mentioned
Agent: The worst notification. But They usually don't share good news on it.
Speaker 8: Yeah.
Agent: It's usually just bad news. Right. But here's you know that internal collaboration tool over here. Is there anyone can go into like it comment on it updated and so on.
Agent: Something I didn't mention as well is that you can also do a lot of activity from here.
Agent: So from the lead page, account page, opportunity page, I can email my customer, right?
Agent: I can leverage like email templates that use like merge fields. So I don't need to like, re-send the same email over and over again. These can also be automated emails at leverage templates.
Agent: Like maybe like, you know, when you go from stage one two stage two, we want to provide like a summary to the customer and just email it out to them.
Agent: Once you get examples of like automations, workflows that you all can work out in terms of how you actually want to. implement it.
Agent: I can like create meetings out of here directly as well. I can create tasks for people to follow up with.
Agent: I can leave call notes as well, right?
Agent: So this is just that one stop shop for all communication. Also just directly out of sales versus well, since it'll integrate with your either HTML or Outlook.
Agent: Something I'm actually gonna stop presenting my screen of your, because I wanna pull up my email. I wanna show you all how this also looks like on the email pane. So as I'm doing that.
Agent: What are some of your, what are some of your thoughts?
Agent: I mean, what I'm showing you here is like kind of like very baseline sales works, right?
Agent: This is like very minimal customization.
Agent: How do like how do you all think this would fit into your business?
Agent: And then more importantly, if it doesn't fit, how can we maybe tweak some of these processes or anything to make it actually fit for, for what I'll need.
Agent: To automate versus
Speaker 5: What we're doing now. I have a question. Thinking about I know that you guys can upload data from another system. I want to see what it looks like knowing that like if we placed someone somewhere.
Speaker [DATE-4], [DATE-5], [DATE-6], what that would look like within our system, knowing that we'd recruits here, I guess.
Agent: Be pulling it from
Speaker 5: But we would want to be able to see who used us for what and knowing that majority of that group would have used us in a way where we placed
Agent: A person, like we'd want
Agent: Whatever.
Speaker 5: Yeah, I
Agent: Would say that to yeah.
Agent: I think that would be more of an Implementation detail because if you bring the data, I mean, depending on the sync that we do with recruit [PRODUCT-2], you would bring in your placements historical data.
Agent: And ideally, that would then show up so that you can see that, okay, you can search in [ORG-1] to say, okay, this person, we place them here and here in the past.
Agent: If I think that's what you're asking about, that when you're looking at a candidate's profile in [ORG-1], you also want to see their placement history or vice versa if you're looking at a company's profile in [ORG-1].
Agent: You want to see all the placements that were Yes, they're lattered, definitely.
Speaker 5: Delivered there.
Agent: Yes. So that would depend on how you bring the placements data in and how successfully you're able to match it up to the different companies and stuff, which gets into the piece.
Speaker 5: [ORG-6] CRM Integration Okay.
Agent: So I don't know if it's probably not possible from a <inaudible> demo, but I think I can <inaudible> understand what you're looking for.
Agent: A lot of that migration data prep part is on the Implementation side of the house, but maybe if you want to dive deeper on it, if you all need any technical validation on it after we talk about it, happy to provide them.
Speaker 8: One thing I want to jump in with here is while in regards to maybe timeline, so would you like recruit [PRODUCT-2] to be implemented from the start, or is that something that's more down the road?
Speaker 8: Nice to have.
Speaker 6: I think recruit [PRODUCT-2] is already
Agent: In place. You mean
Speaker 8: Connected?
Speaker 8: Oh, the connection connection. Yes. Yeah, so I put it in the [ORG-1]. Sorry.
Speaker 6: Yeah, maybe I can use the correct technology there. I would say we'd want it right away. I would think that would be one of our biggest data points.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-3], [PERSON-1], do you all feel differently?
EndUser: No, I mean, I I just know that the applicant tracking system when recruits [PRODUCT-2] is so valuable
Speaker 8: To what they're currently doing.
Agent: Yeah. Absolutely. So I would say that, you know, from a project Implementation standpoint, if you decide to proceed with us, what we would recommend is a bit of a phased approach.
Agent: It doesn't have to be like far apart in time. But let's start getting you on board with [ORG-1] and starting to use the pipeline tracking and all of that.
Agent: And then, you know, as a recruit [PRODUCT-3] happens because it might take a little bit longer than the actual [ORG-1] implementation.
Agent: That data would just kind of stream in [DATE-7] so that you can start seeing more enhanced data in [ORG-1], but to. That would be my [MONEY-2].
Agent: Yeah, it's usually I mean we can we can do all in one implementations. We get customers who are like, yeah, absolutely. This is all phase one. Sometimes also it's we recommend phasing all the implementation.
Agent: If like you get a lot of value from kind of a low lift Implementation initially like just implementing [ORG-1] as we're sitting here right now, we'll recommend that and then maybe face to is bringing in recruit [PRODUCT-2] right but there's options there basically.
Agent: And that's, you know, to be having to get into the Implementation discussions.
Agent: But as I said, right, I just want to show really quickly how this also plays onto your email pane because a lot of customers also work primarily off of email.
Agent: So this is bringing [ORG-1] to life, right?
Agent: As soon as I open up an email from [PERSON-9]. It pulls up [PERSON-10] account record.
Agent: It pulls up any sales opportunity that she's tied with, right?
Agent: Anything that we want to bring in from [ORG-1], so I can just click into her account. I can get contacts. I can get their website really quickly.
Agent: I don't open up [ORG-1], reach out, find out who this individual is, right?
Agent: So we got email Integration on the [ORG-1] side.
Agent: And then on your email side as well, right?
Agent: You can get full [PRODUCT-2] contacts when you're actually working out of your email as well. You can even just edit these records directly on your email as well.
Agent: So you also don't need to go into [ORG-1] to update [ORG-7]'s information.
Agent: Something I will switch to like showing over here as well is if you're also, if you ever have any scheduling issues as well, you want to be able to just like, I know the case he scheduled with you all this way, but being able to like pull up your team's calendar drop times that you guys are available and then let your customer select when they're available to meet with you, or just send them your entire calendar as well.
Agent: It can just make scheduling a whole lot easier on that sense.
Agent: Okay, going back really that has so we covered everything from like lead management account management opportunity pipeline management have different opportunity record types to track different sales processes, etc.
Agent: The last thing I'll just show over here is like the reporting and dashboards right. So as I said with [ORG-1] you can report on any information that is stored within the [PRODUCT-2] right.
Agent: So any information that you are tracking while my internet's really slow [DATE-1].
Agent: Any information that you're tracking within the [PRODUCT-2] or any information that's even being pushed over from let's say quick books or any other Integration right as long as that information is living within [ORG-1] right we can build out reports we can build out dashboards to track all the above.
Agent: So here's like an example of like a sales executive dashboard being able to track basic like KPIs that you know most everyone is interested about like closed business.
Agent: Pipeline broken up into stages, tracking different reps and how they're performing in terms of like activities, calls, pipeline,
EndUser: Closed business by rep as well, right?
EndUser: Anything that we want to track over here, we can on [ORG-1].
Agent: And are those dashboards customizable by user?
Agent: So like the different team members could have the different reports for their closed business for [DATE-8]. Yeah, exactly. So we can set up these reports.
Agent: Like sometimes, like on our side, like we have it reports dashboards for the entire
Agent: Team, whereas we have other reports and dashboards that filter for like when you view it as [PERSON-2], let me see my metrics instead of like my entire teams metrics.
Agent: So you can set it up so that each user sees only their own kind of view or perspective.
EndUser: You can also set it up if I'm a manager, I want to
Agent: So that you can filter it. So see my entire team, and then I want to hone in on one person, so I can just filter for them as well. Multiple ways to achieve that. Yeah. I have an example.
Agent: Yeah, sorry. Now you go ahead. I was going to say like I have an example of one of those top level filters over here.
Agent: This is just I had one customer who wanted to filter by created date as well.
EndUser: But I can just do a top level filter on the entire dashboard by rep for example.
EndUser: And then it would update the entire dashboard to filter by, you know, what you want to filter with on the top of the dashboard. Okay.
EndUser: And then [ORG-1], I'm just trying to think that historically, you know, it's like where the data is coming from in terms of, We have the opportunity the business is closed.
EndUser: If an employee gets a commission based on that, there's no calculation that's being done within [ORG-1].
Agent: That would be something that we'd have to export
Agent: And then run it calculation.
Agent: I've done this in the past, but there's no calculation element, correct?
Agent: So, hi, do you want to take it?
Agent: No, go ahead. I was just itching to. So [PERSON-1], we actually do all of that in [ORG-1] as a customer. So we have set up formulas and a couple of things.
Agent: So a sales compensation model where often opportunity, there could be multiple tiers of commissions, there could be multiple compensation structures depending on the product, service, whatnot. But then we do all that calculation on the opportunity.
Agent: And we calculate the numbers, and then we run our sales compensation dashboards off of that.
Agent: Because for us, it's also about until the project has been delivered, when we receive them the funds, that's when we pay out the commissions rate. So it's kind of like there's a time lag.
Agent: So it's very important for us to give that visibility to our salespeople that look.
Agent: I mean, here's what you have closed or booked, how much of that has been delivered, which you have been paid out on, how much of
EndUser: It is still remaining in the pipeline of receivables,
Agent: I can show that to you as well whenever we get a chance. But you don't have to take it. In fact, I did a webinar [DATE-9], and I think the rest of the team knows about that.
Agent: You don't have to take this data out into a spreadsheet and process separately somewhere. There are third party apps also available that manage a way more complex sales compensation, like [ORG-1]'s own compensation.
Agent: It is managed inside a dedicated app, which also is integrated into [ORG-1]. But like I find that sales compensation models do not ask complex in companies or... sizes as they are for something like [ORG-1] So
EndUser: Depending on your needs,
EndUser: This can be accomplished within [ORG-8]: Are possible computations are possible custom reporting is possible . Okay, great. Thank you. Absolutely.
Agent: Yeah, that's to do with kind of like the theme that we mentioned earlier is that we can report on anything on [ORG-1] right?
Agent: So if you want to create like custom formula fields that are calculating based off of opportunity flows, who's tapped to all that, you want to generate reports out of it, right?
Agent: Those are like, you know, that's an example of using custom fields formulas, all that. So absolutely possible over here.
Agent: Right, so these are just our compilation report, but it's actually going to like what it's like to build out one of these reports, or actually like extract data from [ORG-1] as well.
Agent: Right, so here's our pipeline broken up into the different stages of the opportunity that we have, right?
Agent: So you imagine like for your dashboard, you can have a pipeline representing revenue source A versus a pipeline representing revenue source B, right?
Agent: Here's basically all of that information, all of our opportunities broken up into those different stages of the opportunity that we have over here.
Agent: If I want to make edits on this report, just to show you all how easy this is to pull data and manipulate it here on [ORG-1]. As long as it's living in [ORG-1], I can pull it in.
Agent: If I want to add another column, maybe I want to do.
Agent: Account type over here, right?
Agent: Or maybe this could be like opportunity type for revenue source A versus revenue source B, right?
Agent: I just added that column. Let's say right now this report is segmented by the stage of the opportunity. Let's say I want to segmented by stage and account type.
Agent: I can just group it also by account type as well, right?
Agent: And then I can very quickly just get that updated report. Let me change this into like a stacked bar graph so we can see both levels.
Agent: And then if I want to do any filters as well, let's say I only want to show opportunities from, you know, sort of all time, let's say I want to see it from [DATE-10] or something, right?
Agent: So very easy to like add, you know, to create these reports to manipulate the data, segment it, filter through it.
Agent: And then once you build out these reports, right?
Agent: These live on your dashboard.
Agent: You just click refresh on your dashboard and it pulls up all the updated reports, right?
Agent: Right at once. If you want to take this report, let me just close this.
Agent: If I want to take this report and I want to export it to a CSV or something, right?
Agent: I can also do that. If I want to schedule to send me that CSV [DATE-13], other examples of opportunities.
Agent: If I want to email this entire dashboard to our CEO at every single cadence, right?
Agent: Other examples of just how you can automate the reporting process of this.
Agent: Right, so exploring this is just simple.
Agent: It is going on the report, clean export, give it to me in a CSV, [ORG-9] format, right?
Agent: And then I can take that data and I can manipulate it and excel if I need it to. Or you can do that manipulation in [ORG-1] if you're familiar with it.
Agent: Any final questions on reports, dashboards, analytics?
Agent: Awesome. So as I said, right, this was like a very kind of like standard sales source demonstration over here. It wraps up kind of what I had prepared for [DATE-1].
Agent: I think with [TIME-2] it would be helpful to kind of like complete the latter half of the picture, that being the billing invoicing piece of this.
Agent: So if there's no other questions on basic [PRODUCT-2], I would like to pivot to that.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So is it okay if I just take [TIME-3] [PERSON-1] and I'll walk you through. So this is really our own [PRODUCT-2]. It's not a demo instance. But it's basically showing you how we use [ORG-1].
Agent: And I think we're pretty similar to you in the sense that we have two sites to our business. One is software products built on the [ORG-1] platform. and that's like a, we're a software service SaaS company there.
Agent: And the other one is Professional services delivering projects to companies like you. So I'll just quickly outline that. So here is a customer account, for example, on the top you can see our [ORG-1] built out.
Agent: So we have your accounts and opportunities, just like you or anyone else. And then we've built out a couple of things. So we've got our project management tool in here, [FAC-1] projects. We've got our tickets.
Agent: We've got our invoices. and our time sheet entry. So I'm just going to try to like quickly covers this ground in like [TIME-4]. So here we have our opportunities, opportunities turned into quotes.
Agent: Those quotes will turn into either a services contract or an apps subscription. So that is over here. So these are services contracts and then the, sorry, the contracts are for the subscriptions.
Agent: And then these are the projects that come out of it, right?
Agent: So then whatever projects we're delivering, we would do that. I'm not going to the details of that. And then our invoices show up over here as well.
Agent: So on one place where I can see everything, I can see my projects, opportunities, quotes, contracts, subscriptions, all of that. On the project, we have time sheets that are aggregated.
Agent: So we built out a slightly customized interface here in [ORG-1] for our time sheets. So this allows like spreadsheet style, very quick time sheet entry. We do [DATE-15] time sheets, so we select the time.
Agent: And then we can go ahead and add like multiple tasks from multiple projects. So you can see I've got a project, Alt-O-West Capital, I've got one for [ORG-10].
Agent: And I can log in my, if I've worked on different projects for [DATE-20], this seems like a long day here, I can just log [TIME-5].
Agent: And then we have the ability to complete this task status right from here. So I can mark my task as completed. and I can choose the skill type.
Agent: So we have got three main skill types admin consultant architect, which automatically inherits the rates from that client's account on an [TIME-6] basis. So once I hit save and submit, a couple of things happen.
Agent: Time sheets are routed for approvals to the managers who approve them or review them. And then the records are created in the background.
Agent: So the time sheet, how much time you spent, which skill type it was, what was the [TIME-6] rate for this customer for that skill type?
Agent: All of that is now stored in the [PRODUCT-2]. The output of that, what we do is we basically create, so this is our invoicing module, which we also have as an app.
Agent: Call it Payment's Junction, sorry for the cheesy naming, but that's what it made the most sense to us. So with Payment's Junction, we basically run our entire invoicing flow in [ORG-1], and I'll dive into it.
Agent: So here is an invoiced record. You can see the invoiced line items are the total admin hours logged, total consultant [TIME-7] logged. So that's the time sheet output which is turned into the invoiced, you know, billable line items.
Agent: And all the calculations are done.
Agent: If taxes are applicable for us, we're a [NORP-1] company so we don't collect taxes in the [GPE-1] but if it was a [NORP-1] customer then I would see tax line items there as well.
Agent: So, That would be automatically computed too. And then we have, so here's what the invoice looks like. Oh, sorry, this is what the invoice looks like.
Agent: And then we capture everything, right?
Agent: The last successful payment date, how what's the invoice aging like and things like that.
Agent: What account, what billing contact does it connect to?
Agent: And so on so all of that here financial details amounts numbers formula fields blah so this is this process is automated so the big thing for us the big news for us is that it used to take us [TIME-8] a month to do the invoicing we have reduced that time down to I think two so pretty much safe like half a week of someone's time and really the way it works is that At [DATE-20], someone pushes a button.
Agent: All the time sheets logged against all the projects for all the customers are automatically calculated. And the invoice record that you're looking at is automatically created.
Agent: This invoice record can also be, I mean, it's automatically generated into a PDF document. So here you can see here's invoices delivered for [DATE-18] to this client. Here's a total, this, that, the other.
Agent: Here's the banking instructions for payment and boom.
Agent: Then we do still do a little bit of a human review and then we hit a button and all these invoices are automatically emailed out to the customers with a payment link, a personalized payment link generated per invoice.
Agent: So they can go in and they can click on that payment link, which will take them to our portal collaboration junction. And here they can, I mean, they can also view their projects.
Agent: This portal is also on [ORG-1] rates. This is our client portal. And they can come in, they can review their projects, tickets, all of that stuff, the billing summary.
Agent: But mainly they can see the invoice and they can view it or they can pay it. If they click on Pay Now, it takes them to that personalized payment page where you can see this is the invoice number.
Agent: This is the billing contact. Here is the amount and then they can enter the credit card and submit the payment. That payment information is captured right back here in the payment transaction.
Agent: So we can see that, OK, this payment came in automatically. Obviously, if we do three types of payments. So one is you can enter the credit card details and pay.
Agent: For certain types of services, we have a pre-authorized credit card stored on file with our Stripe integration. So we automatically charge the credit card and just send them a receipt.
Agent: And then the third way is obviously the good old-fashioned check, which comes into the bank and becomes the pain, because then it has to be reconciled. But we still do that. So that's that.
Agent: Then from a reporting perspective, I can see all of that on my invoices dashboard. So I can see, well, this one needs a little bit of refresh.
Agent: So what's my invoicing pipeline?
Agent: What has been sent?
Agent: What has been paid?
Agent: What is not paid?
Agent: What's invoicing aging?
Agent: I can see all of that here. I can see what taxes I have collected [DATE-18], [DATE-20].
Agent: What do I have to remit to?
Agent: [PERSON-13] in your case, the, you know, [ORG-13]. And so all of that. And my cash flow trends, this is all [ORG-15]. Closely related to this is the sales compensation dashboard that I was talking about.
Agent: So I can, as a salesperson, we can see, here's what I've booked [DATE-20]. and what categories, so we have different compensation categories for different products, different service plans, and so on.
Agent: Then what has been paid and what remains.
Agent: This is their [ORG-20] and Solution dashboard where they can look at this dashboard and they can look at their bank statement and that should completely coincide in terms of what they got paid.
Agent: This is all fully, obviously automated as well. And, and, And then the time sheets show up in our metrics dashboard.
Agent: So this is where we as a team, as a project management team, we track who are the most productive resources right now from their time sheets. We also look at estimation accuracy.
Agent: So if we estimated that this project would take us [TIME-9], and the time sheets, the billable time that we log was [TIME-10], well, how many times did we go over?
Agent: How many times were we under?
Agent: So that helps us. improve our estimation accuracy We can look at resource utilization So this is all derived from the time sheet s that people are logging on a day-to-day .
EndUser: I think that is what I wanted to show you. So I'll stop here and Thank you.
Agent: Open it up to you for your questions.
EndUser: That's great. A lot of the reporting that you just showed there like utilization is a lot that we do manual right now.
EndUser: I can see where this could be really useful for, salary people, but the one question I have, we do have some [TIME-6] staff that we actually use the time that they enter in QuickBooks time for especially our
Agent: Payroll.
Agent: Do you, does this track for payroll purposes or anything?
EndUser: Or export for payroll
Agent: How do you all handle it?
Agent: Everybody on salary?
Agent: At your firm?
Agent: For us, we don't have contractors, so we don't have to do with that. But the idea is that, I mean, you can integrate with QuickBooks. So we just implemented our QuickBooks online as well.
Agent: And sadly, I still haven't fully activated it. So we're kind of going through that motion. So I'm running two accounting systems in parallel, which on its own.
EndUser: Is... a nightmare I'm right there with you right now.
Agent: Hey, So you know what I'm talking about?
Agent: Yeah, let's join up for group therapy. Yeah. But essentially, we have an app. which is called connect junction. So it connects [ORG-1] to QuickBooks, and then you can kind of create mappings and you can exchange data both ways.
Agent: So in this case, in our case, we are doing invoices in [ORG-1], we're tracking payments in [ORG-1] as well. And then at the end of it, we just take the invoice and the payment record to [ORG-20].
Agent: And it's just a bookkeeping, uh, Hey, line of the process that would now happen in QuickBooks, right?
Agent: For you, uh, it depends. I mean, you could, you could have them log their time in QuickBooks time if you want.
Agent: Continue doing it that way, or you can also use timesheet junction, which is our app built on [ORG-1], and you can have them log their time in [ORG-1].
Agent: For salaried and contracted people, there's different license types available from [ORG-1].
Agent: You wouldn't want a full [ORG-1] license for an [TIME-6] rate contractor, so they can come in through a contractor interface or a contractor portal, so to speak, provided by [ORG-1]. They can log their time.
Agent: All the time can come aggregated. You can run your invoicing process. And then it's up to you whether you choose, I mean, you can even collect payments.
Agent: And then really all you are taking to QuickBooks at [DATE-21] is the details of the payroll.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Who gets paid what?
Agent: So once you have all that report generated, then you can just take the output of that report to QuickBooks through the Integration and run your payroll in [ORG-20]. So in theory, it is possible to automate the full process.
Agent: The benefit of keeping everything in salesforce obviously is that, I mean, if you wanted to expose time sheets to your clients, we do that. So our clients can come in, they can audit our time sheets.
Agent: Once they have been reviewed by a project manager, they can audit the time sheets on a [DATE-18] basis. You can obviously see everything linked to one system.
Agent: Here's my time, here's what the client has paid, here's the invoices, here's the payment status. All that visibility comes into one system.
Agent: The same reports and dashboards that you use for your pipeline can now be used for your invoices, can be used for your time sheets as you saw.
Agent: So for us, we like that because we're not fragmenting our process, right?
Agent: We're not using [ORG-18] for timesheets, QuickBooks for this, that, the other. We just use QuickBooks for the bare minimum payroll and bookkeeping. But everything else from a customer interaction standpoint happens inside [ORG-1].
Agent: And I'm working with a couple of other companies. We're working with one company called [ORG-20]. They do, they're out of [GPE-2] as well, I believe. And they do
Agent: Trainings. So we're basically giving them a time sheet and an expense reporting module as well in [ORG-1].
Agent: So their instructors can travel around the country, fill out their time sheets, fill out their expenses, upload their receipts, all in [ORG-1]. And then at the end of it, we will take that information from there to QuickBooks.
Agent: I think they're using QuickBooks to stop. or they might be upgrading to QuickBooks Online now. But yeah, that's the idea that all of that output will then go into QuickBooks. We're also talking to [ORG-10].
Agent: We've actually done a lot of project for them, but the vision there is the same. They're actually using a QuickBooks replacement called [ORG-20] on [ORG-1]. So their accounting also lives inside the same interface that you're looking at.
Agent: Then it's just one window show, right?
Agent: It's just like... Log your time sheets, do your invoicing, and the ledger also resides in [ORG-1]. That's like a complete one-stop solution.
Agent: So I know we're at [DATE-20], but if there's an interest in learning more, [PERSON-1], I would be happy to discuss more.
Agent: What you have seen is a combination of a couple of apps that we provide. So connect Junction for connecting to QuickBooks, time sheet Junction for logging at time sheets, payment Junction for generating invoices and stuff.
Agent: So we've tried to modularize it because not everyone needs everything. So we are trying to like, you know, just not have one size fits all.
Agent: And then what you have seen is a little bit of a custom customization, which is not available as an app. because sales compensation is different for every company. So there's really not much point in productizing it.
Agent: That part is always almost custom delivered per customer requirements. So those are the four components that we have implemented more than happy to kind of for ourselves as well.
EndUser: And we'd be do that for you as well. Awesome, that's helpful. All right.
EndUser: Can I ask one question before we hop off?
EndUser: So you guys might have talked about this last time when I was not on the call, but I understand HIDR that you're an Implementation partner.
EndUser: So if we were to move forward, you know, as [PERSON-3] said, both gents, we have nothing now. Our recruiting team is using recruit [PRODUCT-2]. I'm not sure that they fully, the whole team has fully adopted it.
EndUser: The system is only good as the data that's input. People are using it.
EndUser: What type of training comes Do with?
Agent: Just does the implement?
Agent: Does your group offer some training and helping our people adopt it?
Agent: Yes, OK. We that's a big part of what we do. We actually have a plan just for customers looking to improve adoption.
Agent: Obviously, when we deliver the project, we deliver training, we deliver end user training, admin training, orientation, all of that, right?
Agent: Because we. Our promise is to not just deliver the keys to you, but also teach you how to take the car to your first grocery run. So that's what we do.
Agent: But we also have a plan called on staff plan, which is which is a lot of our end of like, it's basically services as a subscription.
Agent: So at times customers are like, okay, we have delivered that, you know, 10, project now. But what if I need like one dashboard tweak, I have [TIME-13] of work to be done.
Agent: And where do I go for that?
Agent: So for that, we have a plan where you can kind of rent a salesforce brain from us by [TIME-15] and you could have us do like a hours customization, you could have us do like [TIME-20] customization and we invoice you [DATE-18] for that.
Agent: That was an invoicing process that you saw the automated invoicing. That's exactly it. So whatever task you submit, that becomes a ticket. We pick up that ticket, deliver it, and then do that.
Agent: So as part of that on stuff plan, it's not always technical tasks that we're delivering. At times it's adoption assistance.
Agent: Hey, like, you know, let's, I want to meet and talk about what else we can do to like incentivize adoption and sales force. Or I need some training.
Agent: I have a couple of new users starting and I need an orientation session for them.
Agent: Can you deliver a [TIME-20] orientation for them?
Agent: So it's really, we have, we have you covered basically from everything, implementation, integration,
EndUser: And training. Okay, great. Thank you.
Agent: Awesome. Thanks for that, Hider.
Agent: Sorry I had to give up that meeting room, but I guess one thing I'll go ahead and leave it off to is there anything here that we didn't cover or anything you'd like to know more from
Speaker 5: This demonstration. Not for
Agent: My end. Okay, cool. No, that was helpful. Thank you. Yeah, of course. And thanks for the hider. That's that was a great presentation. I actually myself didn't know that existed.
Agent: So it's one of the great things about [ORG-1] is you learn something new every day. So I appreciate that. Okay.
Agent: And then as far as kind of next steps here, I do have a few questions before we hop off.
Agent: First and foremost, I know that I mentioned this earlier, do you guys have a budget allocated for this project?
Agent: And what would that number be?
EndUser: We don't. But I had a placeholder that budgets were due [DATE-1].
Agent: So I've been yet.
Speaker 6: Seeing anything come through Okay.
EndUser: Don't hold your breath [PERSON-1].
Agent: So I just like wanted to test the waters a little bit. I understand you're looking for 10 licenses. Giving your needs, I think Enterprise Edition is the best fit for you. That comes at 117 per user per month.
Agent: Would that be something that's a realistic
EndUser: Budget for you all?
Speaker 6: Thank you. I'll probably talk about this. I'm sorry to interrupt. [PERSON-15] and [PERSON-1], who were y'all thinking
Speaker 5: As the 10.
EndUser: I don't know that we did. I
Speaker 5: Can't remember. I think.
Speaker 6: My only
Speaker 5: Guess would be the B D team, I think that's what we initially said.
EndUser: But I don't know what they would.
Speaker 5: It was. But I don't think that they'll, I mean. It depends.
Agent: From a functionality perspective, more from the billing piece, I think, from the opportunity perspective, who needs it that I don't know. We can get creative with the billing piece.
Agent: Hider, feel free to interrupt me as well, but I do not believe you need a full license
Agent: If you're just looking for billing. So there is a workaround around that.
Agent: But when it comes to and [ORG-21], am I correct in saying that?
Agent: Who needs full
Agent: Yes, so basically the people who are managing the opportunity pipeline the full serum license.
Agent: And sales, they would need
Agent: Anyone else, like if invoicing piece, you need [PERSON-4], you know, the platform way reduced, right?
Agent: You just want to use the
Agent: License, which is like
Agent: So they can get by with the platform license.
Agent: And then for time, same thing for time sheets, right?
Agent: So because people who are logging time sheets, they may not need to interact with anything else at all.
Agent: And so in that case, you can get something similarly for that. And if they are external contractors, then you can get the contractor license for that.
Agent: Yeah, so yeah, platform licenses are 33 per user per month, so relatively simple, simple thing to add on.
Agent: So you don't have to commit to this on this call, but leaving it to the next call is we're starting with pricing, just having a number of who needs access to those full licenses choose you guys a quick email if you wouldn't mind just So the next call, we can kind of factor that in.
EndUser: And who needs access to that billing. I'll go ahead and letting us know what that is.
Agent: What did you say that [ORG-18] was per month per user?
Agent: Per user per month. Okay.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Then I can go ahead and present my screen said you want to share the platform pricing as well?
Agent: Here. They
Agent: Yeah. I believe I mentioned it really briefly. It's 21 per user per month. Yeah.
Agent: So I'll go ahead and follow up with an email real quick, but as soon as you guys get that final number, I'll factor that into pricing.
Agent: But as far as kind of what we wanted to share [DATE-1], I believe we covered everything. So we wanted to present next steps here.
Agent: So [PERSON-2], thanks for the great, and I'm going to be still on the call here, but thanks for the great demonstration, really appreciate it.
Agent: So our next call is going to be kind of dedicated towards one, how much will these licenses cost.
Agent: Total and then two understanding that you guys have a good understanding of th e platform is what is it going to look like implemented with your business.
Agent: S o it's going to be [TIME-18] long call here where we talk a little bit abou t that and then ultimately kind of go with contract execution .
Agent: One thing I will mention with [ORG-1] is we typically like to evaluate things within [DATE-21].
Agent: So, I wanted to check in here, was hoping to get this solution in pricing review done either [DATE-16] or [DATE-17], followed by a sign date by no later than January 28st.
Agent: I was just curious, is that a good timeline for you all?
Speaker 5: I think the timeline that I think you have the most control of is the next Yeah.
Agent: Call to go over pricing.
Speaker 5: And then, and then we'd meet internally after that I would imagine. I think what we're, you're seeing, or maybe partially seeing, we're going back and forth with who's all going to be involved.
Speaker 5: So depending upon what we're taking off of recruits here, or if they're just communicating, does it make sense for some of those folks on the one side of the business to even have access?
Speaker 5: I don't know that yet. But we need to, we
Agent: Need to understand that.
Agent: Okay, and how much time do you need to meet internally before getting that final number?
Speaker 5: I don't know. I think we'd meet internally after
Agent: The next call with you. Oh, perfect. Well, that's a little bit.
Agent: Well, if that's... I'm going to hop off, but just wanted to share with the group [PERSON-20], [PERSON-1], and I see the name [PERSON-15].
Speaker 5: I'm not sure if it's [PERSON-3]. Doesn't matter.
Agent: So feel free to let me know my email address is hider at cloud junction dot cloud. Obviously I'm on the calendar.
Agent: If there is a need for like more Q&A and you want to understand how these different pieces come together, I'm more than happy to jump on a call and just kind of drive more clarity for you.
Agent: Thank you for your time [DATE-1]. And I'll leave you in case you say Thanks, Hider.
Agent: Fans. Appreciate it. Bye. Very cool. Yeah, I have [TIME-20], but since you guys are meeting internally [DATE-1], we'd
Speaker 5: Love to meet [DATE-16] just to present. No, no, no, we're not meeting internally until after
Agent: Our next call with you. Okay, after, well, one thing I will mention is I do need a headcount for you.
Speaker 5: Before it presents Yeah, exactly. That I think we could
Agent: Figure out relatively easily. Okay. Okay, gotcha. Cool. Well, then as far as availability, you guys are in [ORG-20] We are.
Speaker 5: Time, correct?
Agent: Okay, I do have some time [DATE-16]. I have it free at 200 [ORG-20] if that works Or you're in charge.
Speaker 6: For you all.
Agent: You're the busiest. Yeah, I'm out [DATE-16] afternoon. I am too. No problem. Let me see Do yeah, we can look at [DATE-30].
EndUser: Here.
Agent: Um, could do [DATE-30] [TIME-20].
Speaker 5: I
Speaker 6: Um, how does will be my on [DATE-30].
Agent: Morning?
Agent: We're actually closed
Speaker 6: Okay, gotcha. No worries. No worries.
Agent: That makes sense. I forget about [PERSON-20]. I'm okay. My so I'm out [DATE-20]. If you guys want to run with it, I'm not sure you need me. If we've
Speaker 6: Already decided on numbers.
Speaker 5: Well, we could probably make work.
Agent: [TIME-21]
Speaker 5: Um, let's do
EndUser: Do do. I don't think that. [PERSON-1], [PERSON-1], that you're available [DATE-17].
Agent: She's working there. We're in many times Okay.
EndUser: I'm looking at our calendars. No problem.
Agent: Um,
EndUser: I'm most free on [DATE-17]. Oh, [DATE-17]. Okay. There's actually we could do [DATE-20].
Agent: Sorry.
EndUser: Let's what is [DATE-17]?
EndUser: Oh my god, is it already [DATE-21]?
Agent: Um, and flight.
EndUser: [DATE-33] actually looks good
Agent: For most of us. Um, better than [DATE-20].
EndUser: Um, [TIME-18] [ORG-20],
Agent: Is which is what are you [TIME-20] behind?
Agent: Yeah, that'd be [TIME-21] my time. That works perfect. Yay. Okay.
Speaker 6: Awesome.
Agent: Okay, so I will add you all to that call.
Speaker 5: We should be all set to go.
EndUser: Appreciate the time guys.
Agent: Awesome. Thank you. Thanks,
Agent: [PERSON-4]. I'll",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear evidence of any top concerns the customer had that would prevent the deal from closing. There were some questions and discussions about budget, the number of licenses needed, and the specific features and functionalities of the seller's product. However, these do not necessarily indicate top concerns or deal-breakers for the customer.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1. ""How do you all think this would fit into your business?""
2. ""Is there anything here that we didn't cover or anything you'd like to know more from this demonstration?""
3. ""Do you guys have a budget allocated for this project? And what would that number be?""
4. ""Who needs access to those full licenses choose you guys a quick email if you wouldn't mind just So the next call, we can kind of factor that in.""
5. ""Is that a good timeline for you all?""

These questions show that the sales rep is trying to understand the customer's needs, budget, and timeline. They are open-ended questions that allow the customer to provide more information about their intent.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer seemed to feel that the seller's product has the potential to meet their needs, particularly in terms of reporting and tracking revenue. However, they also expressed a need to understand the product's capabilities better and how it can be customized to fit their specific business processes. The customer also mentioned the need for training to improve adoption within their team.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's budget allocation for the project. The customer mentioned that they don't have a budget allocated yet, but the sales rep still presented the pricing for the Enterprise Edition and the platform licenses.
2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current billing process and their specific needs for billing and invoicing. This would have helped the sales rep tailor the demonstration to better meet the customer's needs.
3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with recruit [PRODUCT-2] and their adoption of the system. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's pain points and how the salesforce solution can address them.
4. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's timeline for implementation and their decision-making process. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's sense of urgency and what they need to do to move the deal forward.
5. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with salesforce and their previous interactions with salesforce Implementation partners. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's level of familiarity with salesforce and their expectations for the project.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of using the seller's product for reporting and tracking revenue brought in by their teams. They mentioned that currently, they have to export data to a different product and do manual data entry, so they are looking forward to having a more streamlined process with the seller's product. They also mentioned that they would like to see what the seller's product can do in terms of billing and invoicing, as they are currently using QuickBooks for that purpose. Overall, the customer seems to be interested in the potential time and labor savings that the seller's product could offer.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The sales representative mentions scheduling a follow-up call to discuss pricing and implementation, but no specific date or time is agreed upon.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They were interested in moving forward and discussed next steps, including a follow-up call to discuss pricing and understanding the platform's implementation with their business. They also requested an internal meeting after the pricing call to finalize details and make a decision. The seller offered to provide additional information and answer any questions to help the customer better understand the platform and its benefits.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""I'm guessing you're in Professional services and you have time sheets that are being logged. We're a similar business. So it's a topic that we have solved for ourselves inside [ORG-1]. And if we don't get to through with [DATE-1], then I can book some time with you and kind of walk you through that. how we do it inside [ORG-1], the entire process from start to end.""

   The customer seemed more engaged as they expressed that they have similar processes and were interested in understanding how the seller's product could help them with their time sheet management.

2. ""And then as far as kind of next steps here, I do have a few questions before we hop off. First and foremost, I know that I mentioned this earlier, do you guys have a budget allocated for this project? And what would that number be?""

   The customer seemed more engaged as they started discussing budget and pricing, indicating that they are considering the purchase and moving forward in the sales process.

3. ""So our next call is going to be kind of dedicated towards one, how much will these licenses cost. And then two, understanding that you guys have a good understanding of the platform, is what is it going to look like implemented with your business. So it's going to be [TIME-18] long call here where we talk a little bit about that and then ultimately kind of go with contract execution.""

   The customer seemed more engaged as they agreed to a follow-up call dedicated to discussing the cost of licenses and implementation with their business, showing that they are interested in moving forward in the sales process.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of their company's product throughout the call. They explained how their product can help the customer with lead management, account management, opportunity pipeline management, and reporting/dashboards. They also provided specific examples of how their product has helped similar companies in the past. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have done a better job:

1. When the customer asked about the possibility of exporting data from another system, the sales rep could have provided more specific examples of how their team has handled similar data migration projects in the past.
2. The sales rep could have done a better job of explaining how their product can help the customer with their specific pain points around billing and invoicing. They briefly mentioned that they have a phased approach and that they can bring in recruit [PRODUCT-2] right away, but they could have provided more detail on how this would specifically address the customer's needs.
3. The sales rep could have done a better job of explaining the different license types and how they align with the customer's specific needs. They briefly mentioned that they have different license types for different types of users, but they could have provided more detail on what those license types are and how they would be used within the customer's organization.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of their product, but there were a few areas where they could have provided more specific and detailed information to address the customer's needs.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were related to the billing and reporting processes. They mentioned the need to track the output of what they are billing and how to better track revenue that the team is bringing in. They also mentioned the need to export data to another product for reporting and data entry, indicating a desire for more streamlined and integrated reporting capabilities within the seller's product.

Additionally, the customer expressed interest in understanding how the seller's product can help them with their specific billing processes, which are time-based and include flat fees per month. They also mentioned the need to customize the product to fit their specific business processes and workflows.

It is important to note that the customer did not express any major concerns about the product itself, but rather the need for it to fit their specific business needs and processes."
video_19773_167_6qr3y000000ohzaAAA,"Agent: Yes, That's good.
Speaker 3: That's what we see.
Agent: And I'm showing you the correct. Before we go into your, your processes. that we have discussed with [GPE-1].
Agent: I always put in a little bit of a disclaimer is the fact that we have built something for this demo that hopefully aligns at least somewhat with your processes.
Agent: But it will never cover the full extent of what your processes are like or what they are going to be like in [GPE-2].
Agent: There's a lot of assumptions that we have to make and some decisions that we have to make just so that we can create a demo that follows a certain path.
Agent: But again, just like, In terms of let us know if there is anything that you would like to know whether the system is able to do that as well because this is just an interpretation of what we've heard so far.
Agent: And it's also good to know that with everything that we're showing almost everything that you see on the screen can be changed to to fit your needs and your wishes.
Agent: So just because a certain screen looks a certain way and maybe shows certain fields doesn't mean that it has to be shown in that order or that those are over fields that you are. able to see.
Agent: It's a super flexible system where we can do just not anything to make i t adhere to your wishes.
Agent: The first thing that we're looking at here is what could be your home screen Basically anytime you log into the [ORG-1] system, you will be shown a screen .
Agent: Now, in this demo org, there is a dashboard that is called the sales manager dashboard, and it has a bunch of components.
Agent: These do not make that much sense when it comes to your particular company, but it is just to show you that you are able to to have a home screen that shows a dashboard with important information for your business that basically gives you a good start at [DATE-1].
Agent: Maybe you want to take a look at some of the metrics that are important to you just to get an overall view before you go into actually doing the work in [GPE-3]. in this history.
Agent: We have added something here on the whole screen called [DATE-2]'s tasks.
Agent: It tells me that we have to call my colleague [PERSON-1] who works for integrals because we are either in a deal with her, we have a contract with her, and we can also see that there's events here.
Agent: So [DATE-2] I have a Zoom call with [PERSON-1] and two of her colleagues. This would be very specific to you as the logged in user.
Agent: So these would show So your tasks, the tasks that you have to fulfill [DATE-2] and the events that are in your planne r [DATE-2] Again, this doesn't have to be shown on this page, but it can be shown on this .
Agent: Scroll down a little bit. We can see orders by product. So we can see that at this point, there's total of six orders in the system. And we can see that and we have just.
Agent: Quite generic with the names of the products.
Agent: We have a raw material type 1 and a raw material type Once we actually start implementing the system, we'll obviously talk to you about the correct naming of the products in the system.
Agent: We can see that we currently have five orders for the raw material type 1 and we have one order for raw material type 2. Just a bunch of important information that we can show on this whole screen.
Agent: The other thing that we see on this whole screen that is good to highlight is our navigation.
Agent: Over here we can see in the top of a corner that we have a bunch of tabs that we can open for all the different what we call objects or data tables in [ORG-1].
Agent: You can see that we can navigate to our accounts to the contact persons that belong to those accounts.
Agent: To the opportunities, contracts, all the orders that are in the system, invoices batches of your product, because you will have to plant the seeds and then harvest the plants.
Agent: So we have come up with a... a bit of a data model around that, your inventory, all of your products and cases, something that we will take a look at. But from here, from this navigation,
Agent: Which is always shown at the top of your screen, you'll be able to go to all the different parts of the system.
Agent: All the way up.
Agent: Maybe one quick addition to that. This one is, well, the likely going to be [GPE-1]'s home Everyone's home screen can be adjusted to whatever fits their needs.
Agent: Screen.
Agent: So let's say look at [PERSON-2]'s home screen will likely be more focused on
Agent: Ongoing orders or inventory or stock, whatever. And [GPE-1]'s might be more focused on emfaloons on who do I have to call [DATE-2], etc. Yeah, definitely. We can make it so that it's whoever is the locking user best.
Agent: But on the top here, also something that's always visible that your search bar and can search for any data in the system. So for instance, I want to find the account for integrals.
Agent: I can start typing integrals and it'll come up with a bunch of suggestions for what I'm looking for. There's also an integrals opportunity. There's a contact that is related to the integrals account.
Agent: Basically, a global search bar that gives me access to all the data. So if you know what you are looking for in the system, you might not have to go through the integrals.
Agent: That you can just search for records right away . In the top right corner over here, we have a bunch of additional stuff to navigate to the system, your own account over here.
Agent: I am logged in as running <inaudible>. And I can also go to my personal settings here to change anything to make the system work best for me.
Agent: Well, the next point that I want to show is basically going into the different what I previously called objects. Just to give you a feel or what happens when you start using the natural system.
Agent: So I'm going to first start looking at an account. And an account is basically the company that you are hopefully either going to have a sale deal with or end up with a contractor with.
Agent: I have created an account for integrals. We're going to be following that account along in this demo.
Agent: But before I go and click on that, I would like to tell you a little bit more about the screen that we see over here. You can see that in the top left corner, it says recently viewed.
Agent: It basically tells me these are the accounts that the records that you have recently taken over here.
Agent: But I'm able to change what we call the list view over here and say, for instance, I want to see all the accounts in the system. Please keep in mind that this is. all demo data.
Agent: So you haven't created all accounts to suit your company or the industry that yo u work in. These are all just the dummy data that [ORG-1] sends along.
Agent: But you can see that I now have changed the list view to basically showing an overview of all the accounts that are in th e system .
Agent: And even from here, we are able to put filters on the system.
Agent: So if there is a reason for me to filter on here, and for instance, say, you know what?
Agent: I only want to see in my ListView the accounts with time customer direct, and I would be able to go to the top right corner over here and basically add a filter in. It currently is only filtered.
Agent: By owner and it says all accounts. So there's actually no filter on the owner.
Agent: But we can add a filter here and say, you know what?
Agent: I would like to only see the customer direct type. All I would have to do there is say, I go to the type and I say I wanted to equal customer direct.
Agent: And as I do that, you will see that my list changes. And now the list only shows the customer direct.
Agent: Now, this enables you to make lists of records in the system that totally suit the way you use the system.
Agent: And some of these list views like this all accounts list view are public, which means that it is probably not a good idea to give everybody the rights to put filters on it, because every time you revisit, you might see a different list view, but you are definitely able to make your own private list views, the ones that work for you.
Agent: So you could clone one like the all accounts.
Agent: List view and say you know what I'm going to put my own list view in and I'm going to make one for all the direct customers or I'm going to make one for all the customers from [GPE-4].
Agent: You're totally in charge of creating
Agent: Your own list views make them work.
Agent: [GPE-4] is not the best best.
Agent: There won't be very many
Agent: Accounts from [GPE-4] in hope you kept my drift that you are able to make so personal.
Speaker 3: The system, but I
Agent: It's basically any data that belongs to these records.
Agent: Next step is actually going into one of those records, and I will, as I was saying, I will use the [PRODUCT-1]'s account as an example, because this is where you're going to find a lot of information about what is going on with your customers.
Agent: Any record that is opened will always show some important information on top.
Agent: And there will always be a detail section which basically has all the fields of all the different data that you would like to store about that particular type of record.
Agent: So in this case, we are looking at an account which represents a company that you are doing business with. And there is a bunch of fields that we can fill out over here.
Agent: But like I said earlier, these are just fields or most of them are fields that are part of this demo environment, but you can basically add any information here or remove any information here that is not important.
Agent: And you're able to divide the information up into different sections, sections that can actually be collapsed as well, but they're not interesting to you.
Agent: But in that way, we have a lot of flexibility to store the type of information that is important. on the account.
Agent: In this case, we've got a phone number, we've got a website, we've got some information about the industry and again that type field that we saw earlier.
Agent: Before I go into the different records that are related to this account, which you will find behind these tabs over here, I'd first would like to take a look at this section to the right over here, where it says activity.
Agent: Because on each record within the [ORG-1] system, you are able to log certain activities.
Agent: And they range from creating a task that you want to be associated to this record, creating an event that you would like to be associated. You can also log a call.
Agent: So if you've had a call or a meeting and you would like to log some information about what was said in that, you can do that as well.
Agent: And then you can even email from the system if that is something that you choose to log in.
Speaker 3: To what to do . One question on the emails, I'd say. So you basically have the manually login.
Speaker 3: Is there any option to summarize it with the email?
Speaker 3: I think that was the point that was about to make it. [GPE-1], regardless of whether you guys use [ORG-2] or Outlook, it's a choice whether you log all your emails or whether you decide to log your emails.
Speaker 3: Only the emails you want to log. For example, even within my own team, like there's certain colleagues who lock every email, but I also have customers I know pretty well.
Speaker 3: So that means not every email is suitable for everyone to read. But the purpose is, let's say you make commercial agreements, or there's a question about the delivery.
Speaker 3: Obviously, you're going to mention it, maybe to [PERSON-2] and the team, but it's also locked in the system. And they can also see, hey, I so-called, everybody has spoke to discuss it, like it helps for your own.
Speaker 3: Memory, so to say, but it also helps to make give people insight on what has been [ORG-3] d because let's say, [PERSON-3], you leave the company in [DATE-3] .
Speaker 3: Then there will be a history of what has been said, and whenever you lost, spoken to this customer, et cetera, et cetera.
Agent: [PERSON-4], I think if you can be so kind to press on [ORG-4]. [PERSON-5] is a way in which you can communicate with each other.
Agent: Now I imagine you guys at this point, you use email a lot or you call or whatever.
Agent: With [PERSON-5], you can put on any record you could say, for example, hey, [PERSON-2], please be aware, this customer was not happy with the loss, no offense, [PERSON-2], but with the loss that every kid you put some extra eyes on this or the other way around.
Agent: Hey, [GPE-5].
Agent: Can you send me the last details regarding this shipment whatever, but it helps you to communicate in a wa y that you can always look back from, hey this is happening at this customer, at this order at this opportunity whatsoever .
Agent: Well, that's how you can minimize the, let's say, communication that will get lost anyway and maximize the insights for everyone who will see that.
Speaker 4: One question about the email is it also possible to log emails that are sent from our group?
Agent: Like with a plug-in or something?
Agent: Yeah definitely [PERSON-6] there's two ways like I prefer but that's also personal [ORG-2].
Speaker 4: Choice just to work for my
Agent: Only I do not have that for this demo or organize.
Agent: Do you have your email synced to this?
Agent: No What we do [PERSON-6] we have like outlook so then on the right side of your outlook screen you could just say log to
Speaker 4: A plug-in for your
Agent: Log it to [ORG-1]. I can show you probably
Speaker 5: In my own... Can I just interrupt just Yep I just need to leave you for [TIME-1].
Agent: A second?
Speaker 5: We have a briefing for [DATE-4]. We have the DKMA, our authorities inspection [DATE-4]. We just have a briefing with the [ORG-5] company. So I just leave you get you our
Agent: With [TIME-1] and then I'll be back.
Speaker 3: Ok. We'll prints. Yeah. We can then leave the operational part for on the
Agent: Class. We'll come
Agent: Back. I was just going into my old email because we have it our own system.
Speaker 4: Set up for
Agent: I just need ability to then log this email and it don't ask me.
Agent: What record into?
Speaker 3: Would you like to log
Agent: I'm not going to do it here because it's not connected to our system that we're looking it is basically a tool inside your, inside your outlook that will allow you Okay.
Speaker 3: At the demo for, but
Speaker 4: To make that connection with any sales for a record.
Agent: All right. So. What happens with all of those activity items, like tasks, events, calls that are logged and even the emails, they all end up in this feed over here.
Agent: So while you're on the account, you can see everything that has happened. And this is actually what we see over here is not directly added in the activity feed of this account.
Agent: It actually comes from the the contact record that is related to this account because it also rolls up, which means that any conflict you have with a.. a contact within that company
Agent: That information will go up over here as well.
Agent: And I think maybe to add to that like you can see all activities here are like the hand but the same goes and we will see that later for orders so if there's any question about a particular order you can see you can log in on the order itself.
Agent: Are related to the contacts
Agent: But it can also show up on let's say the account page. So there's multiple ways of logging and even more important than logging, being able to find back
Speaker 3: Your
Agent: Whatever you have logged.
Agent: So, records of different objects inside [ORG-1], they have relationship with other records.
Agent: And it is usually what we call a parent child relationship, which means that if you have an account, for instance, it can have a bunch of children, let's say contact persons, hang it underneath it.
Agent: And those contact persons basically look up to your main or your parent record, which would be the account. So we won't be able to see that over here as well.
Agent: If I go to this context tab over here, you can see that there are two contexts, running long and going along that are related to this account.
Agent: Which is handy to know from the account record, to just be able to see what relationships exist.
Agent: If I open [ORG-6] contact record, we have now moved away from the account record and moved into a contact record for this person, where we find all the information about this person.
Agent: But we also find that relationship up here where it says account name. We have the ability to click back. onto the account vein to open that account record again.
Agent: So this way, within the system, you can easily navigate between all the records that have a relationship with each other.
Agent: And that doesn't only go for context that are related to an account, but as you can see, there's also opportunities that can be related to account and orders and contracts and even cases.
Agent: So that is basically the way standard set up for sales force works that you can have a lot of relationships between the different breakers. We are back on [PERSON-7]'s contact record.
Agent: We find some information about her over here that is more personal, like her phone number, her email.
Agent: You can see that all those log activities that we just saw on the account actually originate over here because we have logged it on this contact record.
Agent: But because there is a relationship between the contact and the account, we also see it on the account record.
Agent: Which makes it easy for us to know what kind of conversations have taken place, what kind of emails have been logged. Again, this is just some information that is stored about the client.
Agent: You can add as much or as little here as you want to, but
Agent: It is a good place to come to find some more information about this contact. I think maybe to finalize on everyone's clear on the logging, the communication, etc.
Agent: That, I think
Agent: You can also set some minimum requirements before you're allowed to add a contact, because that's also something we see quite a lot of needs.
Agent: For example, icons add anyone if I don't have a functioning email address or a functioning phone number. And what the system will also do, it will also recognize duplicates.
Agent: So that whenever I try to add another color, it says, hey, it seems like you already have this person, which sales or whatever.
Agent: Is especially if you're doing
Agent: And I think final one, which can also be interesting, only if you can go back to the inte this account
Agent: Page. Absolutely.
Agent: We can add, let's say, what you see there, we haven't set it up, but there's a field called Baron the Count.
Agent: [ORG-7] versus also able to work with an umbrella structure, let's say we have Intirious and then we can say, for example, [GPE-6], Intirious [GPE-7], [NORP-1], whatever structure
Speaker 3: You would like, you can put it in there and then in the end, you can also on solely Intirious or one of these
Agent: Start reporting subsidiaries among them. Yes, useful actually because we have some content.
Agent: Have a subsidiary of different countries in [GPE-8], [GPE-9], sorry So that would mean, not asking you to show that again for individual things But then you can me all communication with the [ORG-8] or show me everythin g that's [GPE-7], [GPE-8], etc And I think start we need but I'm
Agent: Also see like show
Agent: Before we to wait with [PERSON-2] being back But I think the next step in the demo will be to go for opportunities . Yes, and the contracts.
Agent: Yeah, I was just going to quickly show that when you do have a parent account, and in this case, the parent account is [ORG-9], but that because we don't have an actual [ORG-10] like mother company in the system.
Agent: But you are able to also do that account hierarchy so you can actually see how the hierarchy will take and go several layers deep. And you can see [ORG-10] hangs under [ORG-8], and this is a
Agent: Because that is the mother company jail company, or parent company.
Agent: Did you say that you wanted to wait for?
Agent: No, I think you're going
Agent: To get an opportunity to go on drugs now. I think we need to close this input most on whatever is related to order and [ORG-15] and [ORG-15] numbers at all should be. Yes, the contact relationship.
Agent: But there's also a relationship that an account can have with an opportunity.
Agent: And in your case, what the envisioned opportunity is, is actually a deal that you've got to strike with a customer in order to get a contract set up with them.
Agent: So in very common salesforce terms, it is usually an opportunity amounts to when you win the opportunity, you have a sale. But in your case, we believe it's to these.
Agent: That works towards actually setting up a contract with a customer.
Agent: So, and of course if it needs to be different, then it can always be changed because this is just a demo work [ORG-15] we can make it cool into your liking. I've opened the opportunity now.
Agent: We got all the opportunity i n [GPE-10], [DATE-5] contract, the first contract. And as you can see on an opportunity we have what we call the opportunity stages that an opportunity can go through.
Agent: And these ar e definitel y Editable and we can change into your likings.
Agent: This is just something that we have set up for this demo now We see the needs analysis that could be the very first stage if this opportunity sits in what are the actual needs of the [ORG-8] integrous company and we can go to a proposal or a price vote in your case maybe Getting the pricing set for the contract that you would like this [ORG-18] to sign with you that are following stage be negotiation and review of your proposal.
Agent: And then eventually, when the company agree s and they want to set up a contract with you, you can set an opportunity as closed one You can see that the opportunity that we have here in the system is already set to clos e one.
Agent: That was helpful for me because then I was able to show the rest of the process But before we
Agent: Ever closed it, we added some products to this We will be learning quick, quick add on [DATE-2]'s A nd As you can see, like we divided it into four different phases, but what I was thinking about for you guys, you can also maybe add one phase.
Agent: Legal review. And then until someone who has the proper authority says, okay, they meet all the legal requirements, you can move it up and let's say set up whatever you want to the real contract.
Speaker 3: So guard. So to say, before moving up, you can put checkmarks,
Agent: In, let's say Security etc.
Agent: Before moving on. Yeah, of course, they could adjust the stages of course. But it's a good thing on there's a possibility of having those.
Agent: And in combination with that, you are also able to set up something that we haven't set up here, but that you could do is an approval process, which means that internally, anything needs to be checked before go ahead has given to actually close the deal.
Speaker 3: The
Agent: You can also make it so that this record is submitted to somebody else within the company for approval. It basically locks the entire record. Nothing can be checked.
Agent: Change that person and takes a look at the recognize that's all this looks good I think there's no issues here .
Speaker 3: And then he
Agent: Approved, he or she approved, and actually
Speaker 4: You are now able to close the opportunity and start creating this contract. So, bit too much to show here, but they're not starting I'm sorry.
Agent: A documents here.
Speaker 4: And
Agent: I was just wondering, we're using a docu sign.
Agent: Does it integrate well with [ORG-1] as well?
Agent: It does. Yeah. You are able to, when you get to the contract phase of the process, you are able to do all of your [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: You can even do the document generation [ORG-1] and then also sending it receiving it and any automation around there, basically.
Speaker 4: From
Speaker 4: Off for signing and then
Agent: So that is possible for your information because I think it's [PERSON-6] who was asking the question is that We we have Already basically providing a quote as an Implementation partner for the work that we envision needs to be done for Federal gun and I don't believe off the top of my head that
Speaker 3: Document generation or document signing is part of that puzzle, but that it is a possibility And there's also
Agent: It is very good to know
Agent: Something that you may need to have for a phase two or a later phase Yeah,
Speaker 4: Yeah, we'll try to keep it simple of course. So whether it's always good to know Yeah, be careful.
Agent: What's possible Well, when his answer is always that it's possible
Agent: Yeah, we have definitely done that before, specifically with [PRODUCT-2], and we also use [PRODUCT-2] ourselves. So that Integration is very known to us for a familiar way.
Agent: And then once that, I guess I was saying about the products that we've added products to this opportunity, because I can imagine that maybe there is some negotiation about the sales price. So what I've done here. really simple.
Agent: I've added a product of that raw material type 1. I set [QUANTITY-1] for let's say [DATE-6]. Obviously, I'm not [PERCENT-1] familiar with what our normal quantities for you, but they're with me.
Agent: I haven't had a sales price for [MONEY-1]. Again, I don't know what the prices are, but just to get a feel for it. And this is actually what we are agreeing on with this customer.
Agent: The contract should be here. Well, then once we have closed this opportunity, it would be time to create a contract. And you can see that there is a contract already related to this opportunity.
Agent: And that is actually the next step in the process is putting this contract together. And then in the future, you might be able to add some document generation and document signing there as well.
Agent: And I will click on this contract to go to the contract record. And what is maybe good to show there. immediately is that this contract record is not only related to the opportunity .
Agent: As we can see here, but it is also related to the account that the opportunity is for.
Agent: So, which means that if we go back to the integrous, sorry, integrous account, we would find this 158 contract there related as well, and I can quickly show you. We are integrars, we have a contracts tab over here.
Agent: We open it and we can see that 107 is mentioned over here as well. So that basically brings the loop back to the account.
Agent: And we are ensuring that all the important records are related to the correct other records in the system. We've got a contract here. Once again, we have come up with some stages here. In this case, we said draft.
Agent: We have an approval process, which we haven't actually set it up, but that could be a stage. It is currently sitting in a waiting for approval from somebody else within a company, and then after that, it is activated.
Agent: And there's also, obviously, a moment at which may be a contract. Some information that can be stored on a contract.
Agent: That basically other than the opportunity is related to it, the account that is related to is a price book that is related here because you are after all making an agreement on the sale of certain products and just a bunch of other information like a contract Start Date and the contract term.
Agent: Maybe good to see over here that when we look at the contract Start Date it is an actual field that we can fill out. Contract end date.
Agent: Not so much We cannot make any edits there because it' s what we call a formula field, whic h means that it is calculated based on this contract term over here So [DATE-7] are added to the context of Start Date to come up with the contract .
Agent: And date. Over here again you see activity. So any activity that needs to be related to the contract can be added over here. You're going to see this activity component everywhere in the system for all the different records.
Agent: So of relating it to
Agent: You have the flexibility whatever record you want. Finally, it is important.
Agent: I think go ahead. I'm to need the next likely be orders
Agent: Going step will if I am from our reparation.
Agent: Are there any other questions, maybe both from your IT perspective or for whom [GPE-1] from a commercial perspective which you would like to see because I do want [PERSON-2] to be let's say at least involved in seeing where the order process starts what it means for him.
Speaker 3: Do you guys have any other questions at this point?
Speaker 3: No, I don't know.
Agent: What is
Speaker 3: The small question here?
Speaker 3: So I can see the end date of the contract and then how the system usually a, like the,
Agent: Reacts if there's
Agent: They did approaching towards the end of the contract. It's like another application or.
Agent: Well, what we, what we could do for instance, what we do for a lot of customers is that a certain number of [DATE-8] or [DATE-9] before the end date, a task could already be created or perhaps a renewal opportunity could be created.
Speaker 3: That work with the contract
Agent: Automatically, which somebody then receives a task abou t meaning, hey, this is about to end s time, you will need to go back into negotiation with [ORG-14] company for the next contract that you want t o get in.
Speaker 3: In, let's say, [DATE-10]
Agent: So it is something that is standard, it doesn't happe n automatically. But it is something that we very ofte n configured in this kind of situation.
Agent: So at any point tha t you find it important that somebody i s is notified about the fact that th is The contract is almost up. We can create a new them.
Speaker 3: Opportunity for it, a new task or a combination of
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Yes, it's good to know. Maybe for [PERSON-6] because [PERSON-6], you mentioned the possibility of integrating with [PRODUCT-2].
Speaker 4: I have one question
Agent: Well, are there any other Integration like we've been discussing for integrating with [PERSON-8]?
Speaker 4: With [GPE-1] the need
Agent: Yeah, there was some. and I'm expecting you to ask the same question at some point.
Agent: Maybe to be to give full transparency on that, like [ORG-1] as an open API, and it's super friendly and integrating whatever you would like. But it also comes with a certain cost.
Agent: So I think what we've agreed upon at this point with [GPE-1], that it's not necessary for users to integrate with [ORG-14] just now as the amount of invoices will be limited.
Agent: So that can be done either via [DATE-8] or
Speaker 4: Weekly or by [DATE-8] dump.
Agent: Yeah, that's fine as well, like an import export is fine. That's something like that, because I feel like that it does require quite an amount of [TIME-2].
Agent: And at this point, it's I don't feel that adds a lot of value to the project. Obviously, you're an IT things as smooth as possible.
Speaker 4: [PERSON-9], so you want to make
Agent: But like if it's necessary in the future, that definitely is possible. Are there any other... maybe integrations we may have overlooked
Speaker 4: In the process which you're thinking about?
Speaker 4: Well, we also use [NORP-2] for dashboards and reporting finances. Is there any Integration
Agent: Possible with that?
Agent: Or is it the same way?
Agent: I think it's definitely the answer always is it's possible given that [NORP-2] is an open API.
Agent: Where does the Let's say the truth lies for the input now an exact globe?
Speaker 4: Of [NORP-2]. Is that
Agent: Is it just financial?
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Then it likely is possible, but then obviously we need to and we're more than happy to help you guys with the t-hiss to think
Agent: Which input you want to provide from let's say sales force and which input still needs to come from [ORG-8], but that definitely is possible.
Agent: And I guess in that regard, it's also if you decide to make an Integration with exact globe, for instance, and some of the information that you are reporting on in exact globe, actually also finds its way to [ORG-1], then you might also be able to take care of that part of the reporting and dashboarding inside [ORG-1] itself, because it also has a reporting So let's say that we are sending invoice information over from exact globe to [ORG-1], not behalf of this information in [ORG-1], we can also report on it.
Speaker 4: And dashboard into.
Agent: Yeah, that makes sense . Yeah, but definitely there will be certain dashboards and reports that you have in [NORP-2] that we won't have the data of in [ORG-1]. So then an Integration would be in place.
Agent: And like [PERSON-10] said, as long as there's an open API, do your own books and what else. and sometimes with tools like these,
Agent: There's also already a connector setup which makes it even easier. I don't know specifically for the one that you mentioned, [NORP-2], but that is something There's a lot of time.
Agent: We can definitely look into.
Agent: I've heard it before and I
Speaker 3: Know if it's integrated, so it's exhocked, it's likely to integrate with itself as well, but we can don't check. And maybe... My question on the countries as well, understanding it.
Agent: Just for
Speaker 3: So when the country is signed, we have like
Agent: A PDF version of signed contract, if it will be doing outside of the [ORG-1], upload the contract to the system or the store, can you store it basically in there?
Speaker 3: Never
Agent: So I think I have it available over here. I just clicked on this related list here. And if I scroll down, well, I don't see it here, but it's the wrong, but you can basically upload files here.
Agent: So any file that you have sitting in your local system that you would like to be added here can be added here.
Agent: This is a bit of an outdated one, because usually this would be called files, but files can be uploaded here. So even if it's done outside your system, because maybe you're not integrating with [PRODUCT-2], you can easily.
Agent: Added to the system here so that you have And you limit on the it available .
Speaker 3: Don't forget to subscribe to my channel.
Agent: Storage?
Agent: I was just, yeah, there is, but like, please just use us to log contracts and whatever. I think there's quite a high limit, but please do not use us to start storing 85 of the new company video.
Agent: Different versions
Agent: You're more than happy to, but then I'll give you a call [DATE-15] to say you need to buy more file stories.
Agent: Whenever there's customers who are in need of, let's say, a lot of file stories going up to terabytes, we're likely to find another solution or integrate with someone that's actually built to store data.
Agent: We allow quite some, and I hardly ever run into trouble, but we want to keep our platform quick as well. So it's whenever you reach our limits, the prices are.
Agent: Are pretty high, so it makes no sense to store it in silsorg But I don't see an y
Agent: Any problem with
Agent: Your type of business to do that.
Agent: And maybe, I think, honey, maybe it is an idea to look with the people who are here now to I'm getting some sun now here as well, with to look at the whole flow from contract.
Agent: The whole,
Agent: Oh, perfect timing
Agent: From from [PERSON-2]. Yeah. [PERSON-2], maybe to bring you up to speed, we just finished, let's say, the whole commercial part of things up to a new contract that has been signed with a certain volume.
Agent: And now the next step in this process will be that we go to the actual orders.
Agent: So [DATE-5], I would say, thank you. I'll take it away. We're looking at the contract record over here, and we can see an orders tab over here.
Agent: And we saw that same orders tab on the account record as well. because when you create an order, it can be associated with both an account and a contract and also with other items.
Agent: But we can see here that for this particular contract, There are four orders already in the system. And you can see that there's some more information about each order shown over here.
Agent: Whatever information is shown here can be changed to the Junids. But it's basically information from each individual record that we have here.
Agent: And we have basically, when we discussed with [GPE-1], we basically said, well, there's two scenarios when it comes to an order, or actually three. And we have done some of our own interpretation here.
Agent: So if it's not completely correct, don't worry, things can be changed. Basically, what we said is an order can be of a certain size.
Agent: Let's say that we need this raw material as a customer, and we want [QUANTITY-2] of it. Well, when we start.
Agent: Planting the seeds and harvesting it that will more than likely in a [DATE-15]'s time like one harvest will be let's say for one batch will be [QUANTITY-3] .
Agent: That means that if we only need [QUANTITY-2], that there's still [QUANTITY-4] of that batch that is basically unallocated. We don't, we don't at least discuss the rate.
Agent: At this point, doesn't, doesn't need it because it has only ordered 31. Well, that's one scenario where you basically ordering less than a batch size.
Agent: There's also the, um, possibility that you order more than would come from one batch. I've understood I think that the batch size is normally somewhere between 65 and [QUANTITY-5] from one cell or from one room.
Agent: The next batch would be needed, for instance, where we need [QUANTITY-6] of the raw material. We need two batches in order to fulfill our order. So let's take a look at thatscenario first.
Agent: We got an order here, number 81, and I'll open it here in the system. And we can see that it has a bunch of different statuses that it runs through. You can see this part.
Agent: From the top over here. We have obviously just come up with this sum. This definitely can b e made, customized so that it is specifically aligned with what your process is.
Agent: But we basically said, well, an order is placed, then stuff is planted, stuff is harvested, then the batch needs to be tested.
Agent: Then I think at some point, Maybe after there's a certain certificate that is assigned and the batch is considered correct, then payment will be expected.
Agent: And again, if this is not the right order, don't worry, everything can be changed. Then the order picking starts, so message is sent to the warehouse, then it's made ready for shipment.
Agent: Then it is picked up by the logistics partner, then the customer is informed by the fact that the logistics partner is on their way with a track and trace code. And then it is.
Agent: Again, we took some liberty here, but just coming up with a few of these statuses o r stages, whatever you'd like to call it But this is how you could basically set up this path towards delivering the goods And all along the way, you can of course automate the creation of certain tasks So maybe when the payment pending is no longer pending and the invoice has been paid, [ORG-19] e this is the point at whic h the order picking should, the where I should be notifie d. Well, then in that case, a pass could be creat ed for somebody in their warehouse or an email could be se nt to a certain email address to noti fy
Speaker 6: That this order is now ready fo r. I had a quick question on this.
Agent: Order process can be customized according to individual order. So.
Agent: Yes, so if it can definitely be customized, if you have certain types of orders, you can you can make it so that a different set of statuses is used for each type of order.
Agent: And for instance, you can you can think about an order in the [GPE-9] running through a different process than an order in [GPE-2].
Agent: You could make it so that if it is in order for [GPE-2], this process is used if it is for the [GPE-9], then a different process is used.
Speaker 6: Maybe to head to that for who is that what you mean?
Agent: Like different.
Agent: Maybe because let's say if I we have a different payment term with one account over the standard, can I customize just that part or?
Agent: It can be done, but I do believe like.
Agent: You can, I would say let's use two or three maybe main order flows like whenever there's what I would recommend for you guys because like the amount of orders is not necessarily really high but you can have say let's say what I feel would be very valuable for you.
Agent: If the order reaches the status payment pending, It cannot move forward to order picking until you or [LOC-1]. Let's say give the check, this is okay, this order can be picked.
Agent: The other way around, it can also say that [PERSON-2] is the one who guards. Okay, we're now picking this order and it won't be ready for shipment until it meets these requirements or whatever.
Agent: I think but you already seem to understand that if alone you can select whatever flow you want. And since there's, I think this is the key for success for your company .
Agent: This is where commercial team meets the production team and vice versa. So this is where you should find a way to like collaborate without having to call and email each other all the time.
Agent: So that [PERSON-2] produce and the commercial team knows what the status of the order is.
Agent: Knows what he needs to
Agent: And I think looking at you, honey, our experience is that we can come up with an amazing plan with you guys.
Agent: And then after [DATE-8], you say, we're gonna take two steps out because it's too many steps or we need like that.
Agent: That's That's always that always happens, but like whatever but I think everyone here understands the How do you say that the principle of sending these steps and doing the checks etc etc.
Agent: You want is possible,
Agent: Yeah, maybe also a small addition to that Particularly to this order, you also see the activity screen on the right.
Agent: So you can also, if you have a call related to this order, that will also be found here for everyone to see.
Agent: That's the final thing I wanted to add to this particular thing.
Agent: I think it's a good point I tell you this, making that something called validation rules can be written to make it so that certain things can only happen if certain criteria are are next.
Agent: We also on an order for instance have access to information on the related account.
Agent: So if there is a type of payment that has been agreed with the customer, then that information can flow back to this order and it can influence your validation of whether or not you can move to the next stage.
Agent: So there's a lot possible there to make it so that you sort of customize it without touching this
Agent: Path too much because you don't
Agent: Want to constantly have to change. Now this is still good enough even though.
Agent: Yeah, we're looking at the time can w e I just need to move you to the right just a little bit because you might see the sun on my the screen at all.
Agent: Face and it makes it so that I can't see
Agent: That's all I'm going to roll in this meeting.
Agent: Just for your expectations, you're learning I think you live [QUANTITY-7] from me and the sun already's gone here so. Perfect, that's good to know. Then I'll move back to the left in [TIME-3].
Agent: What we've done on this order, we have basically added order products, which means, again, here we have that raw material type one.
Agent: Sorry for that pop up and we have said we need [QUANTITY-6] of that and the unit price over here is [QUANTITY-8].
Agent: So, let's go down to the details section, we can see that the order placed is the status that's the same as what we see over here. We can see that the order amount is for [MONEY-2]. That's because.
Agent: Euros per kilogram times [QUANTITY-6] gets up a steady amount . There's a whole lot of other information that we don't store on this particular order right here, but that you could choose to store.
Agent: This is, I've come up with a few fields that are about the import permit. and the export permit that might be needed.
Agent: So there's a section here about the permits that basically says have they been created?
Agent: Are they available and when, where they confirmed just information that you might find is needed on your order?
Agent: But you can also see that I have a logistics partner here. If you would like to keep track of your logistics partners as accounts in your system, you can get the best certain.
Agent: Account type, for instance, a logistics partner type, then we can make it so that you can als o put that information here.
Agent: And here we can see that there's a track and trace Code that we coul d add here once that becomes available, when the logistics partner is going t o And then we can also have a checkbox agency that has been shared with the customer.
Agent: So if the customer is, and this sharing with the customer is also something that we can automate. So you don't necessarily always have to send an email manually.
Agent: We can make it so that it a certain order stage or status has been reached that automatically. Or a checkbox has been ticked. Then we can automatically send out that email to. Yeah.
Speaker 3: That way
Agent: You don't always have to. to a panel .
Agent: And the product Code that could be a batch number, right?
Agent: No, but we're getting to now. Yeah, we get into how we came up with the, what we came up with for the batches. So actually the Code of this product.
Speaker 3: This product [LAW-1] is
Agent: So that is basically just, I just came up with something because it's raw material, one I just, R and one, but that's basically in your catalog of products, that is the Code for that specific product.
Agent: It doesn't have anything to do with the batch. But as you can see over here, batch allocations.
Speaker 3: We have something called And.
Agent: That batch allocation shows you records And in this case, it shows us two records because as we said we have a quantity of [QUANTITY-6] and we're not able to get that from one batch At least that's our understanding because of the [DATE-18] batches that ar e harvest at a maximum of about 79 to [QUANTITY-9] So we said, okay, we are going t o get [QUANTITY-3] from this batch and we get the from batch number three.
Speaker 3: Number two,
Speaker 4: Remaining 18
Agent: Again, this is definitely something that might not be in line with how it works for you, but just there with us because then at least you can get a feel for what this information can do.
Agent: If we go to this batch number two, we can actually open it from here. So don't be confused by the fact that it says [ORG-19] with a number three over here.
Agent: And the two over here, this is the batch This is the batch allocation That's actually what we are looking at .
Agent: It is basically it batch allocation sits in between the order and the batch and it connects the two two And to batches to this order, namely number two and number three.
Speaker 3: In this case, it connects
Agent: If we first open batch number two. We can see that it has already gone through the planted stage and it is now in the harvested stage.
Agent: We haven't contested it yet, but it was already allocated to this specific order because maybe we didn't plant it until this order was put in. So we've got some information.
Agent: Welcome to inventory and to product just a little bit later on. We've got some information over here about the status. Again, that is harvested.
Agent: It was planted all of [DATE-14] in [DATE-14] and it was harvested on [DATE-8] So that's some information that we store there Then we see the number of allocations Well, the entire [QUANTITY-3] of this harvest, because we have a harvest size of [QUANTITY-3] has been allocated to that one order that we were just looking at, that one order of [QUANTITY-10], which means that there are zero unallocated kilograms left So this is the harvest size of the harvest size specific batch.
Agent: All of [QUANTITY-8] that make up this batch have been allocate d. And when we go to batch allocations over here, we will see that one batch allocation. And namely, it's with that order that we just saw.
Agent: So both on the order record, as well as on the batch record, you will see a batch allocation, which gives you information about what the batch was used for.
Agent: And on the order side, which batches were used to fill that. order. So from here, we would be able to go back to this order to see that information.
Agent: But what's important to know about this batch is that it doesn't have any unallocated kilogram kilogram. Everything all [QUANTITY-3] have been allocated to our order. If we then go back to that order.
Agent: I'll click here on the order number again. That's at 95. And we take another look at the batch allocations. Then we can also find that second batch, [QUANTITY-15] that were needed to fulfill our [QUANTITY-6].
Agent: Before I do that, I forgot to mention one thing that is just a little extra detail. I go back to the details section. There is a field over here called packaging.
Agent: You told us [DATE-19], [GPE-1], it's either [QUANTITY-15] bags or [QUANTITY-8] bags.
Speaker 3: Most cases
Agent: We've made a
Speaker 3: Little field here that just says which packaging is used normally.
Agent: Just didn't want two forget about it. That's useful because we'll have available.
Speaker 3: Different types of packaging
Agent: If it ends up being five, [DATE-19], two hundred, four hundred then we can just add options. Go back to the batch allocation, we'll cite that there and we can take a look at that batch number three.
Agent: Batch number three is a batch that also is in the harvested stage It was harvested [DATE-8] And you can see that it has a harvest size of [QUANTITY-18] .
Agent: Currently, there is [QUANTITY-14] already allocated because it has two allocations, which means that there are [QUANTITY-14] unallocated. That makes sense because [QUANTITY-8] is [DATE-29].
Agent: So we still have [QUANTITY-14] of this particular batch that have not been allocated to any order, which means that it will probably [PERSON-8],
Agent: Need to be stored. can I time [PERSON-2].
Speaker 5: You on for [TIME-4]?
Agent: [PERSON-2] still here?
Agent: [PERSON-2] still here. Yes, yes, yes.
Agent: What's your thoughts on this?
Speaker 5: Would this also help you in working together with, let's say, the commercial department and to see the overview?
Speaker 5: Absolutely, absolutely. Yes, that's quite important for me.
Speaker 5: And probably also for the commercial to see, okay, what's the status?
Speaker 5: I don't know, we have to figure out whether if we have orders
Agent: That is larger than the batches, whether we divide it into two orders or what we do. But that would be a commercial
Speaker 3: Issue, you could say. Because what you do now, you just harvest [DATE-21], probably.
Speaker 5: Well, once batch [DATE-29],
Agent: Basically, I don't see. I really have a batch which is being harvested. Yeah. And I think, yeah, also because there's a lot of varieties we can show. But I think everyone understands.
Agent: But I think we nailed it on that one. There's a production batch which is linked to orders. But also vice versa. There's orders which can be directly traced to whatever batch has gone.
Agent: In there, I think important what you see, this is linked to a specific product. But I think at this point, you guys have been looking at sales for [TIME-5].
Agent: You can look at either a specific type of product or a specific list of order for a customer or whatever.
Agent: And we'll provide you with a list of, hey, this is ordered for this product, or hey, this customer is going to order this, or hey. even more important maybe.
Agent: Hey, [LOC-1] and for room, please play attention because in [DATE-8] we will have [QUANTITY-19] of unallocated from a certain batch. Okay, and see if there's any anything they would need for that.
Speaker 5: Please call your customers
Agent: So I hope this and please ask any of your questions because I think this was key for us too in the demo.
Agent: Do you guys all feel like you get the right information that you would need for a pleasant working experience every day?
Speaker 3: [DATE-29]
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. All right, just double we're
Agent: Checking before going to show you another simple screen.
Agent: Very good. Thank you, [PERSON-15]. So, so basically what we have seen is that just can either be partially allocated like this one. We can actually see an allocation status here because we have some unallocated kilograms over here.
Agent: It is only partially, partially allocated or it can be fully. allocated. Now in this environment, there's actually also the option for no allocation, which means that we have harvested something, but it wasn't sold.
Agent: I don't know if that is actually ever going to happen in your
Speaker 5: Your
Agent: Company but hopefully not. Yeah but there is one more status that is possible and that is the no elevation that would mean that of the [QUANTITY-19] still 81 are unallocated but let's hope that it doesn't happen.
Agent: The next thing that this ties into is your inventory. And you can see that there is an inventory record related over here on the batch.
Agent: And if we click on that, and I will do that now, we get some information about the inventory with the number 0001. And we can see that this is for the product called raw material type one.
Agent: And it does some calculations based on the information that we have of the batches and the batch allocations.
Agent: You can see that there's a total of eight batches in the system currently that Total to the amount of [QUANTITY-8]. You can also see them Specified over here.
Agent: These are the eight different batches that exist within the system almost all of them harvests that either [QUANTITY-29] [QUANTITY-3] of raw material And it also does a calculation and basically tells you, but there's 424 still available because not everything has been allocated yet.
Agent: And there are in total six batches that contribute to that availability, to the availability of the [QUANTITY-21]. And you would be able to find out which batches are responsible for that.
Agent: And we'll look at our allocation status in the list of batches. is over here, where you can see that there are two fully allocated.
Agent: So those other one s that no longer have any use for us basically because it's already been sold and hopefull y at some point delivered to the customer.
Agent: But we have those no allocation and partially allocate d Six records.
Speaker 5: In total, like we see over here, tha t give us an availability
Agent: Of [QUANTITY-29].
Speaker 5: This is how you can ask a question?
Speaker 5: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 5: Imagine does the system allocate itself?
Speaker 5: No, not the way I've set it up here.
Agent: If
Speaker 5: You put orders in, then allocate
Agent: According to the inventory, for instance, or do we have to do that manually?
Agent: Well, it is. That's a question that I'll feed for and so on.
Agent: What batches to allocate first and so on?
Agent: Sure. It is something that can definitely be automated. It always depends a little bit on the number of dependencies, I guess.
Agent: Like for instance, is there something that identifies a patch as needing to be used first before Would that just be the patch number or is there some other element that makes it so that one patch should be used up for the other one Maybe things Thanks Yeah, absolutely That makes sense The thing is, is that we can definitely look at automating that, but it might also be useful to, in th e beginnings start with doing it manuall y.
Speaker 3: Another patch
Agent: So when you create an order, you create a [ORG-8] h. make that match allocation something that you do manually, so that you can find out what it is that you are missing there, and then eventually automated.
Agent: I'm not saying that we don't want to automate it in the beginning, we definitely can, but it is something that you need to make a decision on.
Agent: It becomes a bit complex, and it requires quite some configuration to do that allocation
Speaker 5: Automatically, but it's definitely possible. Yeah, but okay, yeah, hopefully we don't have that large inventory, but in case we end up with a larger inventory, then at least that proposal for a location could be helpful.
Speaker 5: Because it's not only the date you would say, it's fine, we have the date, but a left or exactly matching the we might take it even though it's new ones.
Agent: If we have
Agent: Side all, then
Speaker 5: So it is more the
Agent: Various
Agent: Things to consider when we are. allocate the batches.
Agent: I think [PERSON-2] with what we can help you guys a lot with is the abilit y two foresee let's say whatever is going to remain of a batch and obviously it's a natural product s o I can imagine it' s It's always there's some the 65 and might be 101 or 65.
Speaker 5: Discrepancy between
Agent: Like [PERSON-15] mentioned, we can always. But my suggestion would also be start manually, but after that, we could say, let's up.
Agent: All right, set up rules like if product X remains from previous batch, please allocate first before we start the new batch that definitely can be done. But I think we need to.
Agent: Learn a bit ourselves or from outside of this.
Agent: In this case you guys
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-8], you're looking looking at the time I think we're almost done you think so?
Agent: In terms of the
Agent: But I would like to add if you be sort of kind to [PERSON-8] to open
Agent: Up a batch, let's say B-B002 for example.
Agent: Yeah, I can do that over here.
Agent: If you look what we've discussed very briefly with [GPE-1], [PERSON-2], what happens if there is a customer coming back with, say, a remark or a complaint about a certain batch?
Speaker 5: Is there a process in place?
Speaker 5: Or?
Speaker 5: Yeah, that would be a.
Speaker 5: Reclamation process that was that was not up. First it will go to [GPE-1].
Speaker 5: All recommendations will go to the to the to the [ORG-1] and then she would then contact us with the information we will ask my maybe for further information we need to make an assessment [TIME-6].
Agent: Very fast whether within
Speaker 5: Whether we have to recall the things and so on. This process, what happens in case of
Agent: Would be a fully described
Agent: Some complaints from [PERSON-8], do you have cases open?
Agent: The customs. Yeah.
Agent: But these are cases open.
Agent: The way it is set up in directly related to Because of the order.
Agent: The demo organization, that is a case is not a batch, but to an order.
Agent: I think what we can do, I can also just talk you guys through. Like you see on the top right, we see cases. And a case is basically or a remark or whatever.
Agent: A service request
Agent: You start an object, let's say, a case, your question about the order.
Agent: And this case can then be related to a specific order or a specific badge, which also means that in terms of let's say meeting, I'm obviously not an expert in the legal requirements you guys have in your industry.
Agent: But what we see from a lot of other customers, for example, in just in the food sector, that you link this to a particular order.
Agent: And then obviously we can help you guys identify, okay, this particular or this case is related to this order that was this badge.
Agent: Let's say within [TIME-7] you can inform all your customers and then you can also follow [ORG-29] and communicate maybe with the quality department on this particular case and I think that's fo r quite some companies there you have like the [ORG-21] checks and whatever to see you .
Agent: This is fully [ORG-21] proof, which you set it up correctly. I think that's maybe a quick remark running out of time.
Speaker 5: At the end, but we're
Agent: The only difference we fully cover
Agent: Is What we have read, sorry for it to go over. It's very good that you mentioned this. I opened a case that we have set up in the system.
Agent: I just want to show you the different relationships You can see that it is related to an account.
Speaker 4: That this has.
Agent: And to a specific order, which means that if we go to this account. And we click on case it's over here. we can see this case.
Agent: So, and multiple cases could be shown here, obviously, if they have long more cases with you. And the same actually goes for the order.
Agent: And I don't know if I've actually put it on the page lab, but we'll check it is related to this order 81.
Agent: And if I go to relate it over here, and it could also be a separate app called cases, and we go down a little bit, you can see that the case is there related as well.
Agent: So, and what why this is helpful is that because it will.
Agent: Relates to this order, you are now able to take a look at the best allocations to see which two batches are involved with this order, namely And that's why I didn't relate it, at least in this or to a specific batch, because it could be that your order comes from two different batches But the same applies, I guess, the relationship can be made, and those cases can be logged quite easily .
Speaker 3: Two and three.
Agent: So very good addition to one last thing that I wanted to show I believe is just a tiny bit about reporting and dashboarding if I report here.
Agent: I want to show you that I have created a quick report that is orders by product.
Agent: And we already in the home screen saw a we actually saw this graph shown there, but that actually takes you to this report.
Agent: And this report basically just says for all the products that we have in the system, which orders exist, you can see raw
Agent: Material type one has these five orders and raw material type two has this order over here. This can do. use on a dashboard for this .
Agent: Think if I look at this for you or [PERSON-2], maybe you can have [DATE-29] of you r setup, let's say a dashboard or a report that just show me all orders per week or sho w me all orders per product per week or show me all unallocated products [DATE-29] .
Speaker 5: For
Agent: I think you guys report on and build you guys in the dashboard
Agent: All understand whatever we can Yeah, look again. I would kindly ask you to Stop sharing my screen stop sharing your screen. I can do that. No problem. Thank you.
Agent: Um, I think Looking at everyone's input that it was a pretty positive demo
Speaker 3: Carlina What's your thoughts did we?
Speaker 3: Did we meet our expectations?
Speaker 3: So to say. Yeah, thanks. So you put everything that we will discuss to show the possibilities that can be there for us, for your systems.
Speaker 3: And you covered all the main parts that we were kind of concerned about the batch number, the recall, and then also, like the customization options are available. That's quite nice.
Speaker 3: You can try the order status, which was also important for my part. So from my center, it was
Speaker 5: Also for commercial, I think, I had all the all the things that they wanted to. the seat . Thank you. [PERSON-2], looking at you. Yeah, the same here. The issue is of course the recall for me.
Speaker 5: It's very important, both of course to have the orders for practical reasons, of course.
Speaker 5: What are we going to produce and to whom?
Speaker 5: But it's really important for me to be able to follow everything on the bets level.
Speaker 5: The order level is not that important to me, of course it is, but on the bets we need to have this traceability forward and back again in case we need again, because we.
Agent: Level, especially
Agent: To get it back
Speaker 5: We have an order of [QUANTITY-8], the main issue for me is which bats is not really which order is.
Agent: So the connection is very, very important there.
Agent: So we can both trace on orders, but also on bats level.
Speaker 4: Yep. All right. Thanks, from you or for who, or [PERSON-2].
Agent: Any input [PERSON-6]?
Speaker 4: Yeah, any time I have a question you already explained it, so it's pretty good actually. All right. And I think I noticed
Agent: Is that when you click. something immediately lost. You don't have to wait and I like that. I think that's also something I love in working in [ORG-1]. Obviously, it's quite biased, but it's fast.
Agent: And I think it's super intuitive because you might not have noticed it, but you never get stuck in [ORG-1] saying there's no end of the line because every time you reach an order or a batch [LAW-1] or whatever, there's always the possibility of going back to that order or customer as linked to which makes it super into like we're not the most <inaudible> to available.
Agent: But we are very pleasant t o work with.
Agent: I think, um, [GPE-1], um, I think it's good that, uh, if you can stay on the call for [TIME-8], then I'm gonna ask [PERSON-6], [PERSON-6] for the [PERSON-2] thing them for their input because, um, I think it was pretty positive.
Agent: I'm also happy, uh, [PERSON-2] that we met your expectations, uh, and needs. Um, and I think it's gonna help you guys, uh, forward, um, But for now, I only have practical [PRODUCT-3] and I think [PERSON-2], you're day.
Agent: Stuff left
Speaker 5: To discuss with needed [DATE-32], every
Agent: Thanks a lot for the time. I've put them in [PERSON-6] as well. [PERSON-6], if there's any thoughts or questions, let's say IT perspective, you don't hesitate to reach out to us directly for your input.
Speaker 4: From an
Speaker 4: And yeah, looking
Speaker 6: Forward to
Speaker 5: Taking this to the next step
Agent: With you
Speaker 3: Guys. Thanks, [PERSON-10]. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the time. See you guys. [PERSON-18].
Speaker 3: All right. I think it was pretty good. I think so.
Agent: We
Agent: Had a minor mental,
Agent: Let's stop recording. You had a minor mental breakdown. Where we started.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if there were opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers' needs. The sales rep asked several questions and sought feedback throughout the demo, indicating an effort to understand the customers' needs. However, without more context or information about the customers' specific needs and requirements, it is not possible to definitively say if there were missed opportunities for further understanding.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, it appears that the customer had a positive impression of the seller's product. They expressed satisfaction with how the product addresses their concerns about batch number, recall, and customization options. The customer also appreciated the order status feature and the ability to trace orders and batches at various levels. However, the customer did not explicitly state that the product meets all their needs.

Answer to this question is: It seems likely, but it is not explicitly stated in the transcript.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""What is your small question here?"" (Speaker 3, line 152)
2. ""So when the country is signed, we have like a PDF version of signed contract, if it will be done outside of the [ORG-1], upload the contract to the system or the store, can you store it basically in there?"" (Speaker 3, line 221)
3. ""What we've done on this order, we have basically added order products, which means, again, here we have that raw material type one. Sorry for that pop up and we have said we need [QUANTITY-6] of that and the unit price over here is [QUANTITY-8]. So, let's go down to the details section, we can see that the order placed is the status that's the same as what we see over here. We can see that the order amount is for [MONEY-2]. That's because Euros per kilogram times [QUANTITY-6] gets up a steady amount . There's a whole lot of other information that we don't store on this particular order right here, but that you could choose to store."" (Agent, line 240)
4. ""What batches to allocate first and so on?"" (Agent, line 305)
5. ""What we can do, I can also just talk you guys through. Like you see on the top right, we see cases. And a case is basically or a remark or whatever. A service request you start an object, let's say, a case, your question about the order."" (Agent, line 331)

These questions help the sales rep understand the customer's needs and requirements better, which can be used to tailor the sales pitch and address the customer's pain points.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were:

1. The ability to customize the order process according to individual order types and customer requirements.
2. The possibility of integrating with their existing tools, such as [NORP-2] for dashboards and reporting finances.
3. Storing signed contracts within the system and managing the storage limits.
4. The recall process and how the system handles complaints or issues related to specific batches.

The customer emphasized the importance of traceability, especially on the batch level, to ensure they can follow everything backward and forward in case of recalls. They also appreciated the system's speed and intuitiveness.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call appears to be positive. They expressed that their expectations were met and they were pleased with the system's capabilities, particularly in terms of batch traceability, order status, and customization options. They also appreciated the intuitive interface and the speed of the system. However, they did mention some practical matters that needed to be discussed further. Overall, the call seemed to bring them closer to a positive decision regarding the deal.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person if they were not. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call."
video_19774_167_6qr3y000000g2poAAA,"Agent: I'm [PERSON-1]
Speaker 6: [PERSON-2]. I am the supervisor for [ORG-1]'s school program. I currently have a team of five people who work under me and my team serves veterans who are at risk of homelessness throughout the state of [GPE-1].
Speaker 6: And we help them obtain [ORG-2] disability benefits. So we work collaboratively with other agencies. We, have a really lengthy application process because we also go through appeals.
Speaker 6: There's a lot of documentation involved which we'll talk about later for our work. I've been with the agency a little bit over [DATE-1] at this point.
Speaker 6: Finding a case management system that was going to be efficient and effective for the type of work that we're doing was one of my first priorities when I inherited the team. [PERSON-3], you can go right ahead.
Speaker 7: Morning everyone or [TIME-1], depending on where you're at. My name is [PERSON-4] on [ORG-3] on [PERSON-5]'s team. I've been with the agency for about seven, seven and a half months now.
Speaker 7: You know, probably my focus is case management and supporting veterans throughout the [ORG-2] application process. But I also work with veterans throughout the appeals process and we'll be representing them at the hearing level.
Speaker 7: A little bit about my background. I spent [DATE-2] in [ORG-4]. Did a lot of fun stuff in a lot of different places.
Speaker 7: Even down a little bit in the software sales world for [DATE-3]. I worked at [ORG-5] selling all kinds of fun stuff until I finally came to my census.
Speaker 7: No offense and ended up here at [ORG-6]. No offense he's going to grab it.
Agent: Taken. I worked for [ORG-5] as well. So commercial sector.
Speaker 7: The <inaudible> star is what we used to call it.
Agent: Yep. Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: Grommute, [PERSON-6].
Agent: Sorry, I didn't hear earlier because we were getting some feedback from you.
Agent: I keep trying to make that feedback. [DATE-4] was brain headphones and we were getting to not do that [DATE-5].
Agent: Robot noise, so I'm trying
Agent: Thank you guys for your introduction. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you.
Agent: What we'd like to start with is giving us an overview of your process, what you do every day, how you interact with the SOAR program and the things that we need to talk about and know for being able to implement this with you on [ORG-7].
Speaker 6: Sure, I can handle that. So our day is generally dictated by the referrals that we receive, as well as the claims that we are actively working on.
Speaker 6: So every, yeah, so we receive referrals from a couple of different avenues. Maybe this was talked about before, but we have a. a telephone service called [ORG-8].
Speaker 6: And so [ORG-8] is [ORG-9] specific to basically screen people who call in and ask for help.
Speaker 6: And then if they determine that [ORG-10] is a program that might be able to help a veteran, then a referral is made through LinkFET that ends up on a [ORG-11] right now for us.
Speaker 6: So then we have a [ORG-11] referral list that we work through to call and screen people who are interested in our program. We fill out an intake worksheet that takes all the basic general information about a person.
Speaker 6: Use that to document the conversation that we have with them and to document that [ORG-9] e gone through all of the privacy warnings that are required in order for us to collect informatio n on their behalf to make a determination.
Speaker 6: So we generally have a list that comes throug h and that's something that we're working every day . We also have referrals that come in through another [ORG-11] site called the homeless veteran registry.
Speaker 6: And so we get those via email at this point and then we load those into our [ORG-11].
Speaker 6: Right now [ORG-11] is our source of truth that we go back to make sure that we are tracking every person that we come in contact with. From there, people are working on claims.
Speaker 6: So once a person has been approved for our services, then that individual is going to be assigned to a caseworker. And that caseworker is going to start the application process with the individual.
Speaker 6: And so when we're doing that, we're collecting DD-234, which is the discharge paperwork.
Speaker 6: We are going to- be collecting some, we have to prepare documents to take out on an application visit So we have, you know, a printed privacy warning We have social [ORG-13] forms that we have to fill out prior to an application appointment We have Medical ROIs that need to be completed So we try to prep all of that paperwork prior to our visit with the veteran And then the visit is going to be in person where we complete an online application through the [ORG-2] website in most case s. There are a lot of things that are documented as we're going through the application process.
Speaker 6: And let me know if this is too, if this is too in the weeds, I don't know much about all of this so. This is perfect. Okay. Thank you. Please. Okay.
Speaker 6: So when we meet in person with the veteran, we are, we're going to be doing that online application. There are specific forms in the online application that we that we store for our record keeping purposes.
Speaker 6: And so some examples might be. might be screenshots from an application or we have PDFs that we keep as we go through the application process so that we can refer back to that. We also keep case notes regularly.
Speaker 6: So once we've created a case for a claim that we're working on, every telephone call, every email, everything, even our travel plans are all stored right now currently in one note. Basically, that's a part of our processes.
Speaker 6: We have to keep notes on every conversation that we have with people. So that would include when we're in the application appointment as well.
Speaker 6: We may have some case notes that we're keeping just to just to keep notes about conversations that we've had with the veteran things that we need to follow up on after that appointment.
Speaker 6: Once we've Once we've had all of those signed forms completed, we come back to the office and we scan and store those documents for future use, because we will have We will have [ORG-14] records requests that we have to send out to each facility that the veteran has been to.
Speaker 6: And that will compile a couple of different forms at some point, so including the facility specific ROI, our representation forms, a [ORG-14] release form from [ORG-14], and a letter that we attach to the top of that.
Speaker 6: To the top of that release. Once we have started the application, we've submitted to [ORG-14], there are several things that have to happen along the application path.
Speaker 6: We need to follow up with [ORG-2] to make sure they get the signed application. There is a fact that we sent to SSA.
Speaker 6: We also have forms that will need to be sent to the state agency that makes the [ORG-14] decision. That's the disability determination.
Speaker 6: They send us mail as well, including a fax barcode so that we can send documents directly to them electronically And then generally what happens with that application is that our job is to just follow the case to store every letter that we receive from [ORG-2] or [ORG-14] We want to make sure that we don't have a stagnant case.
Speaker 6: So what I would be looking for The thing that we are doing manually at this point is scheduling out those follow-ups that need to happ en to make sure that the case is moving along at within a certain time fram e. And then we follow it to a decision.
Speaker 6: So once that decision is made, there's some paperwork that we have to do to prepare for submitting documents to get reimbursement from [ORG-14].
Speaker 6: There's some reporting that we do through a website through [ORG-14] as well. And then if it turns into a denial, then that denial could lead to an appeal. And then there's a problem.
Speaker 6: That we go through for the first level of appeal, which is a request for reconsideration which generally takes about four two six months . And then a request for a hearing which could take [DATE-6].
Speaker 6: So those each have their own paperwork involved. Some of it is over overlapping, but a lot of it is new, especially at that hearing level. Other things that we, we may come across.
Speaker 6: We, each of my reps have a continuum of care that they're assigned to. They have a biweekly meeting that they attend, where we may be discussing cases that are within that region of the state.
Speaker 6: And so people may be taking notes on that or collecting referrals from that meeting. And then we also have regular Outreach to other organizations.
Speaker 6: This would be really like down the road, maybe not a part of this current project, but we also have other projects that we work on, especially a [PERSON-3] and myself, that would be more about community partner outreach.
Speaker 6: But isn't necessarily a part of the claims path that we're looking at for for this current project with [ORG-14] Wars. Got it.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-3], else to add to that?
Speaker 7: Did you have anything
Speaker 7: I just say that, you know, everything at a high level, everything we do is manual. There's no automation built into our process really anywhere.
Speaker 7: And the lack of Integration requires us to duplicate our effort in different systems that we're using whether it's SharePoint one note. Some of us even use the good old fashioned [PRODUCT-1] called [ORG-25].
Speaker 7: So when you have data sitting in a lot of different places and you're working anywhere from 25 to 17 cases at a time.
Speaker 7: What we're looking for is someone who's a you know from a case worker in case management perspective, something that streamlines what I do, I'm looking for a way to make my job easier to eliminate the burden of having to over-admitstrate and over-manage everything I do or manage it from my own memory.
Speaker 7: And really, I mean, like I said, at a high level, [PERSON-5], that's pretty much what I'd add. I'd be happy to go into specifics if you want to
Agent: Feel my pain at some point, but I'll just keep that for now. Unfortunately, your pain is not new to us.
Agent: So because we work in this space, we know we talked to case managers [DATE-7], you know, all day every day that have very similar pain points. So if it's any.
Agent: Consolation, which I'm guessing it's not you're not alone and we know we can make huge improvements
Agent: With [ORG-7]. So.
Agent: Okay, I think you had a question for now earlier.
Agent: Did you want to ask that?
Agent: I did. I was wondering. So when you're taking that intake packet, essentially, when you're going to that first in person meeting. Would it make sense to like if that.
Agent: I'm wondering how much of a priority it is if that packet could be generated for you and would have the individual's name, social all those things you could easily transpose numbers.
Speaker 6: Security number,
Agent: So you could click a button and say, hey, print this packet.
Agent: I'm guessing that once you take it, it's going to probably be because you're gonna be filling things out in pen, and they're gonna probably have to wet sign it, right?
Speaker 6: Pdf'd and scanned
Agent: Correct, yeah. basic information on all those forms .
Speaker 6: That you already have on them pre-filled your caseworkers a Absolutely.
Agent: I'm guessing that could save significant amount of time.
Speaker 6: Just the basic information.
Speaker 6: And the applicant, right?
Speaker 6: Yes. That you're trying to help. OK. We take a lot of time right now to prepare that paperwork on our own.
Speaker 6: But if there's any way to at least get the basic information into all of these forms, including the ROIs, I think that would be really helpful. There are specific fields that are going to be specific to a case.
Speaker 6: Like the dates that we need for, for the date range for the [ORG-14] records and things like that. But there are, you know, I would say there are a handful of facilities that we see quite frequently,
Agent: That if we had the ability to just check a box saying, hey, yes, and it would be pre-populated, that us a lot of time.
Speaker 6: I need to print this form would be really nice and it would save
Agent: Okay, and then you could check the boxes.
Agent: Did they could sign the thing and then if you needed to scan and upload them?
Agent: Exactly. Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you for figured there was an, you know,
Speaker 6: Clarifying that. I
Speaker 7: It's, we want to go far enough to help, but not too far that it becomes overly complicated or, you know, so Right.
Speaker 7: Well, [PERSON-1], I would say that the information that we collected an intake or screening is is all we need to generate a or an 1007.
Speaker 7: So we can capture that administrative data, how's it there?
Speaker 7: And then to your point, [PERSON-7], just click a button and have all that data auto-populate
Speaker 6: And
Agent: Give us that. As someone who's hunting and pecking,
Speaker 6: That would be hugely helpful at the time saving capacity.
Agent: I'm a poor typist, so I always look for those opportunities. Yeah. Thank you guys. That is a ton of great information for us. I'm going to kind of pick through what I heard and ask some additional questions.
Agent: So, how I'm going to start with where you started, where you receive referrals from link that that's a phone screening service that already exists.
Speaker 6: And do those people need access to the [ORG-7] system?
Speaker 6: Would they be information in there?
Agent: Tracking
Speaker 6: Or do they more just send you referrals from there?
Speaker 6: I think they would have very limited access even right now with our [ORG-11]. They don't have the ability to to change anything that is already in our [ORG-11]. They can only add referrals through our [ORG-11].
Speaker 6: The same thing with [ORG-21]. They have access to our [ORG-11], but all that they can do is add and then and then view cases.
Speaker 6: I don't know at a high level what the plan is from [PERSON-8]'s perspective about whether they still want those referrals to come to [ORG-11] and then those show up in [ORG-7] or if the goal is to get those into [ORG-7] only.
Speaker 6: I'm not sure exactly what his plan is. But as of right now, the [ORG-11] capacity is very limited.
Agent: They can only add to the [ORG-11]. Okay. So if we were to talk about a, maybe a customer they needed edit those kind of things that might eat sense for your team there.
Speaker 6: Portal where they could log in and see the information and add, but not to lead or, you know, Exactly.
Agent: In talking about the screening and intake worksheets. Those are things you guys, your team is filling out correct as you're working with those user those veterans and we want to. make those into forms online that
Speaker 6: You can fill out the field,
Agent: Put the data into sales horse right away instead of filling out a form, as long as we can generate that knowing that sometimes you need that actual document.
Speaker 6: Into a document, if needed, Okay.
Agent: Great. In the intake part, we're collecting data on the veteran specifically.
Agent: Are we collecting information on programs as well?
Speaker 6: That they might be interested in or just their information and then it goes through the screening process. Usually it's just their information.
Speaker 6: We if we determine that they're not eligible for our services, then there's a possibility that we'd be, we would be making a referral to another provider. But okay, the purpose of the take sheet
Agent: Is just for us to determine if they're eligible for our program. Okay.
Agent: And, [PERSON-7], did you have a question?
Agent: I just wondered if you're also collecting information family members and
Agent: On in time, I'm sure
Speaker 6: That's great. We're going [PERSON-6] though.
Speaker 7: Is exactly where I was going. Yes. So we're using.
Agent: Using that we're
Speaker 7: Yeah, that would be great for us to see those data points that you're collecting. Okay. Sure. Thank you. [PERSON-5], I can.
Speaker 6: I've got there, and then I'll just
Agent: Send an email to him. Okay. Perfect.
Agent: So the screening process, is this something that is done manually?
Agent: Is it a, um, not drawing the right word, but is it a calculation of points that we that many people go personal reviewing the document
Speaker 7: Through, or is it more of a
Speaker 6: And reviewing the information and deciding if they move to the next step?
Speaker 6: Yeah. So what we do. What we do is we have a person assigned by a terminal digits and that person calls the individual and goes through the screening on that intake worksheet.
Speaker 6: So they collect all the data, they collect the proof of veteran status, make sure that they have all the information that they need.
Speaker 6: And then we have a team sync twice a week where we go over all of the information on the intake worksheet.
Speaker 6: And that's the point where we determin e whether they're going to be eligible or not And then the person who's taking the [PERSON-9] e assigned
Agent: To that meeting .
Speaker 6: So you did reference that meeting that you take and assign cases from there.
Agent: A lot of notes there Is it?
Agent: I just want to make sure we're collecting the right information for you on the screening process.
Agent: Is do you need to collect like [PERSON-1] your responses and notes and then chucks responses and notes separate as individual sets or do you guys kind of come to an agreement and then put that set of notes
Speaker 6: In and say yes they're eligible or no they're not. Right now we just have one field for that. So the person who is presenting the case, we just put in the notes after we discuss what my decision was.
Speaker 6: And then that was stolen
Agent: In that in-time worksheet. Yeah. Totally makes sense. I just know that sometimes they need to keep all of the people's individual notes as they're talking through screening. So that makes sense to me.
Agent: Okay, so we talked about screening and intake. There's privacy warning documents that you share with them and talk about as you're going through the phone with them. Make sure we collect the data.
Agent: The documents that they need to submit are is there a. them.
Speaker 6: Online portal that they're submitting email them to you?
Agent: Did they
Speaker 6: Do they bring them into the office?
Speaker 6: Do you collect them when you're talking to them?
Speaker 6: Yeah, that was actually a thing that we talked about initially when we talked to [ORG-7]. We don't have a good way for them to get documents to us.
Speaker 6: Usually they email, but that is a concern for terms of their private information being sent via an unsecured.
Agent: Me in
Speaker 6: Sometimes they will have a CVSO who can send an encrypted email to us or a fax, but a lot of times people are emailing or mailing their documents to us.
Speaker 6: My preference would be to have the portal for people to use once they're working with us so that they
Agent: Can securely
Agent: Send those documents.
Agent: Do you, is access to technology a concern there?
Agent: Do you feel that if people have the portal that they'll be able to utilize it and have the both the hardware, the access to an actual computer to be And then
Speaker 6: Able to do that?
Speaker 7: We can make it very simple, but knowing that And everyone that we work with generally has a cell phone.
Agent: These are people in crisis.
Speaker 7: Okay.
Speaker 6: Smartphone, I should say. They generally, all of them that I've worked with have Or they got a post manager who could help them get the documentation to us.
Agent: Smartphones.
Speaker 6: Got it. Okay. And unfortunately, they're working with one of our community partners who has already
Agent: Streamed them for their veteran status and can send us the documentation that we need.
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: But hearing that from [PERSON-3], we would want to make sure that friendly
Speaker 6: The site is mobile for mobile devices, smartphones so that they can easily upload.
Agent: Yeah. Great.
Agent: Okay, so then the next thing you talked about was the homeless veterans registry and you're getting emails from that and those get entered into [ORG-11]. Is this another manual process where someone receives those emails, opens them, enters that.
Agent: Okay. So getting that information from [ORG-17], is there a possible Integration that could happen where they could send the data directly into the system or do we think that it would need to stay emails.
Speaker 6: I would love if we were able to integrate the homeless veteran registry with the [ORG-25] system as well. I think that that's a place where we could definitely look at in the future.
Speaker 6: I think right now our SOR system is up first. I don't know when along the line the [ORG-23] would be, but I think that would be a good long range plan.
Speaker 6: Because they have a lot of the same information. Sure, sure.
Agent: And [ORG-7] does offer things like if emails are coming in, you could do quickly create an email to case that would create a case for you and enter some of that data in so that it's at least in the system to start with.
Agent: So we could talk about that not as a full integration, but maybe as another way for something that's already happening for you to benefit in the system.
Agent: Okay, so we moved to claims. So then we are talking about people who have been approved for services.
Agent: And it's gone through your review and screening process and assigned to the case worker and then they start an application process and I wrote down D234 the discharge is that the application discharge that they're filling out.
Agent: That's their military discharge form that they get. That's a very important piece of paper for a veteran to get says important as their drivers license and social Security card probably. That's what that.
Agent: They need to provide this application
Agent: Yep, as part of process.
Speaker 6: Thank you. Okay. And then. Thank you.
Agent: So what are we?
Agent: I'm sorry. Getting caught up with myself here. So you said start the application process. You might start the application process for the [ORG-2] application.
Speaker 6: That correct?
Speaker 6: Yes. Okay. Yes.
Agent: Okay. And you do that. You said prepare for the application visit.
Agent: That was where [PERSON-7] was talking about putting data into those documents so we can help you print that packet and the letter and populate all of that information to make that as easy as possible.
Agent: Those are always done as a site visit or do.
Speaker 6: Or in person you said so maybe they come to you or you know to them. Almost always we meet with them in person to go through that online application.
Agent: And you're taking that packet and you're filling out the information there, having them sign it and send it in. Okay.
Agent: Would it make it easier or more complicated for you to fill out that information maybe on a mobile tablet or something like that?
Speaker 6: Or do you think it's just adding to that process?
Speaker 6: Yeah, I don't think we would want to do that.
Speaker 6: We have the capacity we'll need with them to we have a duplicate monitor that we can use so that they can see the information that we're filling out on their forms. So I think with our laptops were fine.
Agent: We don't need to add anything more to your process. We want to make it better for you.
Agent: So as your dream, I'm not a I guess that's something new from I assume that the when you talked about printing the forms, I thought all most of the forms were paper that you were going through them.
Speaker 7: [ORG-17] [DATE-5].
Speaker 6: So you're, you are
Agent: Printing the forms, but then you're, through the social [ORG-13] application.
Speaker 7: You're going application.
Agent: The actual
Speaker 7: The actual. Yep. Okay. It's, it's an online application at the SSA site.
Agent: That's hosted [PRODUCT-2]. All right. Thanks. We do it online. Yeah.
Agent: Thanks for clarifying. Thank you. And as you've, oh, hang on, I'll come right back to that. I just want to make sure I'm understanding I've covered everything here.
Agent: The discharge repers, the documents, so they give you any additional documents that they may need to submit at that time. And you're Okay.
Speaker 6: Going to take them back and scan them with the application.
Agent: So, documents, screenshots, PDFs, case notes, those are all things that you're taking as you're working through that visit. And then again, we need to get them into the system after that. including your travel plans and all of those.
Agent: Okay [PERSON-10] already asked the question about wet signatures, so we don't need an e-signature tool because you need
Speaker 6: To have those signed . Okay,
Agent: Yes.
Speaker 7: And a release letter we talked about and then. Well, I just want to interrupt, [PERSON-5], the 696 and the 2360 don't necessarily well, do they have to be.
Speaker 6: We're going to do a web site because doing the.
Speaker 7: I know they're
Speaker 6: The 13, the 1421 is through [ORG-14] is portal. Okay. So you, it's through [ORG-17] sign, but it's
Speaker 7: Already set up there that they don't have to have any additional software to do.
Agent: Okay. Perfect. So that is the visit. And you are meeting with the person you're filling out the information you're helping them start that application [ORG-25].
Speaker 6: And. getting it submitted to
Agent: Then you need to really track that application process and what stage it's in and that kind of stuff.
Agent: So is that you guys going reminders, of course, but is that your team going to [ORG-25] site, looking
Speaker 6: Them up for, do you get data back from them as to status?
Speaker 6: Usually, if we're making follow-ups, we're going to do those follow-ups by phone.
Speaker 6: And then, we will be informed once the case has been sent to [ORG-14], because they will send us a letter saying that they are the person working on the case, and there's their contact information.
Speaker 6: And at that point, we get the barcode and some forms that they're requesting from us.
Speaker 6: But typically, we have to call if we want to check the status of, to verify that they have assigned application, that they received our representation forms, and that they don't need
Agent: Any additional information from us, of course. Okay. So we want to be able to track those notes that you're taking as you're talking to them when you called, and then the status being able to see the application.
Speaker 6: Move through those statuses
Agent: In the system. Right.
Agent: Are there any regulations that you need to make sure you're meeting like once it's submitted [DATE-8], it has to move to this stage or you know any of those kind of things that we might need
Speaker 6: Be able to help send reminders or help tracks that be done by this time kind of thing.
Speaker 6: And this is this is something that I definitely wanted to talk about in terms of sustainability with my team is, you know, right now [ORG-25] is running a lot slower. were, then they had pre-pandemic .
Speaker 6: Lost a lot of staff and things are just taking longer .
Speaker 6: But I was wondering if that's something that has taken into consideration about how flexible can we be about those time frames?
Agent: If
Speaker 6: Things do start moving a little bit faster, as an admin, can I go in and change when those reminders need to be sent out easily?
Speaker 6: Because that's something I think would be really helpful for us as as both [ORG-2] and
Agent: The state's Medical agency are working on those. I would definitely want to be able to make these changes as they come. Absolutely. [ORG-7] is great about that. It's very easy to make those changes and will
Speaker 7: Help you as we're changing with your team on how to adjust those as you need to. So, yeah, please.
Speaker 7: And this may be kind of going to step back in the process, but we're talking about the in-person of the things that came up in conversation [TIME-2] with [PERSON-11], it was the ability to automate reminders and set those out to the veteran.
Speaker 6: Meeting. One
Speaker 7: If it's going to be an in-person meeting [TIME-3] in advance or even like [TIME-4] that morning. to send an email or the ability to send a text message because they generally respond more actively to text messages.
Speaker 7: So would we be able to create an auto reminder that would go out next number of [TIME-5] prior to the actual meeting by a text that says, hey, this is [PERSON-9].
Agent: Just wanted to remind you, we have this meeting [DATE-5]. If you can't make it, you know, please call, etc. Absolutely.
Agent: We can definitely do that reminders to your team for things that may happen, but also to those veterans that for those visits that are scheduled time-based reminders of something salesforce does very well,
Speaker 6: Be it hours or days, you know, and
Agent: We can track that amount of time as well because we're day stamping everything to make sure that we're tracking those.
Agent: All right, so we can do a lot with reminders and assistance to the veterans as well as to your team.
Agent: Just looking back through my notes, we were talking about signed forms.
Agent: [PERSON-7], did you have a question?
Agent: Yeah, while we're on the in-person meeting again and back to that, when, you know, I know that you're taking your notes and your case notes, and this is probably true of, you know, similar lead to any interaction you're having with the [ORG-14] or the veteran themselves, but When you're doing that, are you also tracking
Speaker 6: The time that you're spending and or mileage?
Speaker 6: You talked about travel plans. Is that
Agent: Important for your reimbursement?
Speaker 6: So time is not important for our reimbursement, but mileage is. We're allowed round trip mileage from our veteran service building
Agent: To wherever the veteran is located just for one visit though, but it's usually going to be that application visit.
Speaker 6: All right, anything else about the visits?
Speaker 6: This is all great information. Yeah, so at the end of the application appointment, typically we have to schedule another interview within [DATE-9], which would be over the phone.
Speaker 6: So we try to do that [DATE-10] before we leave. So we've got a time on our calendar and we verified it with a veteran that time is going to work for them.
Speaker 6: We usually let them know write it down, whatever we need to do, maybe send an email reminder. But I think it would be really nice to be able to just send an automatic email once that appointment is scheduled.
Agent: Just so that they have it, we can confirm they got it on their phone and we're set up for the next interaction. [PERSON-13]. Do you have a shared calendar that you guys all use so you can
Speaker 6: See your whole team who's going out something like that?
Speaker 6: Or are those really being tracked on your own calendars?
Agent: Whoever it would be the individual caseworker that would have Okay.
Speaker 6: To make it work with your schedule.
Agent: And do you guys use Outlook or Gmail?
Agent: Outlook. Outlook. [ORG-7] has a Salesforce Outlook Integration so it could be easy enough to pull those calendar invites right into your personal calendars. So that could help as well.
Speaker 7: And then when you schedule those meetings, there are invites like normal meetings but you could send a reminder notices and letters with those as well. I have a details question real quick.
Speaker 7: So we use soft phones by a team as our office line. And I'm assuming you guys would have an Integration to teams that would allow it to any Outreach activity that we do.
Agent: It would log in under the case notes.
Speaker 7: I do know that there is an Integration
Agent: Between sales horse and teams. I have not implemented it myself. So I don't know the details there. I don't know if [PERSON-7] does or [PERSON-14] maybe wants to talk about it for a moment.
Agent: But I know
Agent: That can be done. I have not.
Agent: Oh, sorry. I've done other soft phones, but not that one. So I'll defer to [PERSON-14].
Agent: Right, I was just going to mention that you can access various [ORG-7] records in [ORG-23], like accounts, contacts that can be pulled up in both [ORG-23] and [ORG-7].
Agent: I think it is on Roadmap for you to be able to log those conversations and do things, but, similar to [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-7], I haven't implemented that either.
Agent: But while I'm off mute, I do have a quick follow-up question. I think I might have missed this earlier, but as those referrals are coming in. Are they assigned based on capacity is it done based on like your
Agent: Or
Speaker 6: Basket area or ?
Speaker 6: County. Sure. So the initial referrals that haven't been screened yet are assigned by terminal digits. So the last two digits of the veteran's social Security number would determine who would screen them.
Speaker 6: But the actual case assignments once they have been deemed eligible for my program
Agent: Would be assigned by me. Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Agent: So you're doing case assignment for, I think you said, your caseworkers are working 25 to 25 cases at a time.
Speaker 6: How many people do you have doing that?
Speaker 6: And you're doing those all manual assignments?
Speaker 6: Oh, yeah. So I mean, the numbers can fluctuate and all of those cases are at different levels of completion. Sometimes we've sent everything in and we're just waiting for a decision.
Speaker 6: But yeah, so we have five full-time people, eventually six, that are doing cases.
Agent: And so typically for claims for that size of a team, it would be somewhere around 10 claims a week that I would be assigning. Okay. Okay.
Agent: And that could be something we talk about in the future that could help with some the auto assignment for you.
Agent: If you want to get comfortable with it and you know the process and how you're doing that but definitely something we could do based on criteria based on that term role digit you know any of those kind of things we could put into the system to help you assign that.
Agent: Thank you for calling that out [PERSON-14].
Speaker 6: All right, we were talking about visits and I think we were wrapping that up.
Speaker 6: Anything else we want to add on visits?
Speaker 7: I don't think I have anything else.
Speaker 7: Um, [PERSON-3], can you think of anything?
Speaker 7: Depends on how quickly we're able to execute the application. If we have, we usually set aside around three two three and a half hours. Um, but if we're able to.
Speaker 7: Meet with someone who's prepared, we can move through the process expeditiously, then there's usually either the function report or the work history report that we try and get knocked out.
Speaker 7: It's just it's another it's another social Security form that will collaborate to complete with the veteran. But I mean, I don't really think it's a
Speaker 7: I mean, that's I don't know. I mean, it's something that we do, but it doesn't necessarily have to be considered part of that meeting framework.
Speaker 7: If that's the way we're looking at it, because it's not anything that we're required to complete until the application moves to [ORG-17].
Speaker 7: Once it does, then it then they send out the forms to actually be hand jammed by the veteran. But we've generally completed that well in advance.
Speaker 6: Would it
Agent: Be helpful to have like, I'm sorry, [PERSON-1], to have indicators in the system of whether you've done certain of those things, kind of like a checklist?
Speaker 7: Yeah, I mean, [PERSON-5], if I'm stepping on toes here, by the way, I'm thinking about, I'm I think about [ORG-7] based on my previous experience using it as And unlike from a sales cycle process, from initiation to completion, identifying what constitutes phase one two phase two two phase three two phase four.
Agent: A [PRODUCT-1].
Speaker 7: And it's usually built around activities, specifically when the [ORG-17] barcode gets submitted out. Then we know that we're on a very specific timeline generally.
Speaker 7: And we know what activities [ORG-17] is working to complete that packet, but then what som e of the supplemental activities we have to complete . and the paperwork that we have to fill out and submit with the veteran.
Speaker 7: So there to your point, if we're able to identify what, you know, what our process phases look like and I'm sure [PERSON-5]'s got that, you know, living somewhere, but that would be an indicator or a trigger.
Speaker 7: And hey, we've moved on from this phase to this phase or we're in this step.
Speaker 6: Yeah, so what I'm thinking about with those forms that are completed prior to moving to the [ORG-14] decision phase is that we have to track completion of the forms and submission of the forms.
Speaker 6: And the submission of the forms is triggered by us receiving a letter indicating that it has moved to the disability determination service. And there is a timeline for that for us to get it submitted on time.
Speaker 6: We also have the same thing with our [ORG-14] summary report, where we need to track completion of the form and then submission of the form. Medical records are a little bit different.
Speaker 6: It would be, you know, tracking submission of our request and fulfillment of our request, right?
Speaker 6: So that is another part of that initial gathering process that we have to track.
Agent: Okay, thank you. So let's see, we talked about this and then we started talking about the process of tracking the that they're started and submitted following follow ups.
Agent: Facts and things to the agency, make sure the social Security agency, disability determination with a fax barcode.
Speaker 6: I wrote that down and I just want to make sure I understand what that meant. Oh, sure.
Speaker 6: Yeah, so when [ORG-14] receives our case, we get a cover sheet with a barcode that allows us to fax documentation directly into the [ORG-26] file that they review.
Speaker 6: So that is our first letter that we get from [ORG-14] telling us that they got our claim and that they have been assigned the case. With that comes that initial request for the work history.
Speaker 6: Function report that we've completed
Agent: Prior to that date . Okay. Thank you.
Agent: That helps me just understand when we're going with that.
Agent: Do you?
Agent: Sorry. So do you put the barcode then on those documents so when they get scanned
Speaker 6: In, they go through their ingestions. Okay, got it.
Agent: And then you need to follow that case through to a decision. And after that case has been decided, are you continuing to work with the.
Speaker 6: Veteran and their family for additional support?
Speaker 6: Yes, there are some things that can happen. I can talk about awards first. So if a claim is awarded, we need to track the claim until We have received reimbursement from [ORG-14].
Speaker 6: So some things that will happen with that is often we have one of the two claims decided first and we get that award notice.
Speaker 6: But then there is another claim for supplemental Security income that requires a review with [ORG-14]. And so we have to, we have to facilitate that review in order to get those benefits adjudicated and approved.
Speaker 6: And then we have to track that to the first. payment that they received . So sometimes it's just one claim.
Speaker 6: Sometimes it's two claims that we're tracking, but we have to make sure that those benefits that they're entitled to, we receive a formal award notice and that the first payment has been paid.
Speaker 6: And then we track the claim until we receive reimbursement from [ORG-14] for our work. And there are some documents that we have to submit with that.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: So I believe you said track that until that first payment is made How do you know that?
Speaker 6: To the veteran. Correct.
Agent: Where
Speaker 6: Do you get that information?
Speaker 6: We'll get on the letter. Generally, we would get on letters saying that they've been awarded benefits.
Speaker 6: The award notice for one of the programs will happen automatically for the most part within [DATE-11] after the [ORG-14] decision has been made. And that will show when they can expect to receive their first payment.
Speaker 6: But for the other program, they have to go through that manual review process with [ORG-2].
Speaker 6: And then when that award notice comes out, then that'll show that they've been awarded benefits or denied benefits based on their income and resources. And then it should show when they get that first paper.
Agent: So we want to be able to track that payment was received. Do we track the amount of the payment and the date
Speaker 6: It was received. Yes.
Agent: And then you also said until you guys receive reimbursement So are there multiple payments that you would want to track or just that first one for the veteran of your reimbursement.
Speaker 6: For it.
Speaker 6: And then. the receipt
Agent: Um, like, may they get a reimbursement,
Speaker 6: Uh, made the veteran get a payment [DATE-9] and you want to track that or And no, so maybe at once they Yeah, so once they have received their first back payment from SSI, we're pretty much done with that.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: Because that means like for a lot of our veterans, they're only eligible for the [ORG-2] disability insurance that they paid through their taxes and they get an SSI back pay amount for the time that they were waiting for the decision, but that's kind of the end of it With our contract obligations, we have to see both claims to completion But once they start receiving ongoing benefits, they really have to work with social [ORG-13]
Agent: To deal with any issues that come up . Okay. And then in order for you to receive your reimbursement, do we need to generate say
Speaker 6: Reports out of the system to these payments have been received or these claims or what we're processing and and that somewhere.
Speaker 6: So I need, so as a supervisor, I need to know which cases have been awarded, but we have not requested reimbursement for.
Speaker 6: So I need to know that all claims that we've submitted have been decided and we have the formal award or denial notice on those cases.
Speaker 6: And then I use that to go into a state system through [ORG-23] to request reimbursement. And I generate an invoice. that we send to them to receive a payment . Okay. Which involve the work of our administrative specialist.
Speaker 6: And what I really need to be able to do for her is to say we're requesting this money for this case.
Agent: And then she can actually create the invoice for us. Okay. And so since we have all of that data in the system with the case numbers and what we're expecting.
Agent: We could run a report for you that we pull all of that data together.
Speaker 6: And we could even help
Agent: Generate an invoice. We've already talked about document generation. That could be something easily done. If you need to do that.
Speaker 7: But we do know additional notices to, I'm, [PERSON-14], just thinking once we close out the case or once we're as a case worker, we're no longer working. We generally send a termination of Oh, sure.
Speaker 6: Representation letter.
Speaker 7: Oh, so [ORG-13] and the veteran letting them know that we are not the appointed representative of this individual. You don't mind to keep and that would easily sending us stuff.
Speaker 6: Yeah, be a template that we could, we could create. So that's again, we can auto populate that information. And then it would do the work for us mostly.
Agent: All right, so we want to be able to compile that information and help generate an invoice so that you can submit that for reimbursement.
Speaker 6: Talking
Agent: About reporting still a little bit. Are there any federal reports you have to submit in a certain format or anything like that to the federal administration that we could help generate out of this data.
Speaker 6: For reporting, you know. I have a national system that I report two for our outcomes. And there is, you know, basic information about the applicant that I would need to be able to look at.
Speaker 6: I think a dashboard would be enough to just have that information that I would generally need. But again, just reporting allowances and denials. And once all actions have been complete is something that I would be able to.
Speaker 6: At least on an online basis .
Agent: Um, can we talk a little bit about the appeal process?
Agent: You talked about a denial could lead to an appeal or request for consideration or request I believe you probably will want to track that it's in appeal, for a hearing.
Speaker 6: So
Speaker 6: What stage it's in, those kind of things, if it's going to a hearing, the hearing date, that kind of information.
Speaker 6: Right, yeah, so once we get, once we get a denial from for that claimant, we're, we try to reach out to them at least within [DATE-9] after we receive the notice to talk about the denial and to discuss with them whether they want to go to the next stage of appeal.
Speaker 6: If they choose not to, then we would close out the case.
Agent: If
Speaker 6: They choose to go through the appeal, then we have a day window that we can work on submitting an appeal for them. And then it goes through the same process, at least for the reconsideration.
Speaker 6: So we be tracking getting it to the disability determination service, submitting the forms with the [PERSON-14] that they send us, and then seeing to that, that little decision.
Agent: Would
Speaker 6: Some things that we would probably anticipate to do is if we don't get in touch with the veteran red that we would want to send them letter or have a follow-up reminder that it will populate for us so that we know that this is on my list of tasks [TIME-2].
Agent: Way
Agent: Call
Speaker 6: Because we try to reach them through that entire love, that entire appeal period.
Agent: Just to make sure that we've got these to make contact with them to figure out if we want to go to that next stage.
Agent: Thank you. That makes sense.
Agent: And then the next thing I wrote here is about your [DATE-13] meetings. You need to collect the notes add them to the system
Speaker 6: You discuss the cases and the referrals and assign out cases at that time. Anything else about those meetings that
Agent: We could help capture.
Speaker 7: It may be no.
Speaker 7: Yeah, are we that?
Speaker 6: Just talking about that?
Speaker 6: Are we just talking about
Speaker 7: Or in [PERSON-14] meetings, yes. OK, so now we have a tendency
Speaker 6: To combine the sink and the intake on [DATE-14]. Yeah.
Speaker 6: We have a [DATE-13] sink, but I think right now we're usually using teams for teams is the option that we've tried in the past to keep our meeting notes for people But I think that is sufficient
Agent: Who aren't able to attend.
Agent: At this point.
Speaker 6: I do have we have ones with each staff member. And I think a thing that would be helpful in sales forces to be able to assign tasks and individuals based what happens in meeting.
Agent: On
Speaker 6: As I'm sure you've experienced that you have a meeting with someone if you don't write it down. Within [TIME-6], you're going to have five other things to think about.
Speaker 6: I think that would be something that would be useful for me as a supervisor for that.
Speaker 6: I can assign things that are specific to a case or just things that I need to follow up on in [DATE-14] to make sure that those are complete.
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Okay. Okay.
Agent: We give you access to you.
Agent: All right, so those that covers my notes on what you were talking about, [PERSON-1], and I'm going to jump to what [PERSON-14] added for us. Really highlighting everything is manual now.
Agent: So all of these automations that we can do to help you guys be able to enter these faster more efficiently. Would be great. Talk to a little bit about a lack of integration.
Agent: You're using [PRODUCT-3] and [ORG-11] for different things. We know we can bring that data into the solution. We'll talk about data migration potentially in a moment. But are there any other system.
Agent: That you think you want to connect to the system like a true integration, bringing data i n or pushing
Speaker 6: Data t o with this system. I know they've talked about that they talked about. Integrating with [PERSON-14] for reporting. So the goal eventually is going to be that my team will be.
Speaker 6: My team's progress will be Recorded on the [PERSON-9] website through [PERSON-14]. And so that's something that I don't know if that information is going to be coming from [ORG-7] or if it's still going to be coming from [ORG-11].
Speaker 6: That's a higher level discussion that I'm not privy to, so I don't know. But I, of course, would love to have just one system that can do all of it.
Agent: So for other systems,
Speaker 6: I'm trying to think.
Agent: They're may wonky, but I always want to make sure to just ask the question.
Speaker 7: And if you think of anything later, feel free to let talk.
Speaker 6: Us know. We can always
Speaker 7: I know we talked about that we
Agent: Earlier, but did
Speaker 7: Kind of. So we use right facts to electronically fax all of our documents to whatever relative stakeholder needs them. And then.
Speaker 7: It's essentially emailed out, but we can go into right facts and retrieve anything that we've sent over time. But I don't know now that I'm thinking about it, seeing as how we just email it.
Speaker 7: It's just, I guess, our source of record-keeping for all of our facts documents because our email is scrubbed, I think, after [DATE-14]. I think outside of that rolling [DATE-14] is gone.
Agent: So there are things with [ORG-7] where you could send emails through the system and then they would be tracked within the system as well, but I don't know, you know, we would never want to supersede
Speaker 7: Any kind of regulations that you guys have so I don't want to say that.
Speaker 7: If it's something where we submit a [ORG-14] ROI to [ORG-39] on behalf of this veteran, I'm assuming the outlook Integration would track what we sent,
Agent: When we sent it to include
Speaker 7: Any attachments to that email. Yes. Then. Then that would probably be sufficient for what you need. Yeah, I mean, we still need the right facts application to be able to send facts as
Agent: Electronically, but it would prevent us from having as a record keeping source.
Speaker 7: To use a different system
Agent: And we'll look into right facts and see how it integrates with [ORG-7], you know, if there's any additional support we can bring to that, but understanding that process.
Agent: I think the outlook Integration probably would help a lot with that for you.
Agent: I'm going to move to a question of data migration. So you are storing a lot of information in [ORG-11] and [PRODUCT-3] and other places I'm sure.
Agent: Are we wanting to bring all of that into the new system?
Agent: Or any of that into the new system?
Agent: Maybe cases you're working on currently
Speaker 6: To track going forward, or but we could bring in all the historical data. That's, you know, a conversation that we need to talk about.
Speaker 6: Yeah, so I don't know how much we're actually going to need [PRODUCT-3] once we have [ORG-7].
Speaker 6: Because generally what people are using [PRODUCT-3] for at this point is to track the, to see the big picture of what needs to be accomplished for all of those loads.
Speaker 6: I think by having a list that they can filter, that's really going to help them, you know, see what's due [DATE-5] and what's upcoming in [DATE-14].
Speaker 6: Yeah, so yeah, I'm hoping that I'm hoping to be more helpful so that we have fewer things that we need to rely on.
Speaker 6: Um, I know that we are going to be moving our case files from our shared drive to [ORG-23], but I don't know if that means that we are going to try to have any of our historical cases moved into [ORG-7] or not since they're currently in [PRODUCT-4].
Speaker 6: I'm not sure. That might be something where we're just pulling the data from [ORG-11] looking at the high level
Speaker 7: Into Salesforce and we're just information. and not looking at the actual documents that were trying to store . So here's a question, [PERSON-5].
Speaker 7: If we're not going to be historical data, you said it's still just basically going to exist and it's one-note form?
Speaker 6: Migrating any of the
Speaker 7: I don't know. Oh, okay, because I'm just, again, that kind of puts us in a position where anything we have to look at behind us it's in a different or historically, system.
Speaker 6: So we're still doubling up on solutions at some point. Yeah, we only have to retain our records for [DATE-14]. And through that, those electronic records can be destroyed with the action of [ORG-23].
Speaker 6: So, records retention of the state.
Speaker 6: I've pushed that one. We've kicked that pan on the road quite a bit, so I don't have a lot of information about what that record's attention is going to look at for those one-note files.
Speaker 6: But I know we at least for [DATE-14] are going to want to be able to look back at what is currently stored at [ORG-11]. And at least have a path to get to those historical
Agent: One-note files at some point. I don't know what exactly they're going to do with those once we have [ORG-7]. Not sure.
Agent: Would it be important for those cases that are time that one note case notes?
Speaker 6: Active at the you transition for those
Agent: And I think that's probably more chocolate. Your kids are right.
Speaker 7: Yeah. Those are going to be active
Agent: Cases to somehow get
Speaker 6: Those active cases into.
Speaker 7: Yeah. I can't see.
Speaker 7: You're going to see 58 to 142, right?
Speaker 7: Based on the number. So yeah, like that transition period having to.
Speaker 6: To, you know, metal in both pools, both solutions would be, you have open rebellion. Yeah, I could see, you know, really focusing on those cases that we're actively working on getting those into, getting those into [ORG-7] for sure.
Speaker 6: And then new things that are coming in would obviously start in [ORG-7]. That would be a lot easier.
Speaker 6: But yeah, there's definitely going to be a period of time where we're going to have to do some work to get our active cases into [ORG-7]. However, we do that.
Agent: So the last question I have for you What is our timeline look like?
Speaker 6: At this point is.
Agent: Is there a compelling event this set opening
Speaker 6: That we need to have up for, you know, a next round of applications or I mean, it sounds like this is a consistent thing that you're working all year long, but are there any deadlines you kind of need or.
Speaker 6: Yeah, so in talking to [PERSON-8] about the project, his goal is that we have something that is operational for us in [ORG-7] by [DATE-14]. which [PERSON-3] tells me that's a lot.
Speaker 7: I know is
Speaker 7: But that's kind of what they're trying to shoot for is like something that we can start using.
Speaker 6: It might not have everything that but something that we can actually use as
Agent: We want, a team by. I think he used the phrase minimum viable product. Yes, yes.
Agent: So as we talk about that and what [ORG-23] might be, what functionality is most important to you?
Agent: Out of what we've talked about so far, what can
Speaker 6: Make the biggest impact to you that we could put as our priority for our [ORG-26] and then continue to work with you to get everything else in line.
Speaker 6: Yeah, I think like first and foremost, we need to have a Workflow that follows our application path.
Speaker 6: If we have our intake work sheet in there that is just a form that we fill out that pre-populates forms, that's going to help us right away.
Speaker 6: We have something that we can just drag PDFs into and it stores that for us and we don't have to put it somewhere else. That's going to be useful.
Speaker 6: I think some things a little bit later down the road.
Speaker 7: That could be
Speaker 6: If we can't get to them, we can see those auto-generated emails, go-generated But I think... ot h If we can at least get through an application and our F-holes with the bare minimum, that would be cool to us.
Agent: Texts.
Agent: So something like the portal that we talked about a little bit
Speaker 6: To allow people to upload documents that could be a second stage to your process and making it okay.
Agent: Intake
Speaker 6: Just trying to make sure I understand. Yeah what the staff really needs is that they need to.
Speaker 6: Like big picture is they come into work, they log into their computer, and they can see what they have going on [DATE-25]. Deadlines that are due or passed or coming up within a certain timeframe.
Speaker 6: And they can see the they can see what is completed for each case.
Speaker 7: In one screen, I think is really what they need. I would say enemy as a case worker is time.
Speaker 6: Our biggest
Speaker 7: So what [PERSON-5] is talking about, you know, having a dashboard or landing page. That allows us to do some triage, prioritize our activities. Instead of having to do it for memory or reviewing a calendar within.
Speaker 7: Outlook, that's one thing. I'm gonna double down on the automation aspect as a case worker. The ability to automate certain activities based on a trigger or event is going to be huge.
Speaker 7: And the ability to generate whether it's some kind of form letter, It doesn't matter.
Speaker 7: Just so long as if we check a box and it initiates that activity, that's, and then it tracks that activity within the case notes in the history.
Speaker 7: I mean, that's one click that is just eliminated the time it takes me to have separate things that could take
Speaker 6: To do three two four upwards of [TIME-7]. Yeah.
Speaker 7: I would
Speaker 6: Also say visibility is really important for me as a supervisor. And I also think it's important as we have an administrative specialist to our team.
Speaker 6: So there are some things that follow up phone calls might be a task that I would be giving to my administrative specialist. So. Her visibility on the things that are relevant to her would also be useful for us.
Speaker 6: What I don't want to have happen, and I know is happening sometimes is people are going into their cases. And they're really like digging in to figure out what they need to work on.
Speaker 6: And if they aren't in that case, they don't know that something needs to be done. It's fallen by the wayside. And I don't know if a task into a case.
Speaker 7: Has been completed unless I go I think.
Speaker 6: Yes, just automation is going to be a huge time saver. And it's going to make it a lot easier for my team to work collaboratively on projects.
Speaker 6: Because right now, one person owns their case and we really don't know what's going on unless we dig really, we take a lot of time to try to get spun up on what's going on with a veteran.
Speaker 6: Which sucks out on sick leave or somebody's vacation or whatever.
Agent: When somebody is
Speaker 6: We're really trying to make this a We're trying to use our resources to work together as a team on products
Speaker 7: So things don't get missed. But I think one of the things is to [PERSON-5]'s point, we, we as case workers generally operate in our own little silos. And within that silo, we have our individual cases.
Speaker 7: And they're trying to collaborate on some of those things gets to be kind of tough. And also becomes a point, and it's kind of a repetitive point of training. We do live training every month in person.
Speaker 7: And there are times when I think from a supervisory aspect for [PERSON-5], it would be nice to be able to pull a report on, Hey, why is it taking so long And again, it just kind of having that
Speaker 6: To hit this activity?
Agent: Visibility into the process of the entire team can facilitate that conversation about, OK, what's broken?
Agent: What do we need to adjust?
Speaker 7: So some good reporting about
Agent: How long things are in each step of a process and where that might help show where things are getting caught up and how we're assigning things out to our team. That's great.
Agent: The other thing that came to my mind when you mentioned that is, does everyone on your team, should everyone on your team same, to all the data on a case?
Speaker 6: Have access to the
Agent: Are there any restrictions?
Agent: You know, [PERSON-1] is a supervisor.
Agent: Should you see?
Speaker 6: Everything and one of your caseworkers should only see their cases but I think I heard you guys say we're trying to collaborate as a team and want to be able to see that information.
Speaker 6: Yeah I would be a little concerned about making reports available to everyone. My best experience at [ORG-14] has taught me that some people have taken too much time in [DATE-21] to be concerned about others.
Speaker 6: Not that anybody on the team now is like that but I'm thinking about the long term. So I think You know, for me to be able, I think that I would need access to everybody's work.
Speaker 6: I think that the administrative specialists would need to have access to everybody's work in order to, in order to be able to upload information into our, into sales mail that is coming in or to follow up on cases.
Speaker 6: I think that I would want to have the ability to assign work to other business workers if for some reason somebody is on emergency leave or something like. that.
Speaker 6: But I don't think that they would need to hav e all of the information on every case. I would have to think about that a little bit further.
Speaker 6: I think there's a possibility that there would be some people who would have limited access to other people's work,
Agent: And there would be some people who would have access to every.
Agent: One of the great things about [ORG-7] is you can get down to that individual field level and say [PERSON-1] can see it and [PERSON-6] can't or vice versa. So we'll really dig into that with you what they may
Speaker 7: As we help you set up your users and want to see.
Speaker 6: I need to see as we go through that process.
Agent: I have asked all of the questions I have
Speaker 7: From everything that we've
Agent: Heard today [PERSON-7], do you have anything else. I don't. I've I had and we just want to point out like we've asked you things and you don't know that's okay.
Speaker 7: Asked everything that
Agent: Once we start working together we'll have a more in-depth discovery, believe it or not, with another team.
Agent: We will certainly share all of this with them so they won't be asking again but things may have changed in the interim so they'll be clarifying that with you.
Agent: But one thing my biggest takeaway from this is is thank goodness that the veterans who need assistance have you because it sounds like this would be a really daunting thing to navigate on their own.
Agent: So I'm sure that your assistance is invaluable Yeah thank you
Speaker 6: To them and for that I'm grateful. for helping us so that we can be more useful in you know in representing them in this complicated system.
Speaker 6: Big part of it is just, you know, social [ORG-13] is like, is a beast and there are a lot of forms and there are a lot of hands in the work that we do.
Speaker 6: And we just wanna be able to make this accessible to them and we wanna be able to be accurate with the work that we're doing so that we're not forgetting somebody.
Agent: Well, I appreciate all of your time on this [DATE-17] [TIME-1]. I will go ahead and also not the Recording to everybody here. There's any additional questions. I'll start an email thread as well.
Agent: [PERSON-3], I saw your form come through already on email. So thank you for that.
Agent: And [DATE-25] we have a follow up with [PERSON-8] just to get kind of a next step forward so you get everything in a nice pretty package.
Speaker 7: In your email sure to get that all to you but I just have one quick question.
Agent: As well. So we'll make for your long weekend.
Speaker 7: I'm sorry [PERSON-25]. Oh yeah go ahead.
Speaker 7: Just to make sure, I mean, are we at a point where, you know, we're going to be I'm just thinking about how there's a lot of different stakeholders in this process, even at NDVA outside of our organization.
Speaker 7: Are you guys using anything like a joint execution plan or something that we could use to just make sure that we're hitting our benchmarks once we start getting into the nitty-gree and
Agent: The people who own certain tasks, on top of it?
Speaker 6: You know, are
Agent: Or am I just way ahead of the game here?
Agent: I think your way ahead of the game, but I love the way you're thinking.
Agent: I think that's all in the plan that [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-6] will be presenting is what the timeline to execution is and when do we need you guys to be full
Agent: On and when are we having standups?
Speaker 7: I think that's all to come. So, but I like the way
Agent: That you're thinking that's right on track. All right. Well, you can have the baton back.
Agent: Okay, no, I'm just going to wrap it up and say if you're if it's cold or you're staying warm, have a good long weekend with a lot more information.
Speaker 6: And I will be back [DATE-25] in your inbox
Agent: So just highly
Agent: Appreciate it. Great. Well, it's
Agent: Been a
Speaker 6: Conversation. Thank you so much.
Speaker 7: Yeah, thank you. All right. Bye bye.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1.

The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the specific pain points of the customer's current case management system. While the customer did mention that finding an efficient and effective system was a priority, the sales rep did not delve deeper into the issues faced by the customer with their current system.

2. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's budget and timeline for implementing a new system. This information would be crucial in understanding the customer's needs and proposing a solution that fits their requirements.

3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with software sales and their expectations from the sales process. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their approach to better meet the customer's needs.

4. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with the sales rep's previous company, [ORG-5]. This would have provided insight into the customer's preferences and potential concerns.

5. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's team structure and workflow in more detail. This would have helped the sales rep understand how the customer's team operates and how the new system could be integrated into their workflow.

6. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's data migration needs. Understanding the customer's data migration requirements would have helped the sales rep propose a solution that meets their needs and ensures a smooth transition.

7. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with automation and integration. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's technical capabilities and propose a solution that fits their needs.

They also mentioned that the ability to generate forms or letters with just a few clicks would be a significant time-saver for them. Additionally, they emphasized the importance of having a dashboard or landing page that allows them to do triage and prioritize their activities, instead of having to rely on memory or reviewing a calendar within Outlook. They also mentioned that visibility into the process of the entire team would facilitate conversations about what's working and what needs to be adjusted.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did seem to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They mentioned that they were looking for a way to make their job easier and eliminate the burden of over-administering and over-managing their work. The seller mentioned that they have worked with case managers who have similar pain points and that they believe they can make huge improvements with their product. The customer also expressed interest in the product's ability to generate a packet for them with the individual's name and social security number pre-filled, which the seller confirmed was possible. Additionally, the customer mentioned that they were looking for a system that streamlines what they do and supports veterans throughout the application process, which the seller's product appears to do.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They expressed gratitude for the opportunity to work with the seller and were looking forward to implementing the seller's product to make their job easier. They also appreciated the potential time-saving benefits of the product and the possibility of automating certain tasks. However, they also had concerns about data migration and the timeline for implementation. Overall, they seemed interested in moving forward with the deal, but wanted to ensure that their needs and concerns were addressed.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: It seems like the right decision makers were on the call, as the customer, Speaker 6, who is the supervisor for the organization's school program, and Speaker 7, a team member who also handles case management and supporting veterans throughout the application process, were both actively participating in the conversation. They provided detailed information about their current processes and expressed specific pain points and needs.

The agreed-upon next steps include the sales team starting with giving an overview of their product, what they need to know for implementation, and understanding the customer's process. After that, the sales team will likely have a more in-depth discovery session with the customer to gather further information and tailor their product to the customer's needs. The customer also mentioned a follow-up with their own decision maker, Speaker 8, to discuss next steps.

Therefore, the answer to this question is unclear, as no specific next steps involving additional decision makers were discussed during the call.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1.

video_19775_167_6qr3y000000g38nAAA,"Agent: Sales course platform so anything sales or service related. Obviously the forecasting conversation that we're going to have [DATE-1] falls into our sales book.
Agent: So to meet those of you that I haven't met before and looking forward to this session [DATE-1].
Speaker 5: Really nice
Agent: I'll let [PERSON-1] do an intro before we maybe very quickly hand over to your team and then I can kind of set more of a scene.
Agent: Thanks [PERSON-2], thanks [PERSON-3], hi everybody, I'm [PERSON-1], I'm a solution engineer at [ORG-1], so I've worked with [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] together a bit more from a technical perspective, so I will be giving the demo [DATE-1] and really curious to hear from you what we want to do with Forecaster.
Agent: There's a lot of you, so maybe we won't do an intro for everybody, does somebody want to maybe introduce the group or maybe [PERSON-4], or [PERSON-5]?
Speaker 5: Yeah, yeah, I'm welcome to do that.
Speaker 5: Yeah, so I think our background is was that I've been working with the [NORP-1] medium business, trying to sort of relaunch the [ORG-1] for Captain Model, and I realized the art of the box reporting.
Speaker 5: And so I started to do some research in art to sort of leverage the reports and the model. And then I saw that there are a few salesforce latest items that we could probably use.
Speaker 5: So which is why we sort of request this demo to sort of understand. the full functionality and the potential of these tools.
Speaker 5: And in terms of the audience, we have people from customer ops, sales ops, brands, or IT, so for the managing of our [PERSON-6]. So basically, other people are as well linked to ops forecasting, and stuff like that.
Speaker 5: That's basically it.
Agent: Brilliant. Perfect. And so yeah, I suppose we can cover that off.
Agent: I think one thing that's important for us to cover from the get go is an overview of the functionality that you already have access to and sales force [DATE-1] to make sure you're aware of what forecasting capability exists in the platform.
Agent: And then on top of that we will perfect [PERSON-7], nobody. And on top of that, then we're going to give you an overview of revenue intelligence, which is our kind of gold standard forecasting too.
Agent: So we'll do a little bit of both [DATE-1] starting with what you want. already have access to.
Agent: Before we get into that, and [PERSON-8], I don't know if it's [ORG-2] e back over to you, but it would be good to understand ideally what you would like to achieve fro m a forecasting tool where you're looking to get to and maybe things that you're not utilizin g there that you might want to utilize in the future .
Speaker 5: Back over to you for that. Yeah, thanks. I would say in terms of goals first is [DATE-2] forecasting, a tool that's user-friendly as well and that's got advanced analytics with [PRODUCT-1] embedded in it.
Speaker 5: So, [PERSON-9]'s can see the coverage and a lot of other stuffs are country-based analytics and basic functionality and updated features of uploading forecasting and also link the different objects and self-force i.e.
Speaker 5: Opportunities and then for cats thing, for example I mean, able to look at both your [ORG-3] e and what your forecast is and the different level s of adjustment, like I said, it can coverage .
Speaker 5: And then the story of the portal as well.
Speaker 6: So basically, it's a historical forecast and plus report needs another key thing. And I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Yes.
Speaker 6: I think also we need to be able to use the forecasting in line with the stage organization and also the way that we are selling our project.
Speaker 6: So to be able two forecast by project in the same times in terms of revenue type, recurring revenue, non-recurring revenue, to be able to manage the direct forecasting and indirect forecasting through our business partner.
Speaker 6: So all these kind of dimensions, in the same way So yes, that may need the big challenge we have.
Speaker 5: In the same times.
Speaker 6: Because till now, I think, but it's a long time that I didn't put my hand into the forecast. we are we have some issue to be able to launch for instance different forecasting type in the same times.
Speaker 6: In the past we have to choose by using a forecasting type by project or not
Speaker 5: By revenue about in the same time so yes. That's kind of a challenge. And I just wanted to add as well that also another important also the ability two forecast by product family.
Speaker 5: Your software services is another key thing. And then also I had a question maybe I'll just put out there is also the ability to I think currently.
Speaker 5: You will limited to four forecasting type more than four forecasting types as well.
Agent: And I wanted to know if it's possible to sort of have
Speaker 5: What are those types [DATE-1], [PERSON-8]?
Speaker 5: No, we have a TV, a space, not repairing, and trying to put a family as well. So you can arrive before.
Agent: At some point we will
Speaker 5: We think that it's going to be sort of, need more than four. That's what I think. Okay. And the other thing is we will customize our own focus in types.
Agent: Maybe putting in different information and different revenue times that we are across the business as well. So, okay. Perfect.
Agent: And then not to put [PERSON-10] or anybody on your team on the spot, but is there anything that you want
EndUser: To add from kind of more of a solution inside of things that we should be aware of or that needs to be considered?
EndUser: I guess there's an assumption of our opportunity it will be within [ORG-1], so where it's not that might be a. the left field challenge for you is to think through and say how a forecasting kit these might work and to match point around [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: I think if we are really clear on the bread and butter part of forecasting so we know kind of what the most requirements are, the most processes. or if you didn't hear that, that's going to help.
EndUser: And hopefully what we've already got enabled in our all can used for that.
Speaker 5: Be enhanced or
EndUser: The [PRODUCT-1] piece, I'm curious, but I'm also a little bit nervous about AI full stop.
Speaker 7: So I think if we can give you some of our thoughts around AI, but also you can share as well the art possibilities that might be good place to start. If I can just jump in as well.
Speaker 7: So I'm [PERSON-13] to Enterprise architecture and search. Obviously forecasting is just one aspect of this.
Speaker 7: If you look at it holistically, you know, the data that we cover through the forecasting versus the actual and have that feedback to make, you know, our future, you know, forecasts more and more intelligent.
Speaker 7: So it's joining up revenue ops with, you know, intelligence so that, you know, we can use the rich history of data to make sure that, you know, we can do things like you.
Speaker 7: You know, giving dynamic guidance, you know, doing the right matching, doing the right prioritization and having that as a continuous improvement loop, you know, with all of the rich analytics kind of, you know, that, you know, underpin that.
Agent: That's really what we need more strategically if that makes sense . Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: And I suppose that kind of predictive historical elements and I don't know that you already have in your [ORG-4] and leveraging that and bringing that to the next level to kind of get a more accurate foretaste and being able to then predict more accurately into the future.
Speaker 5: All of those kind of predictions
Agent: So that's spot on.
Speaker 5: Does anybody know, do you have [PERSON-13] turned on
EndUser: Already
Agent: In [ORG-1]?
Agent: [PERSON-13] for Sales?
Agent: No. You don't. OK. And again, we can work with you on all of these things. It's just good to capture this.
Agent: Ok, is there anything that anybody else wants to add before we move on in terms of requirements, in terms of ideally when you'd look to get to a point where you'd have something in place that you're kind of happy with?
Agent: Is there any kind of timelines in place right now or anything that you're working towards that we should be aware of?
Speaker 5: I do have an enhancement through comments, basically linking sort of maybe embed in the pipeline inspection to with forecasts or vice versa.
Speaker 5: Because right now in funds we're using the two two and the diversity separately and I was just thinking as we're using rather than users going in.
Speaker 5: And now that the model to do pipeline inspection, maybe to sort of combine them together, because one's looking at pipeline and
Agent: When you look at the pipeline inspection, there is the element of forecasting it anyway.
Agent: So rather than come out of the model to then look at inspection, I'm just thinking, why not combine both together?
Agent: And that's exactly what we do in [ORG-1] [DATE-1].
Agent: And for anybody that's familiar with that tool, pipeline inspection, what we do with [ORG-5] is we use some of that information and combine it together to be that kind of forecasting tool that we have.
Agent: So that's the goal, that's what we want all of our customers to be able to do. So yeah, understood. I will very quickly just touch on this slide before I hand over to [PERSON-1] to demo.
Agent: But there is a lot of capability in your platform [DATE-1] that you already have access to.
Agent: You've just mentioned pipeline inspection, a fantastic tool that re-aids with the forecast because the two do come hand in hand as a sales leader or a sales rep being able to zoom in on that pipeline and understand if it's been pushed out or understand if it has a propensity to close, understand why it's low, if a rep's been kicking things out, if a rep needs to be coached.
Agent: That's a tool that you do have or... already have access to [DATE-1] So just to kind of make you aware of that and if anybody needs to understand tha t a little bit more detail, we can share resource s with you after this call Another tool that you have is collaborative forecasting and when those tools are combined there's a lot of power in that kind of forecast capabilit y and your pipeline capability coming together There's a lot here, there's a lot more things There's [PERSON-13], like we've just talked about there's a lot that we probably need to work with yo u to make sure that you're getting more out of your sale s and your pipeline capability, and we can take these in turn.
Agent: But for the purpose of this call, we're going to move on to the Revenue Intelligence tool, but we're going to show [PERSON-9] from the get go what you do already have access to [DATE-1].
Agent: So I'm going to let [PERSON-1] take it from here.
Agent: If anybody wants to follow up on any of these pillars in more detail, reach out to [PERSON-2] and I separately and we will be happy to take you through them.
Agent: Now I'll hand over to [PERSON-1] unless there's any questions at this point.
Agent: [PERSON-16],
Agent: Floor is yours. Perfect. I'm going to share my screen.
Agent: We can open up in a second.
Agent: Hope you can all see Yes.
Speaker 6: Salesforce now.
Agent: Yeah. Okay, perfect. Cool. I'm going to start from forecasting itself, something that you already have [DATE-1]. Potentially, it still looks a bit different and that's fine because you mentioned that you currently don't have [PERSON-13] turned on. That's okay.
Agent: I would recommend to turn it on when you feel ready. You can test it in a sandbox first before you actually push it to production.
Agent: In general, the only prerequisite that you have for [PERSON-13] is 540 records per object, but I would say that this is probably safe to solve, that you will definitely have 435 records.
Agent: So what I have here is the collaborative toolpaths. So this is something that you can work with [DATE-1]. In general, you will have it broken down by [DATE-3].
Agent: So this is something that I'm just currently looking at [DATE-4] that I'm in, and then you will have broken down by the individuals that are assigned to your individual team here.
Agent: So I'm currentl y looking at the perspective of [ORG-6] . You did mention earlier what about if it's indirect pipeline.
Agent: So if you would have particular partners and they would actually also help you to generate pipeline, you could have them in this view here as well.
Agent: So the question would just be how do you currently track that?
Agent: Is that already in salesforce or is that currently externally?
Agent: But if it's in salesforce then you could have that as part of the forecasting here as well.
Agent: I have here some quotas in, so these are for the individuals, and then of course there is a team target as well.
Agent: Then here at the top I have these different categories, and I will actually see how am I performing against those different categories that I have.
Agent: The visual indication is kind of like an upgrade to what we were used to in general from the forecasting within [ORG-1].
Agent: And this is where you will then get actually the insights into what category is currently performing well and where is it that potentially you need some improvement.
Agent: Also on an individual level or is that on a whole category for the whole team. And with the overall [PERSON-13] activities, you will then have some insights. Let me have her. There we go.
Agent: Sorry, this is my demo org. So sometimes when you do something live, something goes wrong. Now my hover doesn't want to appear. There we go.
Agent: So here you can see that, for example, it gives you some insights into that this value has been decreased. So it will actually give you some insights to actually structure the forecast a bit better.
Agent: Is there certain areas where the revenue is going down or the predicted opportunity value?
Agent: So for example, the best case that would be.
Agent: But important because these are the opportunitie s from our understanding that are run rat e for the product model And so these will give you the insight s and then down here actually the breakdow n of the individual opportunities So this is right now a full list of everythin g that sits in [ORG-7]'s team for the selected timefram e that I have here, but of course with the filter s that you have here, you could define that a bit further So do you wanna just look at a particular mont h or yet actually wanted to look at the whole yea r, and both of that would be [PERSON-16] And there is a question in the cha t. Let me quickly take a [GPE-1]: [PERSON-17], how would the coverage from your perspective with the friend to the quota?
Speaker 8: Could you talk a bit about that?
Speaker 8: Yeah, hello. To me, the coverage is the ratio between your open pipeline and your target, which is [DATE-5]. So it's a calculation. And [DATE-1], we don't have the ability to add a KPI within the forecast tool.
Speaker 8: So we don't know how to do this. Especially when your forecast could have different types, as we talked earlier before.
Agent: We say, [GPE-2], non-rackering, tool tool, etc. Service software.
Agent: That's perfect. That's a good question. And so for that, we would actually use here the visual indication, and for example, give it the [PERCENT-1]. This is right now looking at the line of [PERSON-14] specifically.
Agent: So [PERSON-14] has this specific quota for Q4 in my example here. And because of what was very close, he is over achieved that. So it will actually give you these insights within the form. will cast here visually .
Speaker 8: Would that be sufficient, [PERSON-17], or what are you thinking of something different?
Speaker 8: No, I think it's okay. See, I'm sorry, I didn't see that. So you have the percentage of the commit forecast will be the total commit forecast on [DATE-6].
Speaker 8: How are the percentages calculated?
Agent: As include closed-plus we know that commits commit and best include closed-plus commit is best and...
Agent: So do you have a detail of the formula?
Agent: In general, you can associate the opportunity stages that you have here with the different forecast categories. I think here in this view, it's a bit easy to see because this is line by line on opportunity level.
Agent: So, for example, qualification counts in my setup as pipeline, where a negotiation will count as a commit. And there can be multiple stages that will fall within the same forecast category.
Agent: This is something that you can define within your sales force and I'm sure you have that set up But take it away to discuss it also with the team if there is something that you wanted to update And I think here it's quite nicely visible So we have two different opportunities one is at [PRODUCT-2] stage and the other one is that proposal However, both of them are from a forecast category under best case and what that will then actually mean And I have here these two opportunities as an example, that will give me the total of 74K and those 93K because they are best case they will then fall under the overall forecast within this category.
Agent: And you will have a targe t that you wanted to achieve for those individual categories.
Agent: And because of that, it will the n give you the insights, are you overachieving or are you underachieving?
Agent: And from a coverag e perspective, this is a good question because you will unlikely <inaudible> s sales team close [PERCENT-2] of the opportunities that you have in the [ORG-3] e. So ideally your pipeline is bigger than the target did you actually wanted to close as close on [NORP-2]Speaker 5: I can see some people can mute.
Speaker 5: Are there more questions or comments?
Speaker 5: I was going to ask if it was possible to sign a report on the coverage. And I'll be used to
Agent: If there's any existing report, the report. So the numbers that you have within a sales phone, you can have an address in there. It's not an issue at all. Then you can definitely create a report based off that.
Agent: And in just a moment, I will also go a bit more into the dashboards to actually see what kind of
Speaker 5: Visuals do you have within the dashboards
Agent: And what can
Speaker 8: You do from there.
Speaker 8: Sorry. Definitely also explain the color coding.
Agent: Sure.
Agent: Do you have like, um, between green and orange and red?
Agent: I would need to check what the color is, to be honest with you.
Agent: Um, in general, um, you can define the range of like, um, what would count as yellow and when is it red from looking at the numbers here, but I would need to verify.
Agent: I would guess that maybe anything under 31 will be red and then when it goes above it will turn into yellow. It looks here and the percentages
Speaker 8: That we have that will then turn green.
Speaker 8: And do you know if this is something we could adjust?
Agent: Let me take that away and then we will follow up.
Speaker 8: And check that for you Thanks.
Agent: I'm going to make a comment for myself.
EndUser: That you mentioned the partner and including that in this view.
Agent: Pipeline.
EndUser: Does the forecasting tool assume a data model that we're following in within our [ORG-1]?
EndUser: So for example, we use the partner objects to link customer opportunities to partners, which I know is a quite a large legacy object from [ORG-1] terms.
EndUser: Is that applicable here or would we need to use something different?
Agent: That is a good question.
Agent: I would take that away as well because I don't have that in the view here right now and I'm not sure if they made any changes on that front. So I'm going to make a note to check that.
Agent: And [PERSON-10], you were saying you're
EndUser: Using the partner object currently. We are. Yeah, the partner. We are planning to move away from that, but whatever you describe what this needs might be, which informs what we
Agent: Move away to or not.
EndUser: Planning
Agent: To move to custom objects.
Agent: And somebody asked earlier about the forecasting types, which might be also a bit relevant always when we talk about, you know, the report on product level, the report on potential indirect pipeline from partners versus direct pipeline generated by the sales team.
Agent: And there is a limit of full forecasting category types. However, you can contact sales for support. But you can increase that limit. This is something that you need. I would recommend to create a case.
Agent: You probably need a bit of justification why you need additional categories. So maybe if you just put something together where you explain what the current categories are and what you need additional ones for, then that should be fine.
Agent: Perfect.
Agent: Are there any more questions right now?
Agent: No, hold on. So all of this... you can currently already do. And so this is probably something that you wanted to take a little look at, try it out in one of the sandboxes.
Agent: And again, I would really recommend to look at [PERSON-13] for sales floor to use the very well of it. And that will help you with some of these nice insights.
Agent: So for example, if I click on this one, and you can see here the opportunity score. And that will give me some insights into why it would actually.
Agent: The whole engine running in the background is powered by [PERSON-13] So I would take a look at that The other things we will jump
Speaker 6: In a little more Just a question, please That means we are able to upload different quota based on the forecast type, for instance .
Speaker 6: If we have, for instance, a forecast type by project, one by revenue type, that mean we will be able to upload quota
Agent: Based on the forecast type. Oh, no. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, so check that out because then you can have the quota. So for example, here, I'm currently opportunity revenue.
Speaker 6: Looking at the Oops.
Agent: This one here. And of course, like you were saying, you can have different types. And I only currently have this one set up here right now. But if you wanted to set it up based off the.
Agent: Product family or you want to set it up based by the product itself and then you can do that as well.
Agent: So it's probably worth taking a little look at that because there was quite a few enhancements forecasting since its original existence.
Speaker 6: In general two
Agent: Okay, it's fine.
Speaker 8: So now I'm gonna, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm not sure. I have a question that may be more for the support team than yourself, I'm not sure.
Speaker 8: So I've got particular access to [ORG-1], I'm viewing [ORG-1] as the VP of Sales in [GPE-3], so I can see all the teams, all the people.
Speaker 8: When I go into the pipeline inspection, first of all, I can't access the chart view.
Speaker 8: It's like the grid is working and the chart is not working if I'm at the VP level as if there is too many information and [PERSON-14] can't display it.
Speaker 8: And I'm not too sure why because to me a graphic view is simpler tha n a list . So I have this problem.
Speaker 8: And also, when I am in the forecast module and I want to select one person in particular, so I'm clicking on open pipeline for that person, for example, I will see the list of opportunity at the bottom of the screen.
Speaker 8: But then if I go into pipeline inspection, it does reset all of it again.
Speaker 8: So I need to, do you select the owner of the team again?
Speaker 8: So by default, my information, which is nothing because I'm not a salesperson. So it's like the pipeline inspection and the list view
Agent: That you have at the bottom is not directly linked. Do you mean on this screen here or do you mean when you went from forecast, you set some filters
Speaker 8: Here and then you jump into the pipeline inspection?
Speaker 8: I usually, I'm not some breakups.
Agent: Sure what you did, sorry, because I do have
Speaker 8: So if you go back to the forecast. Yeah. Okay, let's say for example, you click on the open pipeline of [ORG-8].
Speaker 8: So I have the list here and then if I go to
Agent: Pipeline inspection on the if I click on the bottom pipe.
Agent: Got it. So for me, it also resettited back to the whole team. And that you would like to actually select under forecast and then you go to the pipeline inspection, that does list with the means those filterings.
Speaker 8: Have it so that when you the individual
Agent: Yeah. Got it.
Agent: We can certainly take a look if there is a trick or a setting to set there.
Speaker 8: We're capturing all of these and we'll come back directly to this group, we'll answer on all of these questions that you're asking.
Speaker 8: Okay, and my comment in the beginning was to say, when I am at the VP level, obviously, he's got, I don't know, like, direct reports and underneath potentially 75 people.
Speaker 8: And if I go to that VP level and I want to see the chart view
Agent: Here, the graphic view, I can't see any data. I've got an error message thing. There are too many records and you can't display it. Okay.
Agent: I can check if there are specific limits or something, which would then cause an issue for the graph to display. If that's the case, then I can let you know.
Agent: And in that case, it would then be a matter of, is it possible to apply certain filters to actually make sure that the graph is loading.
Agent: So for example, what I'm currently doing here is I'm looking at a specific team with certain individual and I just sounded there are 22 people in your case that are reporting to that individual .
Agent: In my example here, I believe eight, so that's a bit of a difference. And then of course you can also set the filters here on the timeframe that you're currently looking at.
Agent: But makes perfect sense, is a known limit and what can be done in that case.
Speaker 8: So I will let you know if there Okay, thanks.
Agent: So with that, I'm going to actually move then also to the opportunity inspection. It sounds like if you're all ready. familiar with that which is good.
Agent: And so just to quickly again point out here you have th e Opportunity Scoring which is quite helpful to actually then make a bit more sense of what ar e the things that you would need to focus on if you have such a long list.
Agent: And you will get her e some good insights into why is there potentially a red flag or a red clock next to an opportunity And in this example here the next step has not been updated for a while.
Agent: So you will get some good visual indications here.
Agent: If you have se en this before then you're all familiar with the top here so that's absolute ly perfect and then just to find out here on the side as well as you can get tho se little cards for the individual opportunities where you get some go od insights.
Agent: One of them that I heard from other customers that they love the mo st is the push counter because you can actually see for the individu [PERSON-18] if people would actually push them out a lot.
Agent: What is the reason for actually doing th at?
Agent: Is it because it's not a real opportunity or is somebody actually hiding the opportuni ty?
Agent: Whatever the reason might be, but at least you would get the insights here and you don't have to calculate this manually anymore because a lot of people used to calculate this custom in [GPE-4].
Agent: Okay, with this, I'm going to move
Speaker 8: Now to a new area. If there are any more questions on the previous one. Yeah, sorry, I'm going to be okay. Just going back to the color coding on the forecast, you know, with a percentage.
Speaker 8: Do you know if that also is depending on the time of the period is what I mean by that is if you are on [DATE-7], then if you're closed is inferior to [PERCENT-3] of your target.
Speaker 8: That is not normal. Whether if you are at [DATE-8] and your closed is [PERCENT-4], that should be a red. I don't know if I make sense in my question.
Agent: So just to play it back, what I understood is if you were to be at [DATE-9] and a number is read, then this is actually acceptable because you're just at [DATE-10], whereby if you're in [DATE-13], then that should be a warning sign because you actually vary forehead in [DATE-13] and you would need to exclude the number.
Speaker 8: Yeah, so I guess the other way of putting that comment is a colloquote could be dependent on the percentage but also in the period.
Speaker 8: So like week one, the percentage to red is not the same one as in [DATE-9].
Agent: So in [ORG-1] we would use like the word like velocity to describe that so we can maybe check then if it's looking at velocity in [DATE-13]. And maybe step that's a question that we come back on.
Agent: But your
Speaker 8: Question makes sense. OK, the reason I'm asking is if you are the VP level, what it's great without forecasting modulus and the color coding is that you can very quickly spot where you have a problem.
Speaker 8: But if your red is not supposed to be red, because as I said in [DATE-7], this is not a normal, then it's a little bit of a shame.
Speaker 9: I suspect it's looking at the closed date. and waiting where it is in probability and looking at the closed day. I suspect that's what's making it right.
Speaker 8: Mm-hmm.
Agent: You can check for the specifics on the color coding and what I can see in the instance that you can actually set yourself. They're really amazing resources for all of these people.
Agent: [PERSON-3] and I also know that myself, we were taking notes while you were asking your questions.
Agent: So we will come back and we will share a few resources with you where you can go through and see what are certain adjustments that you want it to do on your end. Perfect. Cool.
Agent: With that, I'm going to go into something new. This is something that you currently don't have in your sales halls. And here you will have additional insights. And also all of that should be action driven.
Agent: So if you actually get any recommendations by the system, then it will also give you insights into what can you actually do as an individual or as a team. This was something that [PERSON-3] mentioned as.
Agent: Revenue Intelligence and so this is something that we're going to start from here Still, all the data that you have in [ORG-1] is really important and really relevant and s o the better people are actually using the system and the higher the adoption is the bette r as usual you will have those reports.
Agent: So here this is something that is probabl y quite familiar and not super new to actually look at the team quota here and then actuall y have a an idea of like who is performing how and how is the overall team doin g. This will now here also give you visual indications as to this is something that you wanted to achieve and this is how much you have already wo n. It will give you some insights into the day s. So to your question [PERSON-17] on like where are we currently within [DATE-13] or within t he quarter and then also the insights into what is it that you need to [GPE-5]: Is there a gap to actually achieve the goa l. order or is it currently actually looking quite okay?
Agent: And based off that, so this is just a h igh level graph to give you the initial insights. It will then also give a breakdown of what are the things that need to be focused on.
Agent: And so are there certain opportunities that need attent ion and why is that?
Agent: So for example, here if there are opportunities that are stuck at a particu lar stage and if I don't actually click on that, you have here the action of framework.
Agent: So there are certain things that we can do from there. Can either just hop onto the record or potentially you want to take certain actions, maybe the individual wants to sen d an em ail.
Agent: Or actually to want to set up a meeting with the customer. I quickly open this particular record as well and take a look on the individual page.
Agent: You will see that there are additional insights that you will get per record as well.
Agent: So here you will get out of the box some insights into what are the revenue trends and forecast for this particular customer, how is the pipeline performing in general, but it will also look at other areas within the business and so for example, the support places and is there something from a service perspective that is currently open?
Agent: Because if SSL is individual, you wanted to actually close a deal and it might be a bit of a rush, it might be [DATE-16] and a customer's actually not happy because there are some open support cases, then you would be aware of that And you can take a look at what is the underlying reason .
Speaker 6: Are there any questions?
Speaker 6: Yes.
Speaker 6: The dashboard that you introduced, could we make some custom customization or not?
Speaker 6: For instance, regarding the opportunities needing my attention, that could be also the, the level of revenue of opportunities that need to, for instance, if I have an opportunity on [MONEY-1], I will need to pay attention on that kind of opportunity.
Speaker 6: So is it possible to
Agent: Adjust the criteria on the dashboards?
Speaker 6: It is.
Agent: So this is just what you get out of the box. And you simply could turn it on. And as long as you have salesforce data in your salesforce all, then you're all good. And you will get those insights.
Agent: If there is something that you wanted to adjust, then you can do that. So you could add here another column that will then actually look at the revenue of that particular opportunity.
Agent: And just to give you an example, here my sales copy. it . This is something that our solution engineering tools built. So this is something that is custom. You could build that as well.
Agent: What you can see here as an example, if I click on. to commit, then this would be a similar example to what you're talking about. Not a million, but you get the idea.
Agent: So for example, here these are the two two opportunities that are currently in commit. And you can see with the support of [PERSON-13], the likelihood of actually closing this opportunity is quite different.
Agent: In one instance, it's [PERCENT-5], so it's not too bad. But here [PERCENT-6] is actually quite low. And this could give some visual indications then. individual but you could also have that for the team .
Agent: Didn't actually say, hey, here on the second one, we need to be a bit careful because it' s quite a high value opportunity for our team . the percentage of closing it is quite low .
Agent: What is it that we can do ?
Agent: That's again where you can then use the action framework . can jump into the record .
Agent: In combination with [PERSON-13], so this is something that we could use [DATE-1], we wil l then have here, for example, in aspects next best action .
Agent: Will then give do to increa se the likelihood of closing this Okay, thanks.
Speaker 6: Me the insights into this is what you can specifically [ORG-9] y.
EndUser: Any more questions or Bit of a dry question.
Agent: Thoughts right now?
EndUser: So does the team is the team set of based on role hierarchy?
EndUser: Yes. So if role hierarchy is maintained and say I move from one manager to another, I'll just forecasting kind of handled
Agent: That as a take all the revenue with me and the money managers, it's snapshot in time to keep it segregated.
Agent: How's the support that type of requirement?
Agent: Do you need to retain historic
EndUser: Data with an old team and then once the person is moving, it needs to be aligned to a new team or what are the insights there?
EndUser: Possibly. I guess whatever out the box is probably what we would start as a point on our report needs. It might be a sage thing, probably a pre-organisation thing. We had a challenge with [ORG-1] way.
EndUser: If you move the role hierarchy, all of a sudden, all that revenue for that individual went to a new report line and therefore it didn't
Agent: Understand for [DATE-16], it actually should be a portion to the previous manager's report line.
Agent: So is that all kind of achievable or concentrated on that?
Agent: I mean, this is something that we do a lot and I bet that [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] can talk to that.
Agent: When we have like customers that we live after and then potentially there will be some movement within our own teams and so on.
Agent: So there will be really good resources that we will share as part of the resources after our call and I will include that as well.
Agent: Just as when I moved onto this team in [DATE-17], my previous information didn't follow me. I moved into this and started from [ORG-10].
EndUser: So, we'll take it away and we'll see what we can find.
Agent: We move a lot in [ORG-1], so we've definitely had to figure something out there. So, yeah, we'll come back on that one, [PERSON-16]. It's fine for you.
Agent: Cool, excellent. Also just checking the time, but I think we are still good. So a few more things that I wanted to point out here.
Agent: We've talked about these other new things, and then here are actually the individual actions that you would need to do to take as an individual. There are quite a few things that you can actually do here.
Agent: And with anything sales force, you will get a lot at the beginning. You don't have to use all these different things. So you can decide which.
Agent: Of these individual dashboards would actually be helpful So here's just a bit more of a breakdow n for the individual teams Then you also have seen sales performance So sometimes simply a little bit different way s of how you would actually display certain things And again, here [PERSON-13] comes into action s and will give you some insights
Speaker 10: Into, for example, here we can see that a particular industry is very strong . I can see that [PERSON-7], you have your hand up, please go for it. Thanks, [PERSON-1].
Speaker 10: I can see on this, obviously on the dashboard here,
Agent: We're looking at [PERSON-22], right?
Agent: If [PERSON-22] was a palm, right, a partner account manager, would we be able to drill down on particular partners to be able to see their pipeline and forecast?
Agent: Would that be a possibility on there?
Speaker 10: In general, yes.
Agent: It would just be a question of how they are currently set up in your sales force. For example, when [PERSON-10] was talking about the roles,
Speaker 10: Do they currently have roles within your sales force?
Speaker 10: Or how do they currently handle the data?
Speaker 10: How does that currently work for you?
Speaker 10: Well, currently we attach a wealth. We pack them up the opportunity level under the opportunity which relates to them.
Speaker 6: Thank you.
Speaker 6: I suppose would that give us the, would that be able to then be built into the dashboard if they're attached to each individual opportunity?
Agent: Yes, and partner
Speaker 10: Are only accounts.
Speaker 10: So they attach to the account or to the opportunity?
Speaker 10: We attach them to the opportunity for pipeline. From the pipeline point of view, we would attach them to the opportunity. We do have them on the account, but it's at a very... if I use the word loose level,
Agent: That partner is associated with that account. Now we might be looking at the technology further down the line, you know, or rebuilding that foot. At the moment, the opportunity level.
Speaker 10: We attach them to
Agent: [PERSON-22], we're not allowed to move through to our next stage, which would be best case, unless a partner to it or say that there's no partner attached to that opportunity.
Speaker 10: An opportunity from pipeline
Speaker 10: We attach
Speaker 10: I don't know if this is similar. So we attached it at the opportunity level and that you can report on a then, or show it in a dashboard based on the opportunity.
Speaker 10: And then here what I would be is if let's see I was and then I could select the partners
Agent: One that I would have one two there, which I look after and see the view. Best upon that partner.
Agent: In general, that is all possible.
Agent: And then it's just a matter of like, how do you have that currently in [ORG-1]?
Agent: And you mentioned earlier that you're currently using the standard partner object. But you're thinking of moving to the custom aqua, which is perfectly fine.
Agent: So we can also share resources in general on best practices around the part of the pipeline and in pipeline management.
Agent: I guess in general, one idea could be if you have them, for example, as accounts and sales force and then here I have lead source but if that would be for example accounts that you could search for particular partners and based off that it will then new dashboard.
Speaker 10: Recalculate to actually currently have a
Agent: Excellent, thank you. Perfect. Very good question and I think there were some other people that came up with me, other more questions right now.
Agent: Not at the minute. That's perfectly fine. You know what to do when you have a question. So just jump in when you are ready. The historical trend is a little bit boring.
Agent: In my example here, just because this is a demo arc and I don't have a lot of data here, but the idea is that you will then also be able to actually look at historical trends.
Agent: And for example, you have to do quarters and did that actually then change from [DATE-14] to the next.
Agent: This was something that in general was always a bit difficult With the standard reports and dashboards that we have in [ORG-1] because it's very good and same This is true [DATE-1], but it was always a bit of a challenge to actually see [DATE-14] on [DATE-18] or [DATE-16] And this is something that will be covered here .
Agent: What I wanted to also take a look at is the white space analysis. At the moment, I only have a [GPE-6] map, but this can be any map within the world.
Agent: And what this does is it will actually give you some insight into where do you have open opportunities within your customer base. So, for example, here, I would have the different products that this company is selling.
Agent: And then at the top, you would have the different accounts.
Agent: And it will actually then give you a breakdow n as to these are the things that we have already sol d to the customer It's actually here in purple and then in white it would be a potential And so from here you could give some insight s for the individual salesperson if they're a bit stuc k and maybe they look to think abou t what kind of pipeline generating campaigns could they ru n or should they send out particular informatio n about something that you offer for your customers and you could then have a targeted email s, you could have targeted meetings where it's specifically about certain products becau se there is a higher potential of actually selling that into your customer [PERSON-28]: In general we've talked.
Agent: A lot or I talked a lot and there were a lot of really good questions and so I just wanted to pause here for a moment and actually see is there something that you haven't seen?
Agent: We spoke about the forecasting first, what you already have right now.
Agent: We then spoke a little bit about the opportunities headline inspection and you had some questions there as well that we will follow up on and then about the new insights that we have here on how we can and then actually analyze that on a deeper level how you can take actions from here how you could also have custom views and then also the white space analysis Is there something that you can think of right no w if we think of slow-lasting management, KPIs
Speaker 5: Anything that you haven't seen ?
Speaker 5: Yeah, for example, adjustments. I haven't seen any analytics on adjustments.
Speaker 5: I know in the forecast module, if you're able to see adjustments, but a view where, you know, as a manager, you go in or depending on where you're sitting in the hierarchy, and you can easily see the adjustments that have been made and the difference.
Speaker 5: And then, I think we also wanted a view where you can see the different changes to your pipeline. So for example, where people are in and out of the pipeline.
Agent: Moving deals
Speaker 5: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 5: Do you have a view of that?
Speaker 5: You know, you can basically see what's
Agent: Coming out of the pipeline and then as well as a jossmith. Very good point. And I would recommend to actually do that under the forecasting itself. So in regards to moving opportunities out.
Agent: So you would be able to see that from within here.
Agent: So how did I do this?
Agent: I went to the forecast. You will look at your individual opportunities and you have this little card icon here. And within there, you will be able to see if people are pushing out the opportunities.
Agent: Or you will also actually get some insights into if people have moved stages backwards.
Agent: And so he will get those insights. We might just get [PERSON-8] to repeat his question,
Speaker 5: Just saw the comments in the chat.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-8], would you mind maybe just so that everybody else clear?
Speaker 5: Yeah, I mean, [PERSON-24], it's that, as you get in date, that report that you're doing [PRODUCT-3], it's a lot of manual work where she wants to see the deals that are being moved in and out of the pipeline and the different stages.
Speaker 5: I mean, [PERSON-24], can you hear me?
Speaker 5: Can you
Speaker 8: Just sort of?
Speaker 8: Doctor, that use case because I know there's a lot of work for you that you do on the cell. I'm sorry, it's poking up all the time. I didn't get the question entirely, but
Speaker 8: Yeah, I think it's okay. The fact that we can visualize the way we can right now in the pipeline inspection, if again, assuming it works perfectly fine at every management level. I think
Speaker 5: It should be a
Agent: I'll take it offline with you, [PERSON-8], if that's OK. You'll show. OK. And just to add to this, when we're in any forecasting calls with our managers and sales more straightaway, they look for those visual cues.
Agent: So on that first line, you can see that stage went backwards so straightaway, then my manager would drill into that and say, why have you now moved this backwards or why have you pushed this side?
Speaker 5: So we do have visual cues, [PERSON-8], that kind of thing we can drill down into. Thank you.
Speaker 5: And then, I thought I was reading somewhere, is it possible to pull in the custom field into the view?
Speaker 5: The columns where you have [DATE-5] closed early, as a new functionality?
Agent: I
Speaker 5: Think I read it somewhere, just want to confirm.
Agent: If you build it, not in the top.
Speaker 5: In this view here?
Speaker 5: No, not in the leaves here, not in the leaves here, or the top.
Agent: Here in the top?
Agent: Yeah, is it possible to pull in the custom field?
Agent: Let me confirm if this is correct because I know that people were asking that for a very long time.
Agent: We've captured that mat so we can come back to you directly
Speaker 5: On that as well.
EndUser: Sure. Quick one from me. Conscience would look at an opportunity view of forecasting.
EndUser: What do we get to see of an actual individual?
EndUser: So where there could be a sandbag or not?
Agent: I had to get it in there,
Agent: You know I did, but... It's such a technical term, [PERSON-22]. He would
EndUser: Have been saying so. I heard it for the first time [DATE-22] and I've been intrigued by what it means.
EndUser: So what is a sandbagger?
EndUser: That's the first question. How can you
Agent: Spot it?
Agent: Let me see your best.
Agent: I remember that because [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-2] were talking differently about that [DATE-22] and I was like, what is the sandbagger?
Agent: If I remember it correctly, somebody is performing well. So let's say, for example, here [PERSON-14] has [PERCENT-1]. So [PERSON-14] is fine.
Agent: And what could [PERSON-14] do?
Agent: [PERSON-14] has some opportunities within [DATE-28] and they're actually looking very good.
Agent: But because he is already at [PERCENT-7] you could push them into [DATE-24] So he has an easy start And I can see a lot of nodding from [PERSON-3] So I guess that I passed this test The definition is correct What you can do in these instances from a system perspective because I think it's always a bit of like what can we do with the syste m and what can we do with people and processes One example is, for example, those visual cues So have opportunities stage has been moved.
Agent: This one is red.
Agent: Why?
Agent: Because it actually went back.
Agent: It was before that it was a proposal stage and that is actually further ahead to close to one than [ORG-13] d. So there are the visual keys that you would get as a manager but also as an individual when you do that it will be visible.
Agent: And then as well as the push counter here at the top. So you will ha ve those calculated automatically for you.
Agent: So if you can see that [PERSON-16] people are actually pushing out opportunities on a frequent bas is. Then you will have those insights and you can have a chat about why is this actually [ORG-13]Agent: Is this because the customer is not ready or is this because
Agent: Something is been hidden here somewhere [PERSON-3], is there something that you wanted to add here?
Agent: In different [DATE-14]?
Agent: There's other things that you... Oh sorry, [PERSON-30], do you want to go first?
Agent: Go for [PERSON-3].
Agent: Just there's other things that you can look at like high activity when their last activity was and these things pop up So when I go into my pipeline view of as a rep I can see you know when the last activity was on the counter So if I was a manager looking at my stuff, I would say okay, well, you've got this opportunity You were talking to the customer [DATE-22], but it's not in [DATE-22] what's going on So there's loads of different things I think we would look at the visual cues first and then you would look at
EndUser: Opportunities that have moved out of [DATE-18] And then our managers anyway would drill into them and that's how we I don't want to oralize these spots on virus and cel l sports .
EndUser: And I guess what you described there, because it's all data in [ORG-1], there's no reason why we couldn't create our own report and dashboards, more pivoting on an individual versus an opportunity.
EndUser: So therefore, I can almost say for [ORG-8], kind of quite with the name at the top, she has this number of activities, this number of push-ups, push counts, et cetera, et cetera.
EndUser: And therefore, it's almost a scorecard of my team versus a scorecard of their opportunities. So I think to [PERSON-26]'s point earlier, using maybe
Speaker 10: An engine or a model, which goes and out in SPOS or label certain individuals as being more of a sandbag than others or [ORG-9] or sandsterable?
Speaker 10: Yeah, the only thing I would add is the sandbag can happen the other way as well or let's be honest with you, right?
Speaker 10: In the sense that I'm not going to hit [DATE-16] so I'm going to sit on the opportunities to hit [DATE-30], right?
Speaker 10: So basically it can happen anywhere, you know, I suppose [DATE-26] that process, so if you write [PERSON-10], I suppose from that point of view, could we build stuff which would alert us exceptionally portness and other things?
Speaker 10: You know, that triggered that thing at the 14, you that.
Agent: The top there where you were showing us stuff where we're showing us know, what moved out and things like would be the one of the key things that we'd be able And there that's how I, [PERSON-3], would be reported on.
Speaker 10: I think that to try and pick up on you. is reporting in place, because
Agent: So, for instance, if I've committed deals, and I guess friends, rather than if it's a one-off, it's a change. So if it's certain individuals and it keeps happening, then that's then manage.
Speaker 10: Behavior that you
Agent: So it will highlight it. We can get a report of, okay, so I committed it, and then I'm going to have to take it out of commit.
Agent: Well, that's like, we don't do that here if you're committing it, committing it. and yeah, there'll be exceptions, but they'll be managed accordingly.
Agent: So it gives my leadership team, they've all got visibility of all the deals and then the stages and then it's just, we're managed as well on how we a report of how many days, it's been in best case pipeline and at each stage, you'll be able to get move stages.
Speaker 10: So we'd have
Speaker 10: Those things.
Agent: So that intelligence just to be able to see and then you'll build a pattern.
Agent: And like if an error an op-in for [DATE-22], that then suddenly we said to your point, [PERSON-7], say I'm not on track to hit my target.
Speaker 10: I had
Agent: So I'm going to push that out and have [DATE-35]. My manager would get an email notification to say that I moved that out of [DATE-18].
Speaker 10: So that's a way to then address it straight away. So you can set up things like that as well.
Speaker 9: So that's just another comment to your point. So yeah, brilliant. Thank you. Just a quick question. See these. dashboards and reports are we limited to
Agent: The number that we can have or is it that we can have as many as we've on?
Agent: No with [ORG-16] you can create what you need
Agent: And I'm thinking if there are any known limits.
Agent: Not that I'm aware of because like with the one thing with the standard reports and dashboards is for example the number that you can actually visually display or how many components you can have within one page and so on.
Agent: You will get a lot of standard dashboards out of the box. I just put this one up because this one is a bit focused on activities. Again, you can make a comment.
Agent: To those if those templates would not fit exactly what you would need it And then if you needed some specific KPIs or specific things that we would need to display then those can be created and you can either have them as a separate dashboard like this Or you could put them
Speaker 9: Directly on a record like an opportunity or an account
Agent: Or whatever it needs to go .
Agent: Perfect. Yeah, I just put this one up because of the activities. So there is some things that are already reported out of the box.
Agent: And that I appreciate to all your questions, there might be some specifics that you need to take a look at. So you could filter it by the individual or if they're like.
Agent: Other things that you needed to check in from address those dashboards. As [PERSON-3] and then I also mentioned, you can have all these alerts.
Agent: Should it be either within [ORG-1] here, the classic bell icon, or would you have email alerts?
Agent: Either will be fine.
Agent: From my perspective, there was one last thing that I unless there are any
EndUser: Wanted to show, questions right now. Sorry, one more. I think it's a stupid question. We're bad with me.
EndUser: Can the forecast until only sit on top of data, which was already in [ORG-1]?
EndUser: So, for example, if we had a source of data saying,
Agent: Insetniated, that wouldn't have plugged into the forecast, but it wasn't in [ORG-1], I would have handled that use case. for
EndUser: Forecasting,
Agent: It would consider the data that you have within [ORG-1] for revenue intelligence. So all of these the advanced analytics, you can plug in data from external sources.
EndUser: Insights here like
Agent: And the data does not have to sit in [ORG-1]. One of the classic examples that I always get from customers is you have an ERP.
Agent: And the ERP is not [ORG-1] , you have some really important data there, for example , health bill's been paid or has an order been fulfilled , like that .
Agent: Information could then actually be pushed to [WORK_OF_ART-1] e to visualize that within a dashboard like thi s or to actually visualize that on an opportunity .
Agent: Let's say that I'm actually looking at an individual recor d and I need to know if the bill' s have been paid because otherwise it's a bit of an issue, you could actually just lay th at within here.
Agent: And then you're like, okay, great, we can go ahead. The benefit of that is t he data does not have to then actually physically move into sales force.
Agent: So it would not ha ve an impact on your data storage. So that is something that you would get with [NORP-3] ng
EndUser: Intelligenc e. And if the data wasn't [ORG-1], that
Agent: [PERSON-35] example, or there are any restrictions, how much data we can use, or is there a certain number of objects or certain types of objects in their data, or only you can put in forecasting?
Agent: It is a limit, but it's very high right now.
EndUser: It's within the billions. We can chat about it, what volume you would expect and then fast to see your explanation. Those volumes are fine.
EndUser: It's just more in the past I was thinking around, where we have to see it. a distinct data model in [ORG-1] for the custom objects.
EndUser: Could we say, say we had actuals so one would kind of include in the forecast, not just your forecast, but the actuals in that given period, or given opportunity to reflect to your example cancellations or anything else.
Agent: In that data set,
Agent: That was coming in through a separate [ORG-16] in the [ORG-1] to properly custom objects, could then push that data into forecasting. If you have the data within [ORG-1], then yes.
Agent: And it only needs to be either numbers or currency.
EndUser: It wouldn't work if it's, for example, wording or something. That wouldn't work just yet. But we're going to see the model where everything's on the opportunity to then put the forecast in.
EndUser: Front view of it, we could say okay columns x y z from
Agent: Opportunity a b c from the custom objects and d and a from a different custom object. I can all be joined in after you to give us that holistic end-to-end picture. Yes, that's fine.
Agent: And do you anything always to be aware of if you actually take data from other systems and you would put them into sales pools?
Agent: It will increase your data storage. So this is why it's quite nice if you don't have to take the data physically into sales pools. But you could still visualize them.
Agent: So just to give it a thought, does it have to be in a particular view?
Agent: Or could you?
Agent: Be somewhere else where you could actually leverage and not pushing
EndUser: It into sales force .
EndUser: Does that make sense?
EndUser: In context, the question is, we have a slightly different opportunity management process between what we call global sales force and intact sales force, which one of the earlier questions is probably going to be one of the candidates we test this against.
EndUser: And that intact colleagues use the opportunity to reflect cancellations. So, not just up to close one, then have a subsequent stage just to show actually [DATE-31], the customers backed out there following any cancel this.
EndUser: They can use opportunity at a full stop for not just booked, but also forecast, but also booked and cancelled. And I would get the model in global salesforce. We don't.
EndUser: We just go to opportunity close one or lost, and therefore lose sight of those subsequent processes where that's where those are the data sets within salesforce will then complement the opportunity.
EndUser: So as I'm going to handle both and it sounds like it can, that's a good place to be. Thank you.
Agent: I'll show them now. Not only these are perfectly relevant, and I think in some instances at some point, it's a decision.
Agent: How do you want to architect things?
Agent: And what are the benefits and what are the disadvantages?
Agent: So just to be aware of when the data comes in, then your storage overall will go up. Maybe there's another way. So yeah, just to take that away and give it some thought. Cool.
Agent: The last thing that I wanted to show [DATE-1] is about the [PERSON-13] account management, where you will actually get here the account health.
Agent: So here you have a nice big view with a lot of different things of why would an account either be scored red or it would be scored green.
Agent: So you will get some insights into what could be done to improve those relationships. And from there if I dive into an account.
Agent: And I think we have a specific account in our demo org, which is always a bit more excitin g than some of the others.
Agent: And I think if I go directly to the account, it will be a little bi t faster. There we go. [ORG-17] is our favorite account here.
Agent: And this is where you then again hav e like the additional insights on the individual record for an account.
Agent: And so what I had [PERSON-31] y to do for any of these hooks if you can find you pleads will seen where you can see, for example, what are the support cases and so o n. Here you have some high level figures as well that could help with the relationship to this particular custome r. On the example with the service cases, it could be displayed here as well.
Agent: It actually is here on other cases. It just depends on how you want to visualize things. This one you would simply get. So you would just be able to display that if you like this view.
Agent: Again, if it needs to be adjusted to your point, [PERSON-34], not an issue at all. It could be created as a new component, and then you would add that to the page here.
Agent: Again, you will have those insights from [PERSON-13] to then actually see other particular actions that you would need t o take to improve the relationship .
Agent: Anything that we haven't talked about, anything that is missing or any questions from anybody.
Agent: I'll just make a quick comment on this page. In [ORG-1], we would have pretty intense pipeline goals, so as well as revenue goals, we also have to create a certain amount of pipeline.
Agent: So it's a nice little visual cue that say, for example, on this account page, you can see that. pipeline is down [PERCENT-8] [DATE-34].
Agent: So, you know, as a sales leader, you could go on and you could kind of nod your reps then to be creating pipeline on various different accounts.
Agent: And as a sales rep, then, you know, that's something that keeps you honest as well. So just visual kind of cues that then
Speaker 5: You can act upon.
Speaker 5: And is this part of [ORG-5] or [PERSON-13]?
Speaker 5: [PERSON-35] sucks.
Agent: Insights here would come up with revenue intelligence, so to display, to display those here. Of course, if you have already reports and so on, you can display them yourself on your pages.
Agent: But all of these calculations also across different objects, that would be part of revenue intelligence.
Speaker 5: And that will be shown as well on the opportunity record layout. I will also confirm that the intelligence. Yes.
Agent: Any other questions?
Agent: I think we might all be good.
Agent: So I think that's probably a good place to, I suppose what I'll do is, oh, we'll share the Recording with you and [PERSON-10] it would probably be quite useful for you to look at it because we had to see a bit of [PERSON-13] in action on how it picks out things in the conversation that was being taken place [DATE-1].
Agent: But that for everybody as well. I guess from a next steps perspective, once you've had a chance to review and if there's any questions that come up, please let us know.
Agent: We are going to be up actually in the [ORG-14] offices [DATE-35] and [DATE-41], so that's for you all just to be aware of, but also obviously you've got all of our details so you can contact us.
Speaker 5: I don't know [PERSON-8] or [PERSON-10] maybe what your next steps
EndUser: Will be, is it just to continue with the review or what's next?
EndUser: Yes, sorry. Just from my perspective, this all helps feed in the way our heads are going around overall forecasting requirements and solutions to cross-stage.
EndUser: So as we're all aware, the dependencies are we have the data in [ORG-1], which means more other programs. So deliver that. So that's kind of indication of timelines. But this
Speaker 5: Has been really helpful. I'll let [PERSON-8] speak of any opportunities to adopt what you've seen in the existing usage of forecasting across-stage salesforce.
Speaker 5: Yeah, I mean, apart from what you've said also, we're looking at those out of the box Einstein features as well, and trying to see how this consists of we can leverage on this as well.
Speaker 5: And then obviously we picked up some of the functionalities around the out of the box forecasting model. I know it's waiting on me because the come back to us.
Speaker 5: And some of the questions before the one we have, I will use with [PERSON-41] and the [NORP-1]. colleagues, you know, to sort of, yeah, start to
Agent: Use that and see how we can just leverage, like I said, on what we know.
Agent: Perfect. So I suppose as the next step on our side, we'll come back with the questions that were raised. We'll share it with this group.
Agent: And then from that point, if there's any specific kind of items that you want us to follow with you on, that's something that we're very happy to do as well.
Agent: [PERSON-10], one thing we might pick up for the team when we're up in stages around the different kind of support levels as well, because there is various different coaching sessions around how sales scores kind of use [ORG-1] for forecasting and there's expert-led ones and there's also personalized ones depending on the support practice that you're on so we can cover that when we're up and say as well because we do run kind of tailored sessions with you as you're looking to
Speaker 5: Develop and kind of run out of additional functionality so we can talk about that [DATE-30]. Good.
Agent: And we'll be raising some technical support so you can take it as well.
Agent: Super I think we're pretty clear on next step. We'll follow up with you guys
Speaker 5: In the kind of first instance
Speaker 6: And hopefully we get to
Speaker 9: See some of you
EndUser: When we're in [GPE-7] [DATE-30]
Speaker 13: Okay, thank Thank you Thanks everyone.
Agent: You.
Speaker 13: Thank you Bye",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They showed interest in the seller's product and asked several questions to understand its features and capabilities better. They also mentioned that they would like to continue reviewing the product and discuss specific items they want the seller to follow up on. The customer also expressed their intention to leverage the out-of-the-box Einstein features and the functionalities around the seller's forecasting model. Overall, the customer seemed engaged and open to further discussions about the deal.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""I would say in terms of goals first is Q4 forecasting, a tool that's user-friendly as well and that's got advanced analytics with PRODUCT-1 embedded in it.""
2. ""So, [PERSON-9]'s can see the coverage and a lot of other stuffs are country-based analytics and basic functionality and updated features of uploading forecasting and also link the different objects and self-force i.e. Opportunities and then for cats thing, for example I mean, able to look at both your [ORG-3] e and what your forecast is and the different level s of adjustment, like I said, it can coverage .""
3. ""And then the story of the portal as well.""

The sales rep asked these questions during the introduction of the sales call, and the customer showed engagement by providing detailed responses and additional information. These questions helped to establish the customer's goals and needs, allowing the sales rep to tailor the presentation accordingly.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer was concerned about the limit of four forecasting types and wanted to know if it's possible to have more than four. They also wanted to customize their own forecast types and use different information and revenue times.
2. The customer was unsure about the integration of their opportunity data model with the seller's product and asked if it assumes a specific data model. They also mentioned planning to move away from the partner object to custom objects.
3. The customer had issues with the pipeline inspection and forecast modules in Salesforce, such as not being able to access the chart view and having to select the owner again when going from forecast to pipeline inspection.
4. The customer was interested in adjusting the criteria on the dashboards, such as having a gap to achieve the goal or looking at opportunities based on revenue.
5. The customer had questions about how the team is set up in the seller's product, whether it's based on role hierarchy, and how to retain historic data with an old team when a person moves.
6. The customer was curious about the color coding on the forecast and whether it's dependent on the time of the period.
7. The customer asked about the possibility of pulling in custom fields into the view, such as closed early as a new functionality.
8. The customer wanted to see the deals that are being moved in and out of the pipeline and the different stages.
9. The customer was interested in visual cues for sandbagging opportunities and wanted to know how to spot it.
10. The customer asked if the forecast can only sit on top of data that is already in Salesforce or if it can consider data from external sources.

These concerns cover various aspects of the seller's product, including forecasting types, data model integration, usability issues, dashboard customization, team setup, color coding, custom fields, deal movement tracking, sandbagging visualization, and data sources for the forecast.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"1. ""Ideally, what you would like to achieve from a forecasting tool, where you're looking to get to and maybe things that you're not utilizing there that you might want to utilize in the future.""
2. ""Is there anything that you want to add from kind of more of a solution inside of things that we should be aware of or that needs to be considered?""
3. ""If we are really clear on the bread and butter part of forecasting so we know kind of what the most requirements are, the most processes. or if you didn't hear that, that's going to help.""
4. ""And hopefully what we've already got enabled in our all can used for that.""
5. ""If we can give you some of our thoughts around AI, but also you can share as well the art possibilities that might be good place to start.""
6. ""Is there certain areas where the revenue is going down or the predicted opportunity value?""
7. ""And I don't know that you already have in your [ORG-4] and leveraging that and bringing that to the next level to kind of get a more accurate forecast and being able to then predict more accurately into the future.""
8. ""Is there any kind of timelines in place right now or anything that you're working towards that we should be aware of?""
9. ""And again, I would really recommend to look at [PERSON-13] for sales floor to use the very well of it. And that will help you with some of these nice insights.""
10. ""And I would guess that maybe anything under 31 will be red and then when it goes above it will turn into yellow. It looks here and the percentages.""
11. ""And do you wanna just look at a particular month or yet actually wanted to look at the whole year, and both of that would be [PERSON-16].""
12. ""And there is a question in the chat. Let me quickly take a [GPE-1]: [PERSON-17], how would the coverage from your perspective with the friend to the quota?""
13. ""So I would need to check what the color is, to be honest with you.""
14. ""And so this is where you will then get actually the insights into what category is currently performing well and where is it that potentially you need some improvement.""
15. ""And with the overall [PERSON-13] activities, you will then have some insights. Let me have her. There we go.""
16. ""And what kind of visual do you have within the dashboards and what can you do from there.""
17. ""And what can you do from there.""
18. ""And I would need to verify. I would guess that maybe anything under 31 will be red and then when it goes above it will turn into yellow. It looks here and the percentages.""
19. ""And do you know if this is something we could adjust?""
20. ""And check that for you Thanks.""
21. ""And I'm going to make a comment for myself.""
22. ""And somebody asked earlier about the forecasting types, which might be also a bit relevant always when we talk about, you know, the report on product level, the report on potential indirect pipeline from partners versus direct pipeline generated by the sales team.""
23. ""And there is a limit of full forecasting category types. However, you can contact sales for support. But you can increase that limit. This is something that you need. I would recommend to create a case.""
24. ""And you probably need a bit of justification why you need additional categories. So maybe if you just put something together where you explain what the current categories are and what you need additional ones for, then that should be fine.""
25. ""And [PERSON-10], you were saying you're using the partner object currently. We are. Yeah, the partner. We are planning to move away from that, but whatever you describe what this needs might be, which informs what we're planning to move to or not.""
26. ""And I'm going to make a note to check that.""
27. ""And [PERSON-10], you were saying you're using the partner object currently. We are. Yeah, the partner. We are planning to move away from that, but whatever you describe what this needs might be, which informs what we're planning to move to or not.""
28. ""And I'm going to make a note to check that.""","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","It is unclear if the customer felt that the seller's product meets their needs, as the transcript does not provide explicit information about the customer's overall sentiment towards the product. The customer did express interest in understanding the full functionality and potential of the tools, and they mentioned specific features they would like to have, such as the ability to forecast by product family and have more than four forecasting types. However, the customer also mentioned some challenges they have been facing, such as not being able to launch different forecasting types in the same time and having issues with the current forecasting tool. The seller offered to work with the customer on these issues and to provide more information about the product's capabilities. It is possible that the customer's overall sentiment is positive, but more information is needed to make a definitive conclusion.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs when the customer mentioned the challenge they face in launching different forecasting types in the same time. The sales rep quickly moved on to the next topic without delving deeper into this issue.

2. The customer expressed the need to be able to use the forecasting in line with the stage organization and selling process. The sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the specifics of the customer's stage organization and selling process to provide a more tailored solution.

3. The customer mentioned the need to forecast by product family, which is currently not possible with the four forecasting types limit. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's product families and the importance of this feature to their business.

4. The customer expressed a desire to be able to use custom forecasting types. The sales rep could have asked about the specific custom forecasting types the customer needs and why, to better understand the customer's requirements.

5. The customer mentioned the assumption that the opportunity will be within the sales rep's organization. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current situation and any potential challenges or considerations with this assumption.

6. The customer expressed some nervousness about AI. The sales rep could have spent more time addressing this concern, explaining the possibilities and benefits of AI in forecasting, and asking about the customer's specific concerns or reservations.

7. The customer mentioned the need to be able to upload different quotas based on the forecast type. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current quota setting process and how they plan to use this feature.

8. The customer mentioned a challenge with the chart view in the pipeline inspection when at the VP level. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific use case and how they would like this feature to work.

9. The customer mentioned a challenge with the list view in the pipeline inspection when selecting an individual owner. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific use case and how they would like this feature to work.

10. The customer mentioned a desire to customize the color coding in the forecasting tool. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific needs and how they would like the color coding to work.

11. The customer mentioned a desire to include the partner object in the forecasting tool. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current use of the partner object and how they would like to use it in the forecasting tool.

12. The customer mentioned a desire to retain historic data with an old team when a person moves to a new team. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific use case and how they would like this feature to work.

13. The customer mentioned a desire to see the deals that are being moved in and out of the pipeline and the different stages. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific needs and how they would like to use this feature.

14. The customer mentioned a desire to pull in custom fields into the view in the opportunity forecasting. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific needs and how they would like to use this feature.

15. The customer mentioned a desire to include actuals in the forecast, not just the forecast. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific needs and how they would like to use this feature.

16. The customer mentioned a desire to include cancellations in the opportunity management process. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's specific needs and how they would like to use this feature.

video_19776_167_6qr3y000000sbEbAAI,"Agent: With questions, what we can do to help, you know, to make this pretty conversational.
Agent: So we thought we would just start with a couple of slides just to make sure that we're all on the same page, what kind of what we heard. We obviously presented our shared vision.
Agent: So we have like two slides that we pulled from that just to make sure we're all still on the same page.
Agent: And then we're just jumping to what is [LOC-1]?
Agent: That is our recommendation as part of your phase one.
Agent: So I want to talk a little bit high level about what is it, what are the capabilities of it, why are we recommending it?
Agent: And then... and actually pop the hood on it and get into the actual platform itself and show you wha t this looks like and how it would work and help you out better understand it from there So as far as that point we can just talk a little bit about next steps but that is wha t we have from an agenda perspective to that all work for everybody .
Agent: Good. All right. And I know I messaged
Agent: You this, but maybe for [PERSON-1] too, like this is, I think in our view step one and like making things tangible, we told our story of what we envisioned for Chief, and this is really where we think we should start from a [ORG-1] perspective.
Agent: Excellent. Perfect.
Agent: Ok, so I think all of you have probably seen this slide before. But this is just one that we have that we put in our readback.
Agent: But really just again, thinking about how do we go and make this tangible to taste point, right?
Agent: So the idea of the data organization was really where we wanted to start.
Agent: And then really pivot from the data and trying to simplify your data process just to going from manual to more automated, then obviously going into your analytics, being able to surface up really insightful performance metrics to help you all think about your strategy and to build better operational.
Agent: Efficiencies across your organization . then of course also connecting all those channel s and making sure that your customer experienc e was very relevant, very Personalize d across the different stages of your lifecycle .
Agent: Talked a lot about [EVENT-1], right ?
Agent: So like, how do we keep your customers engaged ?
Agent: Do we keep them healthy ?
Agent: Do we keep them in a place where they rene w and they stay with you as an organization ?
Agent: We talked about all those things [DATE-1] . gonna really focus on the data componen t and how that actually would impac t some of these other areas as well down the road .
Agent: Hopefully that's not news or that's not new information here, but I think, take [PERSON-2]'s
Agent: I'll get her e. point that left box that we see, organization and automation really influences the other two.
Agent: You have to have your data together, you have to have that understanding of which to keep customer is to be able to provide quality analytics and quality customer journey.
Agent: So understanding product usage, understanding keep academy data all that in one place, and then using that to automate trigger or whatever, that's really where we're focusing.
Agent: All right, and then again, you've seen all this. I'll just read it real fast. But let us know if this is, hopefully, this also drives with what the shared vision is.
Agent: But obviously, we want to really help enable Keep to operationalize customer data, to work smarter.
Agent: Operationalizing your data will help or allow Keep to break down data and process silo, streamline, customer consumer experiences, and enable agile and automated communications across your Enterprise from internal employees to your Keep-serve high professionals.
Agent: So hopefully that still drives us out. Also, work thumbs up on that.
Agent: Does that make sense?
Agent: Okay . Fantastic. Thanks, [PERSON-1].
Agent: Okay. As
Agent: Far as kind of how we see [ORG-2], like we're really moving on, like pivoting from that vision to like moving forward and how do we actually go and attack that vision, right?
Agent: Like, so a couple of items here we've talked about [PERSON-3], you and I, but I think we've talked that we beat this horse until it's dead or actually it was done.
Agent: We keep beating it, but like the idea of stabilizing Revenue and really helping Support like this idea of making sure that we stabilize Revenue and then we pivot towards growth right so reducing turn and making sure customers are being retained.
Agent: It's really was a key priority.
Agent: To really kick off this entire process So that was, I think, prior number one And then the second one was really like also how do we also keep your customers engaged And how do we identify opportunitie s to drive across and upsell opportunitie s to maximize customer lifetime value of your customers So those are the two areas of stabilizing Revenue and then driving more Revenue in the future .
Agent: And then we also talked a lot about operational efficiency.
Agent: So helping your teams, your go-to-market team specifically, but how do we make them more impactful?
Agent: How do we help automate?
Agent: How do we help, again, surface these insights and helping [PERSON-4] and her team think about what was the performance look like?
Agent: How do we pivot from underperforming metrics?
Agent: And how do we build strategy based off that?
Agent: And then create, of course, that would then create tighter alignment between those go-to-market teams. And of course, at the end, we want to impact the customer experience.
Agent: That's going to be really important to making sure that customers stay on the key platform .
Agent: But really thinking about how do we leverage all this data inside the key platform and how do we connect it to the [ORG-1] experience?
Agent: To trigger automations to trigger meaningful next steps to trigger personalized Customer interactions regardless of your sales service or Marketing And then being able to again like as I mentioned it really surface those insights back to those teams so that they can They can pivot and they can they can make their services.
Agent: They're offering their engagements with customers more meaningful So that's kind of like how we see [ORG-2].
Agent: I don't know I'll just kind of turn it back to you all Like does that make sense Like do you want to add anything to that or [ORG-3] e pivot from anything that I just said there ?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I think from my perspective that covers it really well.
Agent: All right, making it so easy on me.
Agent: [PERSON-5], do you want to add anything to that or you get there?
Agent: Yeah, Okay.
EndUser: I agree with.
Agent: Cool. [PERSON-1], all the way around. We're good here.
EndUser: Yeah, let's yeah.
Agent: Okay. I think it's, I think we can pivot here to data cloud. So we're going to, [PERSON-6] will pick it up here.
Agent: We're going to talk with about what day cloud is now that we kind of set the stage and we'll, again, just keep this conversational and if you have questions, just jump in. So looking forward to it. Yep.
Agent: So like [PERSON-7] mentioned, our hypothesis on a lot of this, especially as it comes to solving for attention, is that your customers are engaging with you in a lot of places.
Agent: They're engaging in [ORG-4], engaging in the website, engaging with Marketing content, and then engaging in the product. And so I really understand where our customers at, and know what to give them next.
Agent: We need to have all that data together into one place. And traditionally, when we're talking about this, we're talking about using all that unified data to then drive it next best action.
Agent: Whether that's an email, a notification to a [ORG-5] to pick up the phone, et cetera.
Agent: And so as you think about this from a really broad concept, a lot of this requires data from the warehouse being unified with data and [ORG-1].
Agent: And just in context for you, [ORG-1] underwent a little bit of a transformation in [DATE-2] in the way that we think about really big data.
Agent: So we had a lot more customers who were storing things in the warehouse, wanted to bring them into. [ORG-1], automate off of them , do it without a whole lot of [ORG-6] .
Agent: So we released what we initially calle d our customer data platform, which has since [ORG-7] rebranded to [ORG-8] . This product was released in [DATE-2]. Been around for [DATE-3].
Agent: We have over 792 customers currently live on it, but it's really designed to bridge that gap between warehouse-level data and what we're doing in [ORG-1]. We're all of our good market teams are interacting.
Agent: I'm going to skip right through this and go to the slide that I think is probably most important for us to take a look at, touch on, discuss. I think the discussion here is probably most important.
Agent: So Data Cloud at the very highest level is designed and we'll look at it from left to right here on the screen. It's designed to ingest data from all of your first party sources.
Agent: That includes [ORG-1], [ORG-9] data that you have in cloud storage, such as [ORG-10] data from your website via a [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: And then pretty much anything else that you have, [ORG-4] or otherwise, that's relevant to that definition of who a customer is. So we ingest that data either via what we call ETL pathways or zero ETL pathways.
Agent: Something we'll talk a little bit more about is our ability to natively query data that lives in warehouses.
Agent: So if you have product usage data or data science metrics, and that live in BigQuery or stuff like you query those where they live, as opposed to having to move that data into [ORG-1].
Agent: So we ingest it, we transform it to make sure that the data looks and feels the way that we expect it to.
Agent: And then using a declarative out of the box rules, we unify all these different sources down into one single customer profile right here, which we would consider our true like golden record across all of your customer facing sources.
Agent: Once we have that golden record, a lot of things we can do and create new insights off of the data.
Agent: And I know that y'all have a propensity to churn score, but could be the creation of like a product usage score or a health score, something like that. We can run [PRODUCT-2] on top of the data.
Agent: And then we can take action off of it. And action can take a number of forms that could be activation to an email platform, activation to advertising, and also activation back into [ORG-1].
Agent: So as we think about it, we Unify data together. If we understand maybe [PERSON-8], we stream in that propensity to churn score. That churn score goes below, I don't know, below a certain threshold, somewhat likely to churn.
Agent: We can send them an email. Or if it's critical enough, we can action a task directly in the [PRODUCT-3] for a person to pick up the phone and call them.
Agent: So as we're thinking about this, we unified the data, create insights off the data, and then we do something with it.
Agent: So it's designed to be a very active platform, triggering email communications, triggering tasks, Cases to our build-to-market teams. And then the final thing that I wanted to touch on is analytics too.
Agent: So it can power true unified analytics off of this, can power those within [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: So like I said, I'm logging on, can see a dashboard of, How many times that a key customer has logged in [DATE-4], how many emails they've sent, name, whatever metric, and also more like broad Enterprise wide analytics as well.
Agent: So it can be really focused on the customer or broad across all sources. So we've got a pause here. This is what [ORG-11] does.
Agent: And as we think, again, about bridging to warehouse with what we're doing in [ORG-1], this is somewhat how we action off of it.
Agent: Do you have any questions, feedback, thoughts on this?
EndUser: Well, I definitely like the concept and you know, the idea of being able to ingest a lot of different types of data because ultimately that's what we need.
EndUser: But then being able to make sense of it like the story you're telling makes a lot of sense. I did have a technical question without trying to go down the rabbit hole too much.
EndUser: I see the the APIs and the SDKs versus out of the box.
Agent: Connectors,
EndUser: It looks like connectors It looks like data might be getting fanned out or pushed to other places.
Agent: On the right hand side.
EndUser: Are these question... different mechanisms over here, because I can see like data export, SQL, so-called REST APIs, but then that segment and activate.
EndUser: Like how does it get from there to the right?
Agent: Great question, [PERSON-1]. So what we're looking at on the left is really just ingestion of sources. Consider that your source data that's relevant in that definition.
Agent: Once we create them those unified profiles, as far as segmentation and activation, that's a core use case, you create a list of people just like Marketing would do who haven't logged in [DATE-5] whose churn score has gone above 100.
Agent: And then you activate that. We have out of the box connectors for activation as well. You activate that to a Marketing platform.
Agent: That could be our Marketing cloud, that could be you know, [ORG-9], that could be via [ORG-14] pretty much anywhere. Anywhere Okay.
EndUser: To that point, right?
Agent: And you can also as we're thinking about more like BI or analytics use cases. [PERSON-9] is an out of the box connection.
Agent: You don't need to write SQL [PERSON-10], but if for instance you wanted to like hook up Power BI or you know an external analytics platform or do something with that underlying data, we also support.
Agent: Like SQL access to it So you can query those unified individual record s and then use those for whatever type of [PERSON-11] s or BI or whatever that you wanna run .
EndUser: Awesome. Yeah, definitely you.
Agent: Answer. Yep. Thank words.
EndUser: Yeah, go
Agent: And yeah, one thing that I
Agent: Meant, so [PERSON-3], when we talked [DATE-6], we talked about this idea of being able to slot [ORG-8] in to help really solve that the primary challenge that [PERSON-14] is having, which is really around data and how that can be used and slotted into your current stack.
Agent: And so we don't have to go and rip and replace like your current Messaging platform, right?
Agent: Which is loved by multiple people within the organization. With that said though, we can build that foundation and then we can look at like the system of engagement as a secondary step if needed.
Agent: Maybe assignment needed at all, right So the idea with this as a phase one that we can really fix that data related [ORG-9] e without having to do a lot on that syste m of engagement concept .
Agent: Yeah, yeah, that's great.
EndUser: So you talk a little more about
EndUser: So, I guess the current reality [DATE-1]. Like my team would be the data sharing partners in the box. Yeah, sitting on [QUANTITY-1] of information.
Agent: We're
EndUser: Yeah, We've gotten small pieces of it pushed to [ORG-1].
Agent: It's there.
Agent: Yep. Like [ORG-13].
EndUser: Is there?
EndUser: Like we struggle to reveal that data can you talk a little bit about how that works?
Agent: More places. So Yeah, so two comments on that. And this is generally like what I hear from everyone. It's like we have a lot of stuff in the warehouse. We want to bring it to the [PERSON-9] market teams.
Agent: How do we actually make that easy?
Agent: How do we do that?
Agent: So two things I'm gonna say, the first is, the zero [ORG-6] connections that we have specifically now. We can get into the mechanics of this a little later on, but with [ORG-13].
Agent: As we think about not physically moving data, from [ORG-10] into our solution, we can query it where it lives. I want to be clear that that's currently in pilot.
Agent: We expect that to be live around [DATE-7]. Both [ORG-13] [DATE-1] do have a query level access to [ORG-8] data.
Agent: The reverse of that, we expect to be live around [DATE-7]. So end is your day.
Agent: About it like we don't leave tables, we're not moving data from the warehouse into our solutio n and having to use forces of truth . Yeah. So that's kind of like the front end of that.
Agent: The back end of it, which is like, how do we actually do something with this?
Agent: So we talked about email activation. But as we think about [ORG-1], [ORG-8] is an application, and we'll see this, but [ORG-8] is an application built into [ORG-1].
Agent: And so what that means is we have native automation and I'll call it enrichment pathways. So automation would be in terms of triggering, again, a task, a case, an opportunity off of some insight that's stored in [ORG-8].
Agent: Enrichment would be a more traditional like [ORG-6], like filling a field from that source data.
Agent: So instead of having to use like, you know, [ORG-14] or something to pipe an insight from [ORG-13], you would store that in [LOC-1], something that's designed to really store that level of data, and then we can proliferate that up to [PRODUCT-3] where your, you know, [ORG-5] sales people, whoever are working.
Agent: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah, we have like both of those needs, kind of the visibility side and then we do want to trigger cases. Yeah.
Agent: And there's somewhat different pathways. Like there's both real-time into this of, you know, insight streams in change data trigger. And then there's also the more batch style up.
EndUser: We have both. It really just depends on the use case. Some we'd want. I would think most we would probably okay batch style, things that upon change we'd want to take an action.
Agent: But there's certain
Agent: Yep. So like in our story, which again I know it was a story, but like a use case that I think the main real-time thing that I touched on was like someone views cancellation.
Agent: On the website, if our web SDK picks up that, someone's on the cancellation page, we stream that in and then immediately stream to a [ORG-5]. Whereas like, maybe a score doesn't need to be quite as immediately reactive.
Agent: So just that was my POV on it. Y'all, you know, your business is better than me, but that was something I would view as needing to be truly real-time versus [TIME-1] funny.
EndUser: Later. Yeah, yeah, that's a good example. That's team lead mentioned that to me [DATE-8].
Agent: Our mom's
EndUser: Like I see people looking at cancel pages.
Agent: Yeah, we
EndUser: Don't know anything about it right now.
Agent: [ORG-1] does this in less of a friendly customer success way. When people view pricing pages, our reps get plaque notifications. So if you all go and look at Data Cloud pricing on the website, like Yeah.
EndUser: Our sales reach. Be careful.
Agent: Fish in on the air.
Agent: [PERSON-7]'s going to be picking up the phone and calling So any other questions on this?
Agent: You. You can get it right out for this.
Agent: Does it make sense?
Agent: Cool. So I have a few more slides on like use Cases and things like that. I understand you probably want to see it to understand a little better.
Agent: So I'm hoping to get [TIME-2] for our demo at the end of this just to help you understand. But as we're going, again, please continue asking questions.
Agent: One thing I think is really important to bring up is just the partnerships that we have.
Agent: I touched on a couple of these, but as we think about the reason that [ORG-1] is solution in this space is particularly powerful. Zero-Tail data access, like I mentioned, again, [DATE-9] of that.
Agent: Hyperscalers referencing Data Cloud data live [DATE-1]. The other half of that we expect to be live around [DATE-7], which would be [ORG-8] referencing warehouse data.
Agent: We have bring your own [PRODUCT-2] integrations, which just went live [DATE-10] with [ORG-18] [PRODUCT-4] and [ORG-18].
Agent: I'm not sure if you use either of these, and for your actual predictive modeling, but both of those tools can use your ETL reference to data and data cloud, train models, and then pipe those insights back in to append into that unified profile.
Agent: So, I saw you came up with you.
Agent: Do you use either of these?
Agent: Well, no. Okay. That's not okay. Yeah. Basically, just cloud modeling environments. Just schedule
EndUser: Our runs and what. a doctor.
Agent: Okay, fair enough. So something to think about if this was.
EndUser: I'll call you. Or. Gotcha.
Agent: And then we can also activate. We have advertising partners for, you know, pushing. Pushing to advertising if that would be for.
EndUser: Yeah, I know [DATE-1] we do some stuff where. We have like manual uploads into like basically giving the labs feedback. Like they brought us people. then [ORG-16] Ads wants to know how did this turn out.
Agent: It's like
EndUser: A sheet upload.
Agent: One
EndUser: Time we looked into doing it via API, but the API was like really gnarly. So then we'd be like, well, we could just keep doing the sheet. It takes [TIME-3].
Agent: So
EndUser: What were these arrows doing?
EndUser: Here's my question.
Agent: So it's actually bidirectional with specifically [ORG-18] and [ORG-16]. So we can launch audiences, we create a segment, and then launch the audience into [ORG-16] Ads and [ORG-18] Ads. They'll actually return data.
Agent: Which is a unique thing that I think only we have currently. They'll provide you aggregate level information about who they understand those people to be.
Agent: So if you activate a segment of like, I don't know, hyperpensity to upgrade to keep [ORG-13] to [ORG-16] ads, they'll return some information about who they know those people are at the aggregate level.
Agent: So that's why the arrows going back the other direction, if that makes sense. Yeah.
EndUser: I've always on automate this stuff, but Marketing typically likes to, really manually manage it.
Agent: Yeah, they're And in some of this, right?
EndUser: Comfortable.
Agent: Like, you know, is we talk a lot with [PERSON-3] about, you know, what is comfortable, what does the future look like?
Agent: As we think about messaging, we talked about, you know, it's possible that Marketing wants to continue kind of doing its demand gen stuff in [ORG-9], and maybe we have more of a customer success use case for email, which we're going to activate out of this more like, proactive retention Messaging versus the more like demand-gen oriented messaging.
Agent: That's a future conversation we can have.
Agent: But this, as we think about Marketing activations, can someone exist independently of, you know, another USB?
Agent: So just something to broadly. introduce.
Agent: And then this is, I think y'all generally get the concept by this point, but as I was thinking about all the sources that we might use in this single definition of who county consultant is, Marketing data, website data, inclusive of [ORG-4], product data certainly living in [GPE-1] and BigQuery, [ORG-1] data, service cloud, cases, things like that.
Agent: And then I don't know if you have any third party enrichment [DATE-1]. This is a common one I'll see is like using that enrichment data in something like this, but these are all the sources.
Agent: That I had originally thought of that might be relevant to the single definition. I'm sur e y'all could come up with more, but thought this might be . a good place to start.
Agent: Questions, comments on this?
Agent: All right, so really our vision for how this gets used. And a lot of this was demonstrated through the story. But the concept is we unify all these metrics from these sources.
Agent: And then we provide, at least in the first phase, really two main use cases, which I've really touched on. The first is retention-oriented messaging.
Agent: People haven't logged in, people haven't used features, push them towards those features, push them to log back in.
Agent: And then if we have particularly high value customers or people who maybe need a little bit more that human touch use some of those automation pathways into [ORG-1] to provide task cases, whatever it's a [ORG-5]'s who need to pick up the phone or even coaches in the onboarding process, you know, to pick up the phone, give them a call and let them know that they're there to help them out.
Agent: And I think probably our hypothesis is that by doing this more in real time, you know, you're actually reacting to You know what customers are doing versus you know hitting them [DATE-5] a month late We were trying to get in front of these Signals from customers that they might share and then use that to more proactively retain them Comments on this or does this make sense
Agent: Cool Yeah, this
EndUser: Makes sense. I would say, yeah, that's a direction our [ORG-5]. team wants to move in. Something else they're also interested in is more of like I want to say standardization of the [ORG-5]. activities and tasks.
Agent: Because
EndUser: [DATE-11] each one just kind of does their own thing. So, you know, if those tasks, if you're not [PERCENT-1] of their work is going to be like, you know, program for them.
EndUser: But, there were some way of, you know, you're listening to these signals and you're breaking out these Cases in a consistent way.
Agent: Yep, if
Agent: Just, you know,
Agent: Absolutely.
Agent: And that's like, you know, it's not going to solve everything in that, but like, maybe it's a framework for them of like, when you get the case, you pick up the phone and you call someone because they might be about to turn, you know, it's a easy slam down to get in front of something there.
Agent: And so just to briefly remind you of what we talked about in our story before you get to the demo to ground, we talked about like feature driven messaging.
Agent: You understand that someone has an adopted email Marketing within keep zero emails, provide them, you know, keep academy courses and just little nudges towards, you know, towards using those features.
Agent: We talked about segmentation and activation in reaction to churns course. So if someone is highly likely to churn and they're a fairly high value customer.
Agent: We're going to activate again Messaging to them or signals to their [ORG-5] to pick up the phone and call them. And then the last thing is really the enrichment of [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: And these are just visuals that can sexualize what we just talked about, but like bringing those tasks in cases, bringing those insights that we're creating, all those things, bringing those into the [PRODUCT-3] console where they can access them without having to go to another system to learn to know what they need to know.
Agent: So these are really the three use Cases I'll like touch on in the demo as well, but just thought it might be helpful to briefly read around and like what we talked about in our story and our read back.
Agent: Questions on this or shall we dive in and actually see some software?
Agent: Okay, beautiful. Dive Yeah.
EndUser: In.
Agent: Wonderful. Thanks [PERSON-3]. Cool. And as I'm going like please again, don't hesitate to ask questions. You're all very smart people, you understand this kind of stuff. I want you to actually understand it.
Agent: So what we're looking at here, this is our [ORG-8] home page. So data cloud, even though it's architected a little bit differently to the rest of [ORG-1], like I mentioned, has that more big data component to it.
Agent: Even though it has that, it's just an application within [ORG-1], just like [LOC-2], just like Service Cloud.
Agent: So really what that means is all this data is stored in the place, [ORG-18] is the same, Support is the same, and your key customer definition can be stored in the same place.
Agent: And so if we think about that diagram that we saw from left to right, everything Data Cloud starts with data ingestion.
Agent: We have to reach out to those different sources and grab the data, or in the case of [ORG-23], query the data where it lives. And we do that through what we call data streams.
Agent: And so I've dropped just a few, and I'm going to zoom in here slightly, realize I'm at the counter-art to see. I was on [PERCENT-2] for some reason.
Agent: As I think about data streams, really what we're seeing here just representations of those that I mentioned on the last slide. Here's some product usage data from [ORG-25]Agent: Maybe some [ORG-9] engagement data, web engagement, data science metrics, and which are maybe coming from big query.
Agent: We reach out to all these sources via, again, what we call our data streams, reach out to them, determine what tables of data we want to bring in, or directly access.
Agent: And so these are the connectors that we offer out of the box. Marketing Cloud, [PRODUCT-3], we offer a mobile and web SDK for engagement data, and ingestion API for data from maybe more agnostic sources.
Agent: And then our cloud storage connectors, in addition to SFTP.
Agent: And I think every source that we had mentioned is covered by one of these connectors, but if there is data from outside of it, we can also connect to a tool like [PERSON-13] or really any other [ORG-6] tool to provide more flexible data input from anywhere.
Agent: Again, most of the sources we were discussing, [ORG-26], pretty much all covered, but regardless, you know, just wanted to bring up the concept.
Agent: So high level, we authenticate to these tools, determine what tables of data that we want to ingest, and then bring them in. And so once we bring them in, we have to actually map that data.
Agent: We have to understand from these source systems, what is an individual, what is a churn score. And so we do that using what we call data mappings.
Agent: And so for each of those sources that we saw, [ORG-8] ships within out of the [ORG-25] data model for what is an individual, what is an account, which is entirely customizable.
Agent: So what we're seeing here is on the left, we ingest data from Snowflake for keep product usage, and then we map it to our source data model.
Agent: So over here we have again like maybe, I don't know, a number of logins, a number of emails which we're ingesting from a warehouse. We bring that in and we map that to our data model.
Agent: Then once we have all that data mapped, it's logically understood our connections between these source tables have been defined, and we can start crunching them down to one single definition of a key customer.
Agent: Any questions up to now?
EndUser: Yeah, I was going to ask a quick question here.
Agent: The receiving
EndUser: Side, it's almost like the canonical model that you mentioned before, right?
EndUser: The target.
EndUser: Are those defined as like S-object metadata?
EndUser: And the reason I ask is because is there a way to aggregate multiple sources into that single canonical target?
Agent: And the answer to that is yes, [PERSON-1]. So we, like I mentioned, it's a similar object model to like normal [ORG-1].
EndUser: And then you have objects
Agent: And you have fields contained within them. Again, we ship out of the box with maybe 51, which are like individual accounts. This is a product usage one that I have here.
Agent: But we can hook multiple different sources up to each of those objects. And so as you think about your definition of an individual, like maybe you have [ORG-1] data playing into that, maybe you have.
Agent: Have something from your warehouse playing into that They can both map to the same object And then what we'll see next is our actually identity resolutio n process, which helps crunch them all dow n into one usable definition .
Agent: So my short answer to your question is yes. That was a little additional context, but.
EndUser: Very cool.
Agent: Yeah, no worries.
Agent: Any additional questions on this?
Agent: Is there a way?
EndUser: So on the right hand side, that's. what someone has decided this will be on our golden record.
Agent: These are the things we
EndUser: Want on there.
EndUser: Then is there a way for the end user to see the source of these fields?
Agent: So, got what's that called data lineage, is it, [PERSON-8]?
EndUser: Kind of like data, Yeah, and not even more thinking. We run into a lot of questions where, if you pull a metric from here or from there, know, different numbers because there's just system of record.
Agent: You know, you a different
EndUser: I would say just a really high level, like this came from the data science team came from, I don't know, [ORG-20] or, Yeah.
Agent: Or this
Agent: You know, just something. So a couple of thoughts on that. We don't yet have like classical data lineage capabilities within the product.
Agent: That is something actually that's on our roadmap in [DATE-14], which is just, you know, where do fields come from?
Agent: Things I'll see customers do with this. One is you could include something like that if you knew where it was coming from, like in the field name.
Agent: So is only coming from [ORG-25], then you could map it in there.
EndUser: If your propensity for insurance
Agent: But one other thing I'll say, and this, I think this teased me up pretty well. I'll just briefly touch on this. We also offer data transformations. So.
Agent: If you ingest data from sources who want SQL based or drag and drop builder to [ORG-29] the data, we can do that Not much more to say it On it than that .
Agent: We can also decide and like which from those source systems if we have multiple playing into a single field Which one that we want to prioritize in that final goal of the record?
Agent: So what we're seeing here are what we call our identity resolutions I'm gonna we have a set of match rules and a set of reconciliation rules [PERSON-13] essentially help us decide which fields which identifier should we use to define this single individual.
Agent: So you can see here like if we have table like tables from seven data from seven different tables forgive me.
Agent: How do we decide how to crunch them down?
Agent: We'll match based on exact name and email maybe a fuzzy name a fuzzy email. and we can match on any field.
Agent: So if you all ship a persistent identifier across all these sources of, I don't know exactly what that might Not yet.
EndUser: Be. Yeah, definitely.
Agent: But, but, That's Okay.
EndUser: Probably interesting. I hope.
Agent: But if that were a thing, we could also use that identifier.
Agent: So as it stands right now, we could look across these different tables, match based on email, match based on a Salesforce ID, that persistent ID like we mentioned. These rules are flexible, they're configurable.
Agent: It really just help us determine, you know, across all these source systems, how do we crunch it down?
Agent: And normally what I find is like the B2C versus B2B use case for this.
Agent: Generally, I find my B2B companies have a little bit cleaner data that you do have a fairly reliable identifier across all these different sources that can be used.
Agent: But in those Cases where you don't, we also offer some probabilistic, so like fuzzy name, fuzzy email in case people <inaudible>-fingered. And in our next couple releases, again, for the statement, we expect to ship fuzzy on any field.
Agent: So questions on that?
EndUser: Without getting too much into the weeds.
EndUser: When we were looking at the mapping, during transformation to do aggregates so we could produce keys?
Agent: Is there a way
Agent: Yes, [PERSON-1], you could.
EndUser: Okay, cool.
Agent: Great question. Thank you. And then, and this is, this is the thing that I have that like kind of answers your in it your earlier question, which is what we call our reconciliation rules.
Agent: So this essentially helps us determine if we have, you know, seven pieces of data from seven input systems, how do we determine which one wins out in that final golden record?
Agent: We're going to keep all of them. We're going to keep a record of all of them.
Agent: We're not getting rid of any data, but how do we determine which is the, you know, the canonical, the golden, And our reconciliation rules help us determine that.
Agent: So if we had, for instance, a couple of different definitions for first name, for product addition, I think you get the general idea, we can prioritize based on the most frequently occurring that from a source system.
Agent: So if you know a specific system has the true source of truth or what a churn score is, that can prioritize from that source. We can also choose, again, that most frequently occurring. or the most recently updated.
Agent: But I typically find customers using frequency or. source prioritization. So basically, this handles in just zooming out a little bit, like thinking about a customer trying to build this definition themselves. This handles a lot of that logic.
Agent: So all those joins that you would normally have to be doing between various tables of data from [ORG-4], from product usage, from [ORG-1].
Agent: This handles all that logic for how do we join these tables, what identifier do we use, and then in that final definition, what fields do we keep in prioritize. All that logic is happening here behind the scenes.
Agent: And this is again. an entirely declarative interface. We do Support SQL if you really want a direct SQL, but we fin d it most customers like the declarative point-click .
Agent: And what we can see here, just to, I think you get the idea, but to send the point home is that we've taken about 75 million source profiles, so 75 million source records, and we've crunched them down into about 37 million two unified profiles.
Agent: So we're taking all of this data and then building it into 37 million composite profiles to then do stuff with. And as I come up with you.
EndUser: Oh, yeah.
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: Okay. Take it, appreciate it. So, um, this is interesting. We, um,
EndUser: At one point, when we have not had bandwidth, we, we basically wanted to build this as a service.
Agent: Yeah. For the company
EndUser: Where we did unify. The records from our many places. Do some basically. matching, fuzzy matching, generate a unique identifier for each person and then push that, you know, or wherever they needed to go. But, um, maybe accomplish that.
Agent: Let's It is a beast to try to do that yourself. And I have customers too.
Agent: And one thing I want to be clear on is I have customers who have done some of that, who consider themselves to have the golden record in the warehouse.
Agent: This is just the front half of this product, which is very much around the data governance. The back half is around the activation. And that's where I think that this comes in.
Agent: We're like a warehouse, never can, is like how do we actually take action and near real-time on this data?
Agent: So not only are we providing that upfront governance, it's also the doing something with the data.
Agent: And I was going to also mention too, [PERSON-6] and I, we've had conversations with agencies that have been very interested in these type of capabilities for their customers, right?
Agent: So they want to be able to ingest data from different [ORG-1] tenants and then be able to use this type of capabilities then to surface real meaningful audiences and segments and to use that to essentially build just better, more capable services back to their customer.
Agent: So within [PRODUCT-5], you can create like works different workspaces almost like logical separations.
Agent: So you keep
Agent: Customer data separate and compliant . there's lots of different way s that you can potentially leverage this , something to keep in mind for down the road .
Agent: Yeah, like I don't think that you all would end up doing this. Sorry, I just want to get to that. Oh, my fault. I was just going to say like really quick, y'all might.
Agent: You could make the decision to like keep partner from keep customer data separate. I know that there is overlap between the two. Like customers are often also partners and maybe vice versa.
Agent: So that could be an option if you felt that was necessary. Often like is [ORG-37] could just be a field within this that we used to define who is in [ORG-37].
Agent: But that could be a use case for what [PERSON-7] described. Apologies, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: No, you were definitely headed down the same path I was thought process because I was going to bring up partner there's a difference in the information we want to know about a partner and then the information we need to cultivate and put through Some kind of process like this and then get back in their hands So that they have the power of what the engine is producing for their own cells and Marketing efforts as well So there's more than one use case hidden underneath all that partner.
Agent: But
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, [PERSON-8]. Um, so in [PERSON-1], that's like the last use case we talked about in our story was like y'all running Marketing on behalf of partners.
EndUser: Mm hmm.
Agent: What you have this data, you can choose to do it with what you want. You know, you could like hand partners list, but like I also think potentially interesting Revenue stream is like you have the source data.
Agent: You could do some Marketing on behalf of customers and almost like in not quite like an agency style fashion, but it's like you have it.
Agent: You can run campaigns against it's that there's a lot of things you can do when you have this data That's one thing we again hypothesize but like certainly you're heading down the right path it.
EndUser: Right. So
EndUser: And with the right people in the room, they might see a way to monetize that as And then the different partner levels and what that means and how deep that partnership goes you access to and for how much.
Agent: Well Right .
Agent: And what it gives Absolutely. And you could all have a little framework around that and then start charging a little bit for some Marketing and then partners benefit because they get more customers.
Agent: So, I'm going to keep moving because halfway through the demo.
EndUser: We're only about
Agent: I want to leave [PERSON-7] [TIME-4] at the end. So, hopefully, the next part is that the good thing is we're past the nitty gritty data stuff and now it's like we have our beautiful.
Agent: What we'll build in record, what do we do with And so the first thing that we can do with it, like I mentioned, is create what we call calculated insights.
EndUser: It?
Agent: It's possible that you're shipping these insights from external systems, but we can also create them within ours.
Agent: So common use Cases we'll see is like a number of logins in [DATE-9], login frequency, you're gonna aggregate all that product data to make a single metric that then someone can use on a profile to trigger an email, et cetera.
Agent: This can include ranking customers, grouping customers.
Agent: Customers, bucketing them, aggregating [PERSON-1] to your point There's really a lot of things we can do And within these insights, we Support SQL You know, it could write SQL It's really more SQL given its sales force But can write SQL to create them in We also offer this drag and drop builder As you can see So what we're doing here is we're joining data .
Agent: Product usage data on logins with what addition that the customer has from [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: We joined that to our unified individual, run a couple aggregates, and then we have at the end of this, oops, how many times that customer has logged in [DATE-9].
Agent: So we're gonna take all that source data and then just crunch it down over time to produce that insight. A fair amount of these, calculating customer lifetime value.
Agent: Again, bucketing, creating engagement scores, product usage scores, there's really no limit to what you can do with these. Really, just creation of drive metrics, which you can then use downstream.
Agent: And the way that we use those downstream is really, really twofold. And so this is our interface for segmentation and activation.
Agent: So this would be an example of pulling a list of customers who haven't done certain things and then triggering emails or Marketing against them.
Agent: And so within our segmentation interface, we have, I want to be clear, when we generally think about segmentation, that's like marketing-centric, but there's also customer success angles to this.
Agent: We have access to all that source data that we have in unified individual. I can include a keep [ORG-31] start date, a [ORG-37] status, potentially, and then really any of those insights that we're creating here.
Agent: So a couple examples that I built for our demo [DATE-1] is if we used one of those calculated insights to aggregate how many times that a customer has logged in the last [ORG-33] period of time can drag those in.
Agent: And I should be clear, I created this segment is like people who haven't used email Marketing within Keep, but we can extend it a little bit more broadly. So you can just drag this over.
Agent: People whose logins last seven is less than maybe five. Then we've added all people who are not liking into the key product.
Agent: If we had, again, [PERSON-8] told me we had a little side conversation in our own site that they are creating this propensity to churns for [DATE-1], not necessarily automating off of it.
Agent: If a customer's propensity to churns score is less, I guess it'd probably be greater, is greater than 100. And then we've pulled in all customers who are very likely to turn.
EndUser: Because essentially you're taking right now and starting to filter down based on a set of different kind of qualifiers.
Agent: Yeah, it's basically you know, set into Okay.
EndUser: Any data that's sitting there that's already being, this normalized model.
Agent: You got it. Yep. And you take them this too to like actual product data itself.
Agent: Again, some use Cases that I thought about if we're doing an email Marketing oriented segment, we want to pull on all people who's one person who's emails sent in [DATE-9] is equal to zero.
Agent: People aren't sending emails. People aren't logging in. I think you give the general idea up of groups of customers who meet specific criteria and then activate Messaging against them.
EndUser: To this point. But there's a group
Agent: And these segments are going to update. You can set that interval [TIME-5]. And so it's going to basically just re-query [TIME-6]. And then when new customers meet this, they'll be automatically included in the segment.
Agent: And then if you have this matched up to a piece of messaging, it'll automatically be triggered. And I should just be clear, this is less relevant to y'all, but we offer both include and exclude.
Agent: So if maybe you didn't want to waste your time on anyone who has a really low key Contract value, I don't actually know what that Contract value is. You can exclude people as well.
Agent: And as we think about suppression, I can also reference different lists. So if you have people who, across channels, have indicated, hey, I don't want to be targeted by key messaging, can also suppress people from these communications too.
Agent: Now, clear with Sorry, what was that?
EndUser: The correct value.
EndUser: That's great with the partner side of the business. A lot of partners do not want to keep sending emails to the customers that they have.
Agent: Yeah. So, you know, if we had a, I don't know, like someone, this is an active [ORG-37] field, but if was currently being assisted by [ORG-37] equals yes, we'll exclude them
EndUser: Information. Exactly.
EndUser: Yeah. And then go
EndUser: With just this parent. Mm-hmm.
Agent: Yep. And so this is in terms of segmentation. I'm going to get to the actual email component here in a moment, but one had to also touch on that actual contact record itself, how we can enrich it.
Agent: So this looks probably very different than the old [ORG-1] contact record. I haven't had the chance to get in and see it yet. But really going to use this more to paint broadly on what we've done.
Agent: And so like I mentioned, there's really two ways that we can integrate. The first is in terms of automation, triggering off of change data. If someone's propensity to charge score goes above certain thing, create a task.
Agent: And also just in terms of field enrichment. So that like when a [ORG-5] or Sales rep logs in to [PRODUCT-3], they can see that underlying data that we're creating in [ORG-8].
Agent: And so this is just an example of [ORG-29] consultant profile record queue. And what we're seeing is that we're aggregating data for [ORG-29] across service, across marketing, and across product.
Agent: We're bringing up those calculated insights that we created for her, for how many emails she's sending, how high her turn score is, maybe how many logins she has [DATE-13]. And then we're also creating Cases off of it.
Agent: So we're going to initiate a case via what we call a data action when her turn score goes above 68.
Agent: And so when I'm talking about enriching this profile too, we can also, I don't believe that y'all used to upload it [DATE-1], but I thought I would at least speak to it. We can also enrich it with dashboards.
Agent: So if you wanted to, we can keep track of data over time. If you wanted to understand customer health, logins, whatever, in more of a graphical fashion time series, then we can also produce analytics off of it.
Agent: This is an example of one of those dashboards. [ORG-29]'s health score is [DATE-13]. Her logins over time have actually gone up in this visual, but will pretend that they went down. This is her utilization across all these features.
Agent: You can layer analytics over that underlying [ORG-8] data too and really just bring it to a [PRODUCT-3] console or for a [ORG-5], the salesperson, whatever to have.
Agent: So going to pause here briefly before touching on the Messaging component.
Agent: Any questions on this?
Agent: Does this concept make sense?
EndUser: Absolutely makes amazing.
EndUser: Sense. Yeah. Pretty
EndUser: Do you find when you're doing the segmentation, I know you were saying you can set up the segments and then those can be stored and then as data flows in, it's going to set.
Agent: Go through that rule
EndUser: Do you also find that you have actually end users that want to do a little question, a little Q and A with the system from time to time and they want to just segment and see idea without actually necessarily making it actionable yet.
Agent: So they can kind of get an
Agent: Yeah, exploration is absolutely a use case as well. Can we offer, I'm gonna just briefly tease this. I don't need to, what is, I think it's in here under [PERSON-9] Insights.
Agent: I don't need to go to this to in depth. But we also offer what we call segment intelligence, which basically is that we create a segment of people who maybe are like high value-keep customers.
Agent: I don't know exactly what. But it'll layer over that segment and also provide you like related data about those people. So as we think about this, let's see, where's OK, this is the dashboard here.
Agent: So if we create a list of customers who we know are high value for keep, it'll also be able to surface all those related components about them too.
Agent: So where do high value keep customers?
Agent: Where do their product users scores fall?
Agent: Where do they tend to exist within the country?
Agent: We don't have just access to the pieces. When we're segmenting, we don't have access just to the things we're segmenting on. It's all of that underlying data.
Agent: And so as far as exploration and understanding your customers better, this is a great way to do it. And you can understand them better across all those sources.
Agent: So if we brought in [ORG-4] data, you pull in the highest healthy, the steep customers of the highest health score. You then kind of cross-reference that with like how many [ORG-4] courses that they've taken.
Agent: And then you can start to provide like tangible metrics on taking 57 [ORG-4] courses makes you [PERCENT-3] more likely to stick with Keep after [DATE-14]. You probably have some of that already.
Agent: But as a concept, this would make it a lot easier to get that insight versus join data across like a bajillion different tables.
EndUser: Not to mention the ability to take a hunch and kind of validate that or actually validate that with real data.
Agent: And I want to be clear too, like this is something that we have with [PERSON-9] and [ORG-29].
EndUser: Net underlying
Agent: Data is also accessible to, we have a, god, what is it?
Agent: I think it's a Python connector that can get data to like Power BI or another visualization tool. What I'm specifically showing here is being powered by [PERSON-9].
Agent: But we can somewhat Support a little frankly less high performance, but can somewhat Support with external tools as well.
EndUser: So I just want
Agent: Something I wanted to call out.
Agent: So now to real quick here, as far as, if you watch anything from [ORG-33] in [DATE-13], you'll see a lot about AI in the next generation of [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: So generative AI specifically, you will see from a segmentation perspective, based on the roadmap, I think, layer for [DATE-18], that marketers or team members can actually create segments of audiences using generative prompts, instead of actually the drag and drop.
Agent: So
Agent: There'll be a lot of really interesting capabilities coming into the way that you're you segment your audiences in the near future .
EndUser: Right. You don't always have to know the question if you've got [PRODUCT-2] helping interesting points of interest.
Agent: You identify
Agent: Correct.
Agent: I don't have that in this demo or, but basically you're out of type, like, give me everyone who has to eat [PERSON-14] who is not a [ORG-37] who, whatever, you know, you get the concept, but instead of having a drag and drop and like somewhat understanding that underlying data model, if you can just type it and it'll produce the second for you, which is cool.
EndUser: Super
Agent: Cool. So last thing I wanted to touch on, take [TIME-4], um, consider it a little bit of a, a, for what we can do with our own Marketing solution.
Agent: So as you think about email activation, what we do is we take this segment and we match. to an activation .
Agent: We do have an out of the box connector with our own [PRODUCT-6] solution for journeys create for journeys, emails, et cetera. And so I just wanted to briefly touch on it.
Agent: [ORG-51] introduced that we can work with externally as these two, but [PERSON-3], I know that as we were thinking about, potentially, who owns this, who uses this, whatever, that this could be an avenue that we explored.
Agent: So broadly, this is Marketing cloud, sorry, multi-channel [ORG-31] platform. Have email, mobile, advertising all in one place, as opposed to using different tools for all of those.
Agent: I'm just going to briefly touch on, I think, a specific use case for us, which is activating a journey when a customer doesn't use a specific feature.
Agent: What I've done is basically just created a high level, how do we react when a customer isn't using keep the way that we want them to?
Agent: So what happens is we take that segment that we created back here. Yeah, we take the segment and then we pop it into Marketing cloud, which has a relational database sitting underneath it.
Agent: And then we can use all that underlying data to influence how this journey personalizes to each individual. So we bring in all those people who have lower attention scores.
Agent: We can use what we call decisions, but it's to influence what path that they go down. If they have [PERSON-13] versus [PERSON-18], they get an entirely different experience.
Agent: If their score is between 26 and 57, maybe we just need to send them an email. But if it's between 0 and 26, we'll send them an email.
Agent: And if they don't click on that, we'll fire a task back into [PRODUCT-3] for like a, you know, [ORG-5] to pick up the phone and call them again. So, broadly we're.
Agent: Marketing or Messaging to customers, I should say, but we're also keeping human beings in the loop on what's happening via task cases, et cetera. We can fire those off from [PRODUCT-6] as well.
Agent: And something that I wanted to touch on too, entirely drag and drop here, have [PRODUCT-2] built into it for like send time optimization, sure messages are hitting customers when they want to receive them, increasing open rates.
Agent: We can also really [ORG-29] the individual messages themselves.
Agent: So just going to touch on this briefly, but we have access to all that underlying [ORG-1] data, which we can then use to change how the individual email message is received as well.
Agent: So we can include what we call personalization strings here, include first names, additions, number of emails, sent, et cetera.
Agent: We can also do what we call dynamic content, which will change the message within the email depending on who that customer is and how they're engaging.
Agent: So what I've built here, high level, is if we infer in Data Cloud that someone isn't using a particular feature well, maybe that's keep pipeline, maybe it's keep email, you get the general idea.
Agent: We can create one email message that's going to target them differently depending on what that next best course, next best. Next best keep [ORG-34] class is. So if someone's next best course equals keep pipeline, they'll get this.
Agent: If it equals automation, they'll get this. And so really, we can create one version of this journey that's going to change for every person who receives it.
Agent: And this is just a manifestation that I have in here is essentially a segment that I popped over from [ORG-8]. for [PERSON-18], who has sent 2,954 emails, has 37 propensity to churn.
Agent: She's getting recommended to keep automation because she's not using that well. Sergeant getting recommended key pipeline. You get the concept by now, but we can basically change that message that recommended next best action to the customer.
Agent: At the individual level. Instead of thinking about scaling those efforts, not having to create like 1,000 different versions of an email for each [ORG-4] course.
Agent: We can somewhat dynamically create one version, which is then going to [ORG-29] at the individual level to what that Keep customer means. And so this is really all I plan to show [DATE-1].
Agent: I know this is really a tease of the Marketing at the end, but just a way that we can think about how to message the customers off of it.
Agent: But we saw aggregating data, creating insights off of that data, bringing that data to [PRODUCT-3], and then triggering Messaging off of it via a segmentation approach.
Agent: Just want to pause any [TIME-7] questions before I turn it back over to [PERSON-7].
EndUser: I have one question.
EndUser: If we step back for the whole ingestion piece know, the canonical models getting created and then we can make things actionable and then we found our cell phone with Marketing cloud, which is a really purposeable tool for a specific kind of department and, you know, strategy.
Agent: A second, as we saw, and then we saw that, you
EndUser: How many of these different pieces we saw?
EndUser: Do you see typically our hands on end users that have been trained in those departments versus operations or some more senior level sales force knowledgeable folks are involved?
Agent: Where does it kind You know, So generally how I see Data Cloud being used is a lot of that upfront.
EndUser: Of?
EndUser: Great. Yeah.
Agent: The canonical model is owned by a data team, the [ORG-1] team. So I'm going to do a little bit more technical.
EndUser: We
Agent: Want this tool's purpose built for a less technical user, whether that's a marketer, a [ORG-5], a [ORG-5] manager, maybe who's setting up some of these nurture paths themselves to be able to come in here and create their own segments and then activate them.
Agent: So I would say that [DATE-9] of it. Definitely a little bit more of someone with some data knowledge should own it.
Agent: It's purposely designed so that the insights that we're bringing to [PRODUCT-3] and the segments that we're creating are business user-friendly. As far as Marketing cloud, I want to be clear, the tool is called [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: The reason we're showing it here is it's really purpose-built to be a customer communication engine. So a tool like [ORG-9] is built for B2B to [PERSON-16]. Our tool, Pardot, is our Competitor to that.
Agent: It's built for B2B to [PERSON-16], and that's how the data model is structured.
Agent: Our tool called [PRODUCT-6] is a little bit more like broad customer communications and most of our customers, no, I don't want to say most, probably half our customers use it for outside of traditional Marketing use cases.
Agent: This would be something [PERSON-1] where I would think you would want to empower again a [ORG-5], a [ORG-5] manager, if the Marketing team wanted to use this, the Marketing team to come in here and create some of their own journey paths and their own [PRODUCT-7] paths because it is a tool that's designed to be used by less technical user.
Agent: But these are all things that as we move, if this is something we want to move forward with, as we get into implementation, these are the things we can really closely define.
Agent: Who owns what, who's working and what, what three use Cases do we want to action off in [DATE-18]?
Agent: Those are all that will help you define. Hopefully, that's helpful as a broad overview of [DATE-9] of Data Cloud, generally more technical, everything else a less technical user can use.
EndUser: That means it really well actually.
EndUser: And I definitely were seeing it kind of the same way because ourselves, meaning when I say ourselves, I'm talking about the operations team, specifically around the [ORG-1] net suite, charge be kind of arena.
EndUser: But then you've got [ORG-51], which is the analytic side.
Agent: And there is a
EndUser: Lot of collaboration happening just out of necessity between what I call my team and [ORG-51], right?
EndUser: Or [PERSON-3]'s team to speak.
Agent: And [ORG-51], so
EndUser: And finding the way two for both of us to collaborate in the front end part of this process would be really level us up for empowering the organization.
EndUser: And that's the thing that I feel like this has really resonated with me for.
Agent: Yeah, it's a period. As we think about it, and like maybe this is a little too broad, This can be your central definition of who the customer is.
Agent: And so then every interaction, automation, activation, you want to make off of that customer definition kind of starts here.
Agent: And so instead of having to go to the warehouse, find specific data, go to whatever, you have it here, you can start from that. So appreciate that feedback, thank you very much.
EndUser: [PERSON-1]. Yeah, no,
Agent: And I'll
Agent: Just add to that as well. I actually have multiple customers in my territory that have [ORG-9] and then have [PRODUCT-6] side by side. They use [ORG-9] for their demand-gen lead nurture in nurturing to conversion or revenue.
Agent: And then they use [PRODUCT-6] for like product announcements, product feature updates, windows, like actual, because it's just much more versatile across like post sale, being able to ingest different data sources and personalized customer experiences.
Agent: Maintenance
Agent: So we see that with Pardite, we see some customers have.
Agent: Part out in Market and Cloud together as [PERSON-13] l for that very specific reason So again, just something to kind of keep in mind Market and Cloud is definitely much more experienced platform not so much just like a typical Marketing like, hey, how do we drive awareness and sales ?
Agent: As far as next steps, I know that we showed you a lot. We'll send you the presentation. We'll also send you the Recording of this so you can internalize that. And then I'll also post it.
Agent: Do you want me to post it into our external [ORG-35] group, [PERSON-3], our channel?
EndUser: Yeah, you I definitely plan to share could.
Agent: Ok, it out with several. Perfect. So I'll do that as well.
Agent: And then what we can do [PERSON-3] is I'll just [ORG-35] and we can regroup and like really from our side like an [PRODUCT-8] would be like also looking at what would it take to implement something like a Data Cloud and so getting a partner involved and starting talking about what does that look like?
Agent: What's the level of effort there?
Agent: What are their operational?
Agent: Once the planes in the air?
Agent: What does that look like on your side to keep it, you know, to keep it operationally healthy and effective?
Agent: So we can start kind of diving into that. Umm m The other thing we have too, and [PERSON-3], thank you, I know that you have filled out our business value input sheet.
Agent: So when we pivot to pricing, like we'll go through like a very specific ROI exercise with you all. And then we can share pricing of what the [ORG-1] [DATE-16] pricing for the actual software.
Agent: It looks like plus that one time Implementation from a partner based off some of the use Cases and where we want to start with you all. So we'll do all that.
Agent: Like kind of those are next steps down the road, but definitely internalize this and less of there's anything specific that you need to see.
Agent: [PERSON-3], I can kind of line on those next step s and when those should happen .
EndUser: Yeah, absolutely. Really appreciate this. Pretty amazing. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, you guys, you know, carbout the time to spend with us [DATE-1] because it was very insightful.
EndUser: Super thankful that
EndUser: Yeah, fantastic. Glad you liked it. Thanks,
Agent: [PERSON-6]. Appreciate it. Yeah,
Agent: [PERSON-18]. And feel free to ping me, you know, and as you circulate it, like we have the cycrib. I want people to send me questions.
Agent: So like, if you known, if you all have questions as you think, in just I'm here to thank you.
EndUser: Like happy
EndUser: Help. So All right, take care. Have a good
Agent: One.
EndUser: Thank you. Thanks all.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:
- ""How do we go and make this tangible to taste point, right?""
- ""So like, how do we keep your customers engaged? Do we keep them healthy? Do we keep them in a place where they rene w and they stay with you as an organization?""
- ""And then as we think about the data component and how that actually would impact some of these other areas as well down the road.""
- ""So as we think about it, we unify all these metrics from these sources. And then we provide, at least in the first phase, really two main use cases, which I've really touched on.""
- ""And then this is, I think y'all generally get the concept by this point, but as I was thinking about all the sources that we might use in this single definition of who county consultant is, Marketing data, website data, inclusive of [ORG-4], product data certainly living in [GPE-1] and BigQuery, [ORG-1] data, service cloud, cases, things like that.""

These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs and goals, and how the seller's product could potentially address them.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","The transcript suggests that the customer found the seller's product to be a good fit for their needs. They expressed interest in the product's capabilities, particularly its potential to help them unify data from various sources and create insights for retention-oriented messaging. The customer also appreciated the visualizations and use cases presented during the demo. However, they did have some technical questions about the product's functionality, which the seller was able to answer satisfactorily. Overall, the customer's tone and questions indicate that they are positively disposed towards the product and see its potential value for their organization.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer: The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and presenting the seller's product accordingly. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. When discussing the data cloud application, the sales rep mentioned that it can ingest data from various sources, including Snowflake, Marketing Cloud, and Product 3. The sales rep could have asked the customer about their current data sources and how they would like to integrate them with the data cloud application.
2. The sales rep mentioned that the data cloud application can create calculated insights, such as a number of logins in a certain time period. The sales rep could have asked the customer about the specific insights they would like to create and how they would like to use them.
3. The sales rep mentioned that the data cloud application can enrich the contact record with data from various sources. The sales rep could have asked the customer about the specific data they would like to enrich the contact record with and how they would like to use it.
4. The sales rep mentioned that the data cloud application can trigger tasks and create cases based on certain conditions. The sales rep could have asked the customer about the specific conditions they would like to trigger tasks and create cases for and how they would like to use them.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs, but could have spent more time asking specific questions to better understand how the customer would like to use the data cloud application.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the ability of the seller's product to unify data from various sources and create a single customer profile, which they referred to as the 'golden record'. They also appreciated the potential for real-time reactions to customer signals, such as someone viewing a cancellation page on their website, and the ability to trigger specific actions based on those signals. Additionally, the customer was interested in the potential for standardization of sales activities and tasks, as well as the ability to create more proactive retention messaging.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the correct decision maker was on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The seller mentions discussing implementation and pricing with the customer, but it is not clear if this was agreed upon or if it was simply mentioned as a possibility.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear evidence of the customer's specific concerns about the seller's product. The customer asked some technical questions about the product's features and capabilities, but did not express any significant concerns."
video_19777_167_6qr3y000000g3HnAAI,"Agent: Great,
Agent: Great to meet everyone. My name is [PERSON-1]. I'm also a [ORG-1] here at [ORG-2] specializing in our Marketing and data solutions products.
Agent: And then as [PERSON-2] mentioned, wanted to provide a little background sort of why and how, while we invested in our data solutions products, data cloud, just give you some of that context. So next slide.
Agent: So we're [ORG-2], [ORG-2], we're a customer-focused company and we want to help you deliver customer success. And we recognize that one of the key challenges to delivering customer success is disconnected data.
Agent: You, like other Enterprise companies, have an incredibly rich and vast resource of data that's being collected every day. But it's difficult to access it and unlock it because it's siloed on these separate islands. Next slide.
Agent: And but connecting that data so there are all these islands and you want to connect it, but connecting it is difficult.
Agent: The average company [DATE-1] has hundreds even thousands of different applications being used in each of these applications has different types of data whether that's engagement data from your digital properties on your website mobile apps, physical products your vehicles machine learning data [PRODUCT-1] data.
Agent: And to solve this, companies are building ad hoc integrations to connect these different applications and point-to-point integrations in order to access this data, but it's difficult to do this at scale. Next slide.
Agent: And so this is the problem that we've focused on here at [ORG-2] at solving for our customers. And for examples of customers who are solving it, they're achieving measurable business impact.
Agent: And so it's a couple of examples of our customers here. Enter, increase the ROI Marketing campaigns by 17 times. Formula One has increased their fan base three times by converting engagements into revenue. and general mills.
Agent: They've increased their known users by [PERCENT-1] by creating a single source of truth. So, sort of set this background, identify the problem of disconnected data.
Agent: You have this resource, but connecting it is difficult at scale, but it's important because it's going to unlock
Agent: Business value and deliver customer success. So, now I'm going to hand it off to [PERSON-3], who's going to dive into exactly how we do I'm [PERSON-4]. I am a technical architect on the [ORG-3] team.
Agent: I also have a couple of folks from my team on the call as well who you may hear from if we get into some Q&A. So [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6].
Agent: I just want to make a quick note that this is an education session and I know I'm up at the front speaking but if you have any questions feel free to raise your hand.
Agent: I get a little self-conscious like just being the center of attention, talking for however many slides I've got. So anyhow, you can see here [DATE-2] of Innovation at Salesforce.
Agent: We've been on this mission to deliver, of course, the single source of truth for our customers, businesses for [DATE-3]. [DATE-4] [DATE-5]. I think that's [DATE-2] now. And it's been a long road, as you can see.
Agent: And over time, the technology landscape has evolved dramatically. And what I really want to emphasize here is that, [ORG-3] has been a long time coming.
Agent: Our customers have been manually stitching together, all of their complex and disparate systems to get value from all these different tools. Some of these tools that you can see here on this slide.
Agent: And it's been a challenge, but [ORG-3] is really here to help simplify and solve that challenge to democratize essentially that complex process so that all of our customers can more quickly realize the value of all this data and all these different tools.
Agent: The value of the data and the form of insights and form of actions and intelligent automations for all of those [PRODUCT-1] big data use cases.
Agent: So on the next slide I'm going to walk through how all of this works.
Agent: And there's a lot here so In order to get this, to stitch all of this data together and as seamlessly as possible and to get the value over on the right side, we start on the left by obviously bringing in data, connecting to data, all of your relevant data at hyperscale.
Agent: And we do this with our extensive library of out of the box connectors native to [ORG-3] and we also in partnership of our [ORG-4] platform.
Agent: So Data Cloud is going to offer you that flexibility to bring in data, either batch in a schedule, if that's what's needed or in streaming as the data is updated.
Agent: And that data can be ingested, so brought into data cloud, or it can stay where it is. I think [PERSON-2] mentioned zero [ORG-5].
Agent: We also call this bring your own lake where you can securely share data bi-directionally between [ORG-2] and your external data lakes and warehouses. I'm going to talk a little bit more about that in [TIME-1].
Agent: But once that data's been ingested, now we need to transform it. And we can do that with either clicks or Code right within [LOC-1] in our drag and drop or code-based interface.
Agent: And after that, we've got always the challenge of when you've got data coming in from different systems, it comes in a variety of different formats.
Agent: And so Data Cloud harmonizes all of this data, no matter what the format is, into a common data model.
Agent: And just like on the [ORG-2] platform, where we have the out of the box [ORG-2] data model, we also have a standard data model and [ORG-3] that you can use, or you can create your own custom data model to fit your data and your business needs.
Agent: Not to gather these, all these data models create a customer profile. This is your single source of truth at every customer or really any of your data where you want that [QUANTITY-1].
Agent: This is what we're all going for when we want that unified 400 view.
Agent: But the real power is over on the right where once you have all of that data unified and harmonized in data cloud, now you can get value out of it in the form of insights and actions.
Agent: We have to do a calculated insights. through segmentation, through automation, through AI-triggered automations, grounded [ORG-6] and a lot more.
Agent: On the next slide, I'm gonna talk about Oh, and maybe real quick, [PERSON-7], I'll just throw in.
Agent: So, you know, we wanted to make sure and invite some members of the [ORG-7] team across the greater region because we know that you're working on some similar projects, as well as some different projects, right?
Agent: [PERSON-8], I know for you, when you're probably talking about like how you act, you know, it's a lot about your ability to communicate and market to customers. I know that you've been a big part of the commerce process.
Agent: Project, right?
Agent: Owning that project.
Agent: So how are you being able to use data for both [ORG-8] e and Marketing activities, but also able to see all of those interactions and kind o f one holistic customer profile ?
Agent: And [PERSON-9], for you, it's probably more of what's going on right now around dealer 400 and analytics and how do you get that complete view of your dealers.
Agent: So we wanted to bring this to you because we thought that certainly there's some common challenges in trying to bring your data together and then how do you act on that across different types of engagements.
Agent: Yeah, and I think [PERSON-2], we have on the agenda, some also to use cases as well, where we can drill down into them.
Agent: Talk about some of those
Agent: Yeah, this is very generic, just giving you an overview of how [ORG-3] works and what all of some of the capabilities are.
EndUser: And so, hey, since [PERSON-2] brought it up, I'm just going to say hello. I apologize for being late, [PERSON-9], snap from [ORG-7]. One quick question since I did start late.
EndUser: Could I ask who all is on this call?
EndUser: Is this just [ORG-2] and [ORG-7] or are there other participants as well?
Agent: It's just Okay.
EndUser: [ORG-2] and [ORG-7] case. Oh, hey, [PERSON-10].
Agent: All right. Thank
EndUser: You. Yeah. I thought so, but before I started asking questions, I need to know who's hearing Safe space.
Agent: A bunch of detailed them.
EndUser: There is no such thing. So as we go through this and thank you, [PERSON-7], it's a pleasure meeting. I appreciate you taking the time to go over this stuff.
EndUser: One of my, I guess my focus in this particular thing, if I can be selfish for just one second is understanding capabilities is wonderful. I'm quite certain that sales force [ORG-3] is is.
EndUser: In the top tier of capabilities, you know, when compared to a lot of other things.
EndUser: Most of the questions is, okay, so you said on the last slide, you can either [ORG-3] or you can use it, you know, in your own data sales force or, or sales force, snowflake or whatever.
Agent: Bring your data into our
EndUser: But what are the, are we going to talk about best practices or how do you get down to a decision about how much of Data Cloud to incorporate and things like that. And that part of this particular thing,
Agent: Or we just talking about sort of general, here the different functions that our platform is capable of. Yeah, let me chime in real quickly [PERSON-9].
Agent: So this is more of a of an education 116 high level because The reality of it is to [PERSON-2]'s point there's several projects across [LOC-2] and a lot of questions around [ORG-9] and how we're going to manage the data across various projects have come up Both in [GPE-1] and literally [DATE-6] when I was in [GPE-2] and so while The goal [DATE-1] originally was to really talk about an Implementation of Data Cloud and how that could be germane to [ORG-7] pay dealer 172 loyalty right there's about three or four key projects in [GPE-3] .
Agent: There were just way too many questions across the region that I felt like we needed to level set and give a lot of people from [LOC-2].
Agent: We've got representation from [GPE-1] and [GPE-2] on a call just to give everyone an overview of what it is and what it does. And then we go into, yeah. So.
EndUser: You know, wonderful. So I will write mine down,
Agent: But I won't bombard you with
Agent: A bunch of, you know, this this or this or that type of question. So, yeah, no worries. I do have a one or two sit-and-answer to that.
Agent: So [PERSON-2], can we go back to just one?
Agent: So yeah, if you think about in this question, we get all the time from customers.
Agent: What data do I put in?
Agent: How do I configure data cloud?
Agent: If you look at the right on that ACT column and you look at all of the insights and the actions, the [ORG-6], all the way you're going to get value out of your data, Once you decide what that is, then you go to the left and then that informs what data do I bring in?
Agent: Do I use zero [ORG-5], bring your own lake or do I ingest it?
Agent: Do I do batch or do I do streaming?
Agent: How do I transform it?
EndUser: Once you know what your answer is to the right, then you can start moving over to the left and
Agent: Figure out how to develop your solution. Hopefully that makes sense. That's where it goes. Thank you.
Agent: So we talked a little bit about bring your own lake. We want to highlight the vision of [ORG-3] is really to be this open and extensible platform.
Agent: We know it sales force that majority of our customers have their own data warehouses, data lakes, even [ORG-6] models that have already been built and other tools.
Agent: So if your data exists in these other systems like right now we've got snow, for example, snowflake.
Agent: [ORG-10], and you don't want to necessarily move it into [ORG-3] to realize that value on the right side of the previous screen, then that's okay.
Agent: You can keep your data where it is, and we've enabled the ability to securely and just buy directionally share that data between [ORG-2] and those external data lakes and data warehouses. The same is true for [ORG-6] models.
Agent: So if you've got a a predictive customer churn model that's built in [GPE-4] or [PRODUCT-2] or [ORG-10], and you don't want to rebuild it, you can deploy that in data cloud, or you could use one of our new [PERSON-10] no-co model builders as well.
Agent: So just giving you that flexibility. And over on the right, with the first party advertising, you can extend your audiences to trusted partners like [ORG-12] and [PERSON-12] while enabling those privacy safe insights.
Agent: And then of course, on the bottom right, our app exchange, where we have all of our key partnerships with [ORG-18] to discover those new use cases and best-in-class partner apps and experts.
Agent: The next few slides are more deep dives, slightly deep dives into how [ORG-3] works. So from that previous pipeline, so if anyone has any high level questions, feel free to let me know.
Agent: But I'm just going to walk through these.
Agent: So connecting to the data, just emphasizing, again, we've got the ability to use streaming or batch data ingestion, depending on, again, what your use cases and what your needs are using our out-of-the-box connectors that we have.
Agent: We want to deep dive into connectors. We can do that maybe at a later time. The ability to bring your own data lake that's called it also called zero [ORG-5].
Agent: So to securely access that real-time data and remove any kind of latency that would occur in migrating data over. Also, the ability to transform that data, harmonize that data right within [ORG-3] as well.
Agent: Again, once we've connected with them, we can harmonize. This is where [ORG-2] has this canonical data model already of how we kind of best practice for our [ORG-2] data.
Agent: We'll give you that data model out of the box or just or you can customize and build your own data model or you take a hybrid approach as well. Drag and drop data mapping.
Agent: So again, that... intuitive Salesforce UI to streamline the process if you need to make any customizations and then data spaces which I didn't highlight on the previous slide but that's our layer of governance so if you need to segment your data by By region or department, along with your metadata and processes, that's also capable through a feature called data spaces as well.
Agent: Just a lot to cover in [TIME-2] or less call. So we've got that data model. We want to unify that data to create that 400 degree view of an individual person or accounts.
Agent: And that's what we're doing with a feature called [ORG-14], where you can match and reconcile that data at the individual or account level to create that 400 unified view.
Agent: And then once you've got that unified view of people or accounts, then you can use that unified profile to. to gain additional insights, to take action on, to create, predict, drag predictions off of as well.
Agent: And then finally, my favorite part, when we get over to the right side of our data pipeline, which is where we get the action and insights, starting off with analyze and predict.
Agent: So whether you have [PRODUCT-1] analytics or [GPE-5] or use any other [ORG-6] BI tool of your choice, You can visualize and understand that data directly from [ORG-3] with CRM Analytics and [GPE-5], I should note, those are direct data queries.
Agent: So you are getting very quick insights, accelerated queries from [ORG-3] as well. And I think I highlighted again on that [ORG-16] slide,
Agent: The ability to Bring Your Own Model or to build any [ORG-6] model to gain additional insights.
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-7], can you do me a favor?
Agent: Can you go back to the previous slide?
Agent: And I have a question for [GPE-1], [GPE-6], [GPE-2]. So [PERSON-8], I'll ask you first. [DATE-7], when we talk about unifying a customer profile in [GPE-1], do you have
EndUser: A centralized customer, snowflake environment up and running right now in [GPE-1]?
EndUser: Yes, we have CBM, which is our customer database, where [TIME-3] I'm going to say it's pretty complete, but there are certain areas of the business that are still not plugged in.
EndUser: Feeding that database, but we do have the Nissan 1ID. So there's the unique customer number per every customer in the database and service, some after sales data, and everything that happens
Agent: Basically on the sales and finance side flows into that space [DATE-1]. So I guess long winded answer to say yes. That's awesome. OK, same question for [PERSON-18] in the [GPE-6].
Speaker 10: So I'm going to actually
Agent: [PERSON-14] that to [PERSON-16]. So you're asking to be versus our current. Yeah, I guess I know. I know [PERSON-18] has been working on a Customer400 right in the [GPE-6]. And so that that is not ready just yet.
Speaker 12: Correct. Okay, and what's the
Agent: What's the [ORG-18] on it being completed?
Agent: So 14
EndUser: [DATE-8] from [DATE-9].
EndUser: Okay, okay.
Speaker 10: Hold on [PERSON-18], what's your level of confidence in that answer?
Speaker 10: Pretty damn confident.
Speaker 8: Months?
Speaker 10: Well, so it's going to be in different phases or releases, but the data
EndUser: Will be available in Snowflake
Agent: Based on the requirements that are needed by face. So, yeah.
Agent: Okay, I thought it was sooner. Okay. Okay. And then I'll ask then [GPE-2], [PERSON-14], I'm going to assume you have two different databases, one for NRFM and one for [ORG-7], [GPE-2].
Agent: But from from what we're trying to do with the owners portal
EndUser: Consolidated owners portal in [GPE-2], where will you be pulling the customer data in [GPE-2]?
EndUser: You're able to have one centralized database with all the information for our customers, but that platform is going to be migrated to AWS following the same strategy that's on the running [DATE-1].
EndUser: I mean, we're going to move our central database into [GPE-4] and moving
Agent: In all the applications that we have [DATE-1] connected. But that's a product that is in cloud is right now. And is that being
EndUser: Done sequentially with the [GPE-6]?
EndUser: Or are you gonna have to wait [DATE-10] more to get that data in [GPE-2]?
EndUser: I would say in that way, we are following the same strategy in places.
Agent: But we have our
Speaker 9: Own time in to run that. Okay. [PERSON-10], I also made mistakes. Sorry to clarify.
Agent: This is,
Speaker 8: They asked was about customer data, correct?
Speaker 9: Correct. So my bad. I was speaking on the project effort. So from the customer perspective for [ORG-14], it is my understanding that all that data will be in pride sometime in [DATE-10].
Speaker 10: I do not have a date of what that is.
Agent: I'm just going to get it into [DATE-10], but that's my understanding. Oh, that's great news.
EndUser: Okay, so
Speaker 10: That's that is much, much faster than 17. Now I am not over that project. However, that's what I
Agent: Understand my
EndUser: Last update was from like [DATE-12]. Okay.
Agent: Now that's
EndUser: Roughly close, [PERSON-17]. I'd say end of March, you know, if we need to a specific date
Agent: Sometime then, but it's it's closer than [DATE-10] for sure. Okay, okay, awesome. Okay, that's great. That's wonderful news to hear. All right, so [PERSON-3], take it away.
Speaker 10: Sorry, I needed to ask where everyone is at.
Speaker 9: Yeah, so can you leave the feel one layer for that identity resolution, [PERSON-3], like, you know, meaning like, you know, when you say that, right?
Speaker 10: What kind of data sets sales force uses for that identity resolution?
Speaker 10: Set proprietary or do they use some [ORG-17] data or like, you know, some address.
Agent: Post to data. Yeah. So, I'm talking about what is the logic that's used
Speaker 10: To help create that unified profile?
Agent: Right, yeah, but I see. So we do have some out of the box. It's rule based logic. And we do have some out of the box matching rules that come with data cloud.
Agent: But customers are able to customize with their own logic as well, depending on what data that they have.
Speaker 9: So it's a blend. It's a blend. So. So again, you have a set of data that you provide as part of this cloud platform that can be leveraged for identity resolution for any domain per se.
Agent: Yeah, for the idea with identity resolution is that we're unifying either people essentially.
Speaker 9: Or accounts
Agent: Can it be used to unify something else?
Speaker 10: Yes, but it just wasn't necessarily built for that. Okay. Excellency.
Agent: It calls for customization. Yeah. The whole. Yeah. And the idea is we're unifying that 400 customer view, whether that customer is a person or
Speaker 9: A business. Yeah. Thank you.
Agent: So I think the next one we talked about analytics, lots of flexibility there, and then the ability to act on that data to essentially make your [PRODUCT-1] or your other tool intelligent, to add that layer of intelligence and data-driven decision-making to all of those actions.
Agent: So whether that is what we have, what we call data enrichment, so taking the data that's in data cloud, and materializing it or virtualizing it, so either moving it over to [ORG-2] or making it just visible in [ORG-2] directly on those record pages to give additional insights to those users, or to incorporate any of that data, whether that is just fields and regular data or AI-driven powered prediction inferences or any other data, incorporate that into [ORG-2] flows.
Agent: To add that additional layer of intelligence there to automate sales force based off of data or changes in data in data cloud. And then we have segmentation capabilities to query and split data into segments of groups.
Agent: Based on different attributes and characteristics.
Agent: Anyone else on my team that am I missing out any other actions?
Agent: I feel like every day we have a new feature that comes out with different capabilities.
Agent: Well, so I wanna chime in, especially [PERSON-8].
Agent: Well, anyone from, I don't know if anyone from the [ORG-17] team is on the call, but [PERSON-8], you know, [GPE-1] is using [PRODUCT-3] right?
EndUser: Extensively,
Agent: And so part of what you can do in [LOC-1] is as [PERSON-7] indicated, creating segments.
Agent: So let's just take, you know, you guys want to run a segment of a group of customers who have purchased a car, but hasn't purchased extended warranty.
Agent: It's just the same, right?
Agent: And you have a campaign that you want to go ahead and send an email for those customers in that segment. The segmentation part would be done in [LOC-1]. The X-ray.
Agent: Execution of the email or text would be done through through Marketing cloud.
EndUser: A journey that make sense ?
Agent: Does
EndUser: Yeah, okay. And then [PERSON-10] on that or [PERSON-7].
EndUser: So those Data Cloud do basically aggregation of data that exists between Service Cloud and Sales Cloud and then that pushes audiences into [PRODUCT-3] or like is the Integration between those two right service
Agent: And sales. And other.
Agent: Yeah, every yeah, think of it as you could pull in data around sales, around service, commerce and level
EndUser: Engagement data.
Agent: Third party, you know, you're talking the data that you've gotten snowflake. So all of that. Pull together. And.
Agent: Unified, and then you could act on it, which an act could be creating a segmentation you know, launches a customer into a journey.
EndUser: That then auto,
EndUser: Okay. Um, I have a subsequent question on Marketing cloud, but I can I can ask that in a separate forum or call. Um, the one that I wanted to.
EndUser: So I've been hearing a lot of different pitches on [GPE-7] in particular. And, and, and there was a comment made in one of the meetings that we had that [ORG-3] is part [GPE-7], but not at full [GPE-7].
EndUser: Um, and I'm not sure that meant.
Agent: Exactly what
EndUser: Um, but I guess I try I'm trying to educate myself. more as to what are maybe the limitations that [GPE-7] could have or sorry that Data Cloud could hav e if we looked at it .
EndUser: As a [GPE-7] as well beyond just data aggregation platform.
Agent: I would say [PERSON-8] said this is [PERSON-17]. I'm your friendly neighborhood [PRODUCT-3] and working with [ORG-7] and [ORG-17] for I guess about seven years-ish.
EndUser: Solution engineer
Agent: And then dedicated for [DATE-18]. And I would say it's actually kind of the opposite.
EndUser: And
Agent: Data Cloud is a super set. of all of the [GPE-7] functionalities.
Agent: So everything that we had with [GPE-7], giving a little bit of, going back to a little bit of the history of where [ORG-3] came from, we were developing a lot of, customary 400 and that's been a term that we've used and many other reviews.
Agent: We've been developing that for for [DATE-2] with the platform and yet as we move forward we started to think about activation of all of that data and aggregating it all into one place and then a Marketing execution tool which [PRODUCT-3] is, or [ORG-14] is, is not necessarily the best place for that aggregation of all of that data to be.
Agent: So a [GPE-7], kind of the idea of a customer data platform, became this thing that everybody in the industry was talking about, I guess, five, five And so what we did was we took a lot of the work that we we've been doing on that Customer400 what that meant to us .
EndUser: [DATE-14] now, ish.
Agent: And put all of that into the energy behind making that a [GPE-7].
Agent: And so we built that into what became [ORG-2], [ORG-17], and a lot of it was targeted at the very specific Marketing functionalities of aggregating all of the data, whether it came from the service in [LOC-3], whether it came from external sources, different kinds of places, third parties, data from [PRODUCT-3] engagement data [PRODUCT-3] engagement .
Agent: And then being able to segment and activate off of that, that was originally kind of what [GPE-7] did.
Agent: As we have grown that set of functionalities to expand beyond we decided that it had to have its own name, the data cloud, because it kind of encompasses everything we did that [GPE-7] was and added on to that the ability to tap into all of that data for analytics as [PERSON-7] was talking about.
EndUser: That significantly,
Agent: To be able to enhance and enhance rich the customer view within Sales and Service Cloud and hence [PRODUCT-4] as well . in
Agent: Addition to being able to activate segments into [ORG-12] and the meta platforms. So one window to answer to your question, [ORG-3] is actually a superset of what [GPE-7] was and adds
Agent: In a tremendous amount of extensible functionality that builds and enhances. everything that we do at [ORG-2]. As a. And this is [PERSON-17] over technical architects for data cloud.
Agent: I just added in there to what [PERSON-14] was saying is that being a super set. Many of the underlying platform capabilities that were required to be able to create a wonderful [GPE-7].
Agent: Yes, a full [GPE-7] even looking against competitive [GPE-7] solutions. It requires great data platform capabilities.
Agent: So really over [DATE-16], what's happened is we have exposed and greatly expanded upon the rich data management capabilities that were part of [LOC-1].
Agent: And also really embrace that sort of open interface out through the bringing your own leg and [WORK_OF_ART-1] and data federation capabilities.
Speaker 10: So it makes it more than just a classical [GPE-7]. But it has all the features of a classical [GPE-7] plus. OK, awesome. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. So you're saying you're a what you call cloud data platform.
Speaker 9: And you provide, you take care of the storage cost and the compute cost and algorithms cost and all that in one solution.
Speaker 14: So at the time, the customization is based off of a model which is your perceived and tested for [DATE-18]. And that's what you already call embark on or enhance on.
Agent: So I mean, is there a slide or something like that, like, you know, which will show the like, you know, the textually, like what, what a Data Cloud is. We left out some of those detailed slides, [PERSON-7].
Agent: I don't know if you have an answer or a favor, but we did leave some of those out of this specifically.
Speaker 12: But the data,
Agent: You know, the data platform or the data management features. Yes, we provide as [PERSON-7] talked about, you know, what we might call the Customer 400 Data model.
Agent: And that includes some kind of, you know, build in understanding of the source data from [ORG-17] and Sales Cloud and then transformations to get it into that customer 400. But the capabilities that are there, you know,
Speaker 10: Enable transformation queries to be executed, persisting other data objects and, you know, creating different semantic definitions. Thanks for watching ! So, so essentially you're shipping the data from aid into your cloud and then that's where the magic happens.
Speaker 9: Is that how we have to perceive this?
Agent: Yes, but also with that those open interfaces that I talked about
Speaker 9: To be able to make use of things that have already been done, you know outside of the system as well Is there a possibility that you push down the model to some other compute like you know Or something like
Agent: That like you know, so where we are already vested like we have a snowflake We are AWS all these Yeah, we we tie in directly to [PRODUCT-5] on [GPE-4].
Agent: So we can make use of models that you have already created in [PRODUCT-5] also vertex in in [ORG-30] in [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: And we're working right now with Databricks to be able to pull in the native Databricks models. Yeah, so, [PERSON-17], the reality of it is that each region has a different set of projects and or requirements.
Agent: So, for example, in the [GPE-6], right, we've got a dealer 214 project going where a lot of the data is in snowflake.
Agent: And so the big question is, do we bring in data from snowflake for that project?
Agent: If it could be done here, then the answer is no.
Agent: You wouldn't bring in all the data from snowflake into that, right?
Agent: We've got [PERSON-8] up in [GPE-1] who is using [ORG-2] e-commerce, [ORG-2] sales, [ORG-2] customer service, [ORG-2] Marketing cloud. So she's got a lot her data already in [ORG-2].
Agent: And then [PERSON-8]'s needs in [GPE-1] are I've got all this data. I've got all this customer data. Now I want to act. already have Marketing Cloud I've been using [PRODUCT-3] for [DATE-14] .
Agent: Doing all these Marketing campaigns. But now I want to segment, I want to clean my data, I want to segment. And so Data Cloud would be used for [PERSON-8] or in [GPE-1] in this way.
Agent: Very different than what we're going to try to use it in the [GPE-6] and probably very different in [GPE-2] with their owners portal.
Agent: I was just trying to get as many people from [LOC-2] on one call to try to level set of what [ORG-3] is.
Agent: Does that help?
Agent: Thank you. Okay, yeah,
Agent: No problem. All right, [PERSON-7], we have [TIME-4] left before we have some key people leave.
Agent: Yeah, so let me just breeze through this Data Cloud is going to be integral is integral in powering our you know any [ORG-6] automation whether that's predictive or generative [ORG-6] everything's tightly integrated we know [ORG-6] needs big data [ORG-3] handles big data and those integrations I'm going to leave it at that because I know we really wanted to talk next about some some additional use cases to get everyone's brain thinking about how Data Cloud fits in with [ORG-7],
Agent: Unless there are questions on this. And if not, I think [PERSON-14] is. I believe so. We go to the first story [PERSON-2]. So,
Agent: Formula one, I think everybody on the call probably knows what Formula one is and with the drive to survive the [ORG-29] series the popularity is exploded globally.
Agent: But why do we why do we even bring this one up it's because the because of the concept of the connected fan. They have 514 million fans globally. It's constantly expanding.
Agent: Their television audience is over a billion and a half, a billion and a half people. of those will never attend a race.
Agent: So how do they connect with the fans?
Agent: It's almost all digital. And all of that is being powered by what they're doing with [ORG-3]. They use [ORG-3]. They use [PRODUCT-3]. They use [ORG-21].
Agent: All of those are basically allowing them to engage with the fans, where, when, and how each fan really wants to, and how they want to consume content, whether it's on their mobile phone, through the Formula One apps, whether it's through watching on TV and on the web , their fan activations across the globe
Agent: , stores , All of those things are things they're pulling all of that together using all of those different parts of parts of [ORG-2] platforms to put everything together so that no matter where those fans are both globally, whatever language they speak, whatever method they're using to consume the [PRODUCT-6] that Formula One can meet them where they are.
Agent: Next slide.
Agent: [ORG-21] is, [ORG-21]'s doing a lot of different things with [ORG-3] and kind of similar to the place that I think every, almost every company is certainly the automotive industry. They're looking to become much more customer centric.
Agent: And in the auto industry, as in many industries, we've been very product focused. But as you're trying to get a customer 400, they're trying to do the same kind of thing.
Agent: And what that means for them and for everybody is much more personalized experiences at every touch point right across the entire ownership lifecycle. They are using [ORG-3] to unify customer data that includes.
Agent: Let's see, sales, service, demographic telematics information from the vehicles engagement information from Marketing systems from their websites and they're taking all of that and activating [ORG-21] not just their digital but also their non-digital communications And this is kind of where we're really taking [ORG-3] beyond just those Marketing use cases, right They're of course using it to power their Marketing communications and we talk about they've been able to [ORG-29] their customer journeys by [PERCENT-2] so getting rid of a lot of manual steps is what we mean by that they've been able to ta ke just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of email templates and reduce the complexity of those by [PERCENT-3] by using by using the platform by doing the segmentation by then activating them into those journeys with much more dynamic personalized templates across but not just across email but SMS and app communications But they also take that information and I'm going to highlight the idea that they do this with telematics as well, is that they're powering the Customer 400 in the [ORG-37] sales and service experience for their service teams so that they can see what's happening with the vehicles.
Agent: So it's not just being activated into Marketing journeys, but it's being activated into every aspect of their customer lifecycle. Let's move on to the next customer story.
Agent: [PERSON-17] is their infotainment, telematics service that's available in many of [ORG-37]'s vehicles.
Agent: They launched this project with [ORG-37] in [GPE-8] with the idea, and they did this, I think, I want to say it was [DATE-17], we're in [DATE-5].
Agent: So [DATE-17] now, to basically take the telematics and app information and to use them both to understand their customers better, but in conjunction with what's happening in the vehicles.
Agent: They're using it to build their more personalized offers, promotions, then those are all integrated to their apps. That's the [ORG-34] app, but also the in-vehicle display, and other channels, so email and SMS.
Agent: Very importantly, they're also using [GPE-5].
Agent: Tap into all of that data So [GPE-5] has native ability to tap into the Data Cloud data So now the [GPE-5], they're able to use [PERSON-30] u and t o really get a deep, deep understanding of those customer behaviors, but not just the customer behaviors that customers are telling you, but what the car is telling you.
Agent: So they're looking at things like driving range by [DATE-17], by country. They're looking at how people are using the remote capability features, again, by country in the error codes and other driving patterns.
Agent: They're really not only using that for sharing. and sending Marketing campaigns, but they're also using it for their own analytics . and getting tremendous customer insights.
Agent: And one of the things, an example of kind of what they're doing with all of that is they've... they piloted a program that when I say pilot they deployed in production but piling it in [GPE-8] was to say for example if if somebody's taking a trip into [GPE-9] and they're from the suburbs maybe as they're taking the trip into [GPE-9] work with their partners he is he is partners who might have parking it might be a to offer parking solutions within [GPE-9].
Agent: So it's not just within the [ORG-21] [PRODUCT-7] [PRODUCT-8] but also with their partners. So thinking about [ORG-7], maybe extending to what's bein g done with plug and charge
Agent: And things like that . Yeah, I think this would be a good.
Agent: [PERSON-8], if you get a chance to go to [ORG-30] [DATE-14], this could be something that maybe we can connect you with a customer and see, lessons learned, you know, on how we did that.
EndUser: You know, how
Agent: I mean, I know we only have, well, we have [TIME-5] left, [PERSON-8], before you, before you leave. Maybe we can move forward, the [ORG-7] use cases that we've discussed, but it would be good.
Agent: [PERSON-14], with some of
Agent: As a possible next app, [PERSON-8] and [PERSON-29], is to get more detailed into some of the use cases that
EndUser: You're trying to accomplish in [GPE-1]. Yeah, so [PERSON-10], don't rush on my behalf because I actually have to walk to the other side of the office. So I'll probably should drop in like [TIME-6] or so.
EndUser: So don't rush through it. I can review the balance of the presentation with you in [PERSON-29] at [DATE-17]. I don't appreciate it.
Agent: Want to rush anyone through it. So thank you guys. I No problem.
EndUser: I got a job.
Agent: Awesome.
EndUser: Thank
Agent: You. Thanks, to go back to the one more [PERSON-8].
Agent: All right. I'm going
Agent: And... I think we're good. Yeah.
Agent: I did want to point out the key of [PRODUCT-7] that they are bringing in, as the slide said, they've got [MONEY-1] of events that they are bringing in and
Agent: [PERSON-7] talked about harmonizing and unifying the data. That's the scale that we're talking about. When we're talking about bringing in telematics data, it sounds pretty easy, but it's not just bringing in [MONEY-2] of records.
Agent: It's bringing them in and then harmonizing them and unifying them to the right profile. And that initial, the initial use case that they did where they had that one project, they had a one project that they focused
Agent: On to bring in all of the data, start using it to do
Agent: Some... Marketing activations,
Agent: They built that in [DATE-17] . That's impressive. All right, [PERSON-14]. It's [PERSON-21]Agent: So I'll now take [TIME-7] to share with you some examples or some use cases that we think would potentially be a really good fit.
Agent: For for Data Cloud at [ORG-7] again, this is kind of projects that we're aware of there may be a lot more, but we wanted to share with you.
Agent: So the first is around [ORG-7] pay and I know that the initial focus around [ORG-7] pay is [GPE-6].
Agent: But I I think that there are goals of how can this be expanded, right ?
Agent: Can we leverage some of the lessons learned and some of the technology and be able t o realize new Revenue in other regions as well ?
Agent: With [ORG-7] Pay, there's a lot of, I'll say there's a lot of different deliverable s from being able to sell extended warranties to selling connected services to even thing s like plug-in in charge.
Agent: But one of the things that we saw is we started to get into the details of t he requirements and of the Implementation is that really you needed a tool that was goi ng to be able to aggregate data across a lot of different data sources and do a lot of different things with it.
Agent: So as the first example is segmentation for customer communication s. So if you think of things like telematics data that would be coming off of the [ORG-40] e, In order to know when a customer needs to charge their new area, right?
Agent: So being able to ingest that data in a real-time to be able to be entered into some type of segmentation that could then immediately alert the customer, whether that's a push through things like the My Kneeson app.
Agent: Maybe it's an SMS, maybe it's an email. Of course, you can figure that out.
Agent: What's the right method or maybe it's a combination of methods?
Agent: But the other thing that we saw that I thought was really interesting here is that in many cases around this [ORG-7] pay is This was a really exciting project where a lot of different divisions are working together The problem is that those groups historically have been in different [ORG-2] orgs and using different databases.
Agent: So if you think of things like 400 view of the customer, and [PERSON-8], you know, for you, you're probably in better shape because finance and in CI are all together. In the [GPE-6], you know, it's separate.
Agent: I think in [GPE-2], it's separate.
Agent: And so in this case, [ORG-3] can not only be bringing data in order to be able to send out communications and create segments, but it can also be able to ingest data across different [ORG-2] orgs.
Agent: And that could then be used to create really a more holistic view of the customer, be able to look at all cases across both sales and finance. Again, just as an example.
Agent: And then I think the great thing is is because it's in [ORG-3] already and it's being used for these other use cases you can use it for other scenarios, for example, analytics to be able to create all of that reporting .
Agent: I think another really good example, I'm going to go back to dealer 409 in a minute, is around loyalty. And we know that there's kind of a look at loyalty right now, I think across the entire region.
Agent: But loyalty is interesting because when you think of loyalty, there's a lot of different events, right?
Agent: A lot of different things that a customer could do to earn points. Everything from buying a car, you know, buying or scheduling service to things like being able to, you know, making their payment on time within [PERSON-21].
Agent: So all of those are potential earning opportunities where the customer can earn points. The challenge, of course, is different systems, different data, data that's not necessarily unifying.
Agent: And so in this case, with loyalty, you could bring in data, you know, ingest it, unify it across kind of the entire Enterprise for doing things like being able to recognize points and being able to reward points.
Agent: But then of course also being able to use that for segmentation.
Agent: So if a customer is up to a certain number of points, they've received a badge, they're a certain level, you know, maybe they're gold, that could then enter them into an automatic journey where they could start receiving communications.
Agent: And then the final thing, [PERSON-9], probably more towards you around projects like dealer 300, although I believe that this has already been implemented at least in part in [GPE-1] and [GPE-2], is maybe you're, with dealer 317, you're talking really about the field reps and dealers, this same [ORG-3] solution can be used not only to unify customer data, but it can be used.
Agent: To unify dealer data, right So being able to look across all of that dat a across the dealer, being able to use it for communications being able to use it for all of your analytics which I know is one of the most critical element s to the dealer 335 project is how do you get to the data how do you not replicate the data and then give the users the right analytic s that they need to do their job .
Agent: So again, those are just some use cases that we see right now. We think that there's certainly probably a lot more, but we wanted to share those to give you some ideas.
Speaker 10: [PERSON-2], a few questions.
Speaker 10: So was or customer pay, was there on the previous slide?
Speaker 10: Sorry, I need something.
Agent: Was there a decision yet if Data Cloud was going to be or is going to be used or not?
Agent: Yeah, I can answer that partially. I think that the big question right now is really just, and maybe it kind of goes back to [PERSON-9]'s point, like we need to get into the how.
Agent: To identify where the data is at and get into the details as to how it needs to be connected, how we will unify it, and then what are those journeys that need to get created for the communications.
Speaker 10: So is it actively being worked on yet?
Speaker 10: No. We are scoping that out with [PERSON-21] and his team. Okay, and then for the dealer 374 project, what I understand some of the advantages of using data, [ORG-3] over just snowflake as a connector for.
Speaker 10: [ORG-37] is that ultimate.
Agent: Ultimately, it will offer the users a much faster and better experience.
Speaker 9: Is that correct?
Speaker 10: So can you expand on faster and better experience?
Speaker 8: I just want to make sure I understand what you're thinking.
Speaker 9: So ultimately, we have if we use here, right?
Agent: To use,
Speaker 9: [ORG-34], as the current plan was to go against Snowflake.
Speaker 10: If we were to change that methodology in a sense to get that data populated for those KPIs in a sense, populated into data cloud, is it mind your standing those results or the data that we have?
Speaker 18: The UI to those users would be faster. This one
Agent: Question, I guess. And then also is duplicating the data.
Speaker 18: For basically
Agent: So it's not zero copy anymore, correct?
Agent: So I'm actually going to ask, [PERSON-7], maybe you can help with the details of the zero copy or zero [ORG-5].
Agent: So
Agent: It depends So right now, [ORG-45], you can direct query into Snowflake, or you could ingest that data into [ORG-45] as a data set.
Speaker 10: On the solution.
Agent: Or if you could zero [ORG-5], or bring your own lake, Snowflake to data cloud, and then harmonize that data, direct query it from [ORG-37].
Agent: So kind of either option is like that the same if you're direct querying, if snowflake stays where it is either with [ORG-37],
Agent: It's current architecture or [ORG-37] through Data Cloud because [ORG-37] does a direct query into data cloud. So it's kind of like either way is the same. I think the biggest
Agent: Difference [PERSON-7] would be that unification, right?
Agent: Like if you're bringing
Agent: And unifying dealer data together in this case,
Speaker 12: That would be the significant benefit of data cloud. Yeah, then you would be probably materializing that data in data cloud.
Speaker 10: So one question from my side from the first slides of like, so from the perspective of like, you know, what is CD, what do you call the cloud of [ORG-2], right data cloud.
Speaker 18: So are we saying it's a self-service business intelligence platform or how do we go about this?
Speaker 9: Like, meaning is it a data warehouse?
Speaker 18: Or is it a data mesh
Agent: Or like, you know, What are we trying to say here?
Agent: It is a, we active data lake house.
Speaker 10: Call it an
Agent: It is a data lake house. That's the pattern. Right. That's the data management pattern that it uses. Okay. Underneath we're using.
Agent: We're using open source [PRODUCT-9] iceberg format, which is how we do the data sharing over to Databricks and stuff like others. So data lake house.
Agent: And I'd also say since [ORG-41] is really, it's not a physical or ideological implementation, it's more organization. Data cloud. One of the things that
Speaker 9: Excited me about it and brought me here to [ORG-2] was how well it fits within a [ORG-41] style organization. So I'll organize that. Right, right. So that's what I was going to give you.
Speaker 10: Thanks for clarifying that But from future perspective, like, you know, do we have that self service ability?
Speaker 12: Like, you know, hey, these are the data sets and as an end user, I would have the ability
Agent: To go and do that . putting on the metadata and get my things without IT involvement. I'll ask a stupid question because I'm sure someone else on the sales board.
Agent: [PERSON-29], what utilize analytics?
Speaker 10: Tools do you all primarily it's multiple of them, but tools that you use [DATE-1]?
Agent: I'm sure what are the primary BI
Speaker 10: For us for [GPE-10], [PERSON-37]?
Speaker 10: Yes. Yes. You're using [GPE-5]. Okay. And that's that's the direction
Agent: What we are using. And there are some data science use cases which are very specific to their use cases.
Agent: So yeah. Yeah. So, [PERSON-7], you can probably answer best on how tightly integrated [ORG-3] and [GPE-5] are. Well, yeah, so yeah, lots of tight [PRODUCT-10] and [GPE-5].
Agent: Again, you can options for direct query or batch scheduling that data. But [GPE-5] is there's a lot of governance and controlling the access of data on the [GPE-5] side as well.
Agent: If that's kind of where the question was leading. Also don't want to leave out [ORG-2] operational or native reports and dashboards as well.
Agent: So users, whatever data model that you've created in [ORG-3], you can make that accessible for users to self-serve analytics from the [ORG-2] reports and dashboard side as well.
Agent: So that could be enabled, or you could not make it available. The same thing on the [GPE-5] side. It just depends on.
Agent: What your strategy is.
Agent: And keep in mind, I think, like [PERSON-5] mentioned it, as far as the data architecture, we have the users would query those data model objects, which has the data model, or there's the underlying architecture as well for the data lake objects.
Agent: So there's varying levels of who would query what and at what,
Agent: And when, if that makes sense. Yeah, I think let me just interject. I mean, for the dealer 348, you know, we are proposing [ORG-37].
Agent: Why are we proposing [ORG-37]?
Agent: Because from an end user perspective, I think, you have seen the difference between a seller logging into a tool, that you can easily take action upon versus a seller logging into a one UI and then being sent over to [GPE-5], which is another UI to take an action.
Agent: So for the dealer 379, we're recommending that the end users who are the doms and foams and FSMs, should you see [EVENT-1] because, again, action can be taken from one screen as opposed to moving to [GPE-5] and having to deal with that.
Agent: With regards to, I'm Nope.
Speaker 10: Sorry, was there a question?
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: In regard, and I'm not saying that everyone needs to use [ORG-37] either, right?
Agent: We've talked about the corporate users versus the dealers, et cetera, et cetera. So that's that.
Agent: When it comes to, if you go to [ORG-7] pay, if you go to that slide, You know, the positive about [ORG-3] is if [ORG-7] Pay moves forward utilizing [ORG-3] and if [ORG-40] moves forward with utilizing data cloud.
Agent: You now have [ORG-3] in your technical inventory, if you will. And you can make a decision as to whether multiple projects use [ORG-3] or not.
Agent: Right?
Agent: I mean, that's kind of what the next step in our process was going to be, is to have a workshop to go through these very specific use cases and projects
Speaker 18: To determine if it made sense to leverage data cloud.
Speaker 10: Does that help?
Speaker 12: Yeah, so honestly, I mean, there needs to be some larger strategic plans from. So this is not, you know, my decision. This is the decision that needs to be made from a strategic, [ORG-7] strategic planning.
Speaker 9: This is way above my paycheck of who makes these decisions and such. I don't and I don't know fully who all those people are.
Speaker 10: It's probably some of those people that were in the meetings in [DATE-30], some of [ORG-53], but also to include and [PERSON-37], he is the Yeah, you did officer data officer from the business side.
Speaker 16: [PERSON-37] who is well,
EndUser: So there needs to be these discussions on that higher level. Lastly, and just to help with some clarity there. Sorry, and thank you [PERSON-18]. I appreciate you saying that. Historically speaking, a lot of these.
EndUser: I guess infrastructure decisions have been made. people thought they were making Enterprise wide decisions, but they were really being made at the project level. And somehow we've got to get in front of that.
EndUser: And so [PERSON-37] has past me with trying to help facilitate some of these conversations. I'm certainly aware of the ones, you know, through [PERSON-34], Org.
EndUser: But some of these things still seem to be, some of these conversations still happen. It seemed to be happening. fairly disparate locations throughout the company.
EndUser: So as we work through this, I guess I would just, if you think there's opportunities there, I'm trying to find the right way.
EndUser: We don't have any current paths, right, for making these sort of Enterprise level decisions, unless we go through Enterprise architecture, or something like that. But we're talking about something different here, I think. So anyway, I'm here to help.
EndUser: I don't have all the answers, but I can at least help. Well, lead is extremely interested in these types of conversations, but. And we're still a little short staffed at the leadership level.
EndUser: So I'm trying to spread myself a s then as I can, but trying to help make sure the right people are engaged at the right
Agent: Level from the [PERSON-21]'s name. Right now, I appreciate that [PERSON-9]. And that is one of the reasons why we had this session as opposed to canceling it because I do think we need to go to the next level.
Agent: I mean, the reality of it is to, for let's take [PERSON-8] as an example, right?
Agent: That slide that [PERSON-7] had that had all the sales force tools in the middle of the screen, well, the [GPE-1] [ORG-37] and [ORG-54] is using all of those, right?
Agent: So the question would be, why would... [PERSON-8] go off and have like an epsilon go off and build a custom [GPE-7] or why would anyone for that matter build a customer data platform custom right
Speaker 16: When we have one out of the box so
Agent: [PERSON-8]' s requirements, [GPE-2]'s requirements in the [GPE-6] as I stated in the beginning, we're all different.
Agent: And what we're trying to do is educate the region, right?
Agent: Because we've been challenged by the executive team to be more regional when we are educating, not just to, you know, keys for dealers 450 or dealer So they're blaming you guys.
EndUser: Acts or do you know what I mean?
Speaker 10: Are there giving us an
EndUser: Opportunity to help?
EndUser: How about that?
EndUser: So, I've been here a long time. I completely understand everything that you're saying and with the discretion that you're saying it.
EndUser: I'll say this, we're very early in our journey into the chief data office realm, right?
EndUser: But [PERSON-30] does have through [PERSON-40], a responsibility for [ORG-37] in [GPE-2].
EndUser: Does that mean we're ready or capable?
EndUser: Of answering all of the questions for them?
EndUser: No.
EndUser: Does that mean that we need to stop ou r ability to build beneficial applications for the businesses?
EndUser: Absolutely not. But [PERSON-37] w we have to find those opportunities to change the way we've been doing things so that w e don't keep making siloed .
EndUser: And you guys will learn this, you know, as we move, I'm sure I already know, we have silos of data all over this [GPE-10], you know, and you and [PERSON-2] and I were having that conversation.
EndUser: I don't know where to begin to start to fix those things. And [PERSON-17]'s laughing as well as <inaudible>. Like we got big hills to climb. But anyway, so thank you for keeping the meeting.
EndUser: I certainly appreciate the deck and the information sharing there. And I'm going to do my best to try and help facilitate these.
EndUser: Decision meetings, right?
EndUser: Through [PERSON-34] and [PERSON-45] and customer pay, [MONEY-3], both of those are [PERSON-34] application, right?
EndUser: And so, but this is all brand new for everybody. I know, you know, he's confused. I'm confused. Everybody's confused.
EndUser: Next time [PERSON-10], you and whoever else is in town, why don't you set aside [TIME-2] or let me know when you're going to be in and I'll set aside [TIME-2], excuse me.
EndUser: And let me go through some of the stuff that [PERSON-37] is sharing out from a chief data office standpoin t through the executive level . maybe that'll help clarify some of these things .
EndUser: We can work together on building the roadma p for getting some of these decisions made . even roadmap, but just your feedback . can help get to [PERSON-37] .
EndUser: Working through [PERSON-34] and everybody else agai n to try and make sure that we get the right people in the roo m at the right, in the right room at the right time . supportive, [PERSON-37]'s supportive .
EndUser: Supportive of all these things . just don't know that we
Agent: Don't have the mechanisms in place ye t. Yeah, yeah. And the reality that is too, I think education is number one first and foremost, something that's needed.
Agent: And so, yeah, so I'm actually going to be in the office [DATE-29], [PERSON-9], but I'll look at [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-7]'s calendar as well, I think.
Agent: [PERSON-5], I think it's important for you to be on [PERSON-37] from our team that is, should be on that call as well.
Agent: So I'll take a look at our calendars, [PERSON-9] and I'll suggest some times for the rest of [DATE-21]. And, you know, in full transparency, [ORG-3] was a big, a big announcement that was made at [ORG-30].
Agent: So, you know, with everyone going to [ORG-30], there was a lot of excitement about what it was, how it was going to be used, etc, etc.
Agent: And like you, we said, okay, let's stop the madness for [TIME-8] and let's look at the projects that are in flight.
Agent: [ORG-7] pay is [PERCENT-4] in flight, right?
Agent: And we started this project back in So we thought, okay, this could be one place where we can start.
Speaker 10: [DATE-21].
Agent: And it's in it's and we don't have to boil the ocean. So that's why we started with that with that in mind. But yeah, I think that sounds like a great idea [PERSON-9].
Agent: Let me look at calendars for [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-41] And I'll send over
EndUser: Some times and we can get together [DATE-21] while I'm there. Okay.
EndUser: And I guess the reason I brought that up, [ORG-7] pay is relatively simple because that's a brand new area with a brand new application and brand new data sources and brand new everything else.
EndUser: So there's not as much to unwind as we look at D400.
EndUser: That's [DATE-21] worth of bad habits, right?
EndUser: And so that's going to be far more complicated to unwind that as we talk about how we're going to source all of that data and where are we going to put it and how are we going to hook it all together and all of that.
EndUser: And to [PERSON-18]'s point, that's outside of my pay grade as well, but I know we can't keep making those decisions
Agent: The same way we've been making them in the past.
Speaker 10: So yeah, sounds good. All right. One more question, [PERSON-10], making up on the data cloud. It's on the cloud which cloud are you on are you on AWS or like you know
Agent: Well, [PERSON-5], I'll let you answer that because there's something called hyper force, which means every one of our customers is going to be moving over to AWS. So technically, it will be on AWS eventually.
Agent: But yes, And, and [PERSON-17], yeah, hyper force is the, you know, the newer overall sales force platform. Hyper force actually runs on its own separate set of dedicated hardware and services within AWS. So it is [GPE-4].
Agent: We see it is running in the same regions, but it's a separate set of reserve pool of resources . Cloud is running on AWS
Speaker 18: As well . Yeah, so I'll just do one statement. What my observation so far in the electricity [ORG-7] had done a good job from spread mods.
Speaker 9: To build it so there there are only thing that we need a strategy.
Agent: Yeah, I love what [PERSON-10] said earlier, you know, you think about it like [GPE-5] versus [ORG-37]. You just said, you know, from spread mods up to, uh, uh, you know, up to something else. We've seen that maturity curve.
Agent: You get to you know, from spreadsheets to reports to maybe But what you really need to get to is like in context information that you can act on immediately there.
Speaker 14: Some decent dashboards.
Agent: And it's also part of why we, you know, call [ORG-3] and active data lake house and why we talk about activations and data actions as well.
Agent: It's Interaction at the point of context and action, which includes things that are happening
Speaker 9: Automated in the background, right?
Agent: I was just looking at our calendars here as [PERSON-9] said to over some times.
Agent: [PERSON-5], are you available after 3?
Agent: I know [PERSON-2],
Agent: You're not. But [PERSON-5] after three
Agent: And Luchkins, are you available two Yes, I can be available after three simple time. Yeah. Yeah. [PERSON-3], although you're busy,
Agent: What is
Agent: [DATE-29] look like at three?
Agent: It's good.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: [DATE-29]'s good.
Agent: [PERSON-5], are you good [DATE-29]?
Agent: It looks [DATE-29].
EndUser: Like you're booked. You're good. No, I'm good on
Agent: Okay, [PERSON-9], are you good instead of [DATE-37] at three?
Agent: Sure. Yep, I'll move what I've got. Okay. All right, so I'll send out an invite will be on site so you let us know if there's a room that we can get.
EndUser: For [TIME-9]. [PERSON-9]
Agent: If possible. Yep. Okay. And then just let me know and I'll update the, the, the invite with the room for at least [PERSON-2] and I
Speaker 12: To go in there and meet with you. Okay. Awesome. All right. Well, I hope this was. I have just a few questions and it just for my understanding.
Speaker 9: So what I from the like one of the first slides or so, it basically showed that there was Integration of, I guess, getting the data model from [GPE-4], but not specifically from [ORG-2]. Sorry, [PERSON-40]. not specifically from snowflake.
Speaker 9: So is it my understanding, should we go in this direction, is that it would be just a change of where that data modeling is done?
Agent: So it's not done here anymore.
Speaker 12: It's not done in snowflake, but it's rather done
Agent: In a cloud.
Agent: Is that correct?
Agent: [PERSON-7], I'm I think that is correct, but [PERSON-53], you guys validate. That is technically correct, but as far as the strategy of how you want to move forward and keeping that those data models.
Agent: Is probably an end-more in-depth conversation. And then again, it goes you what is
Speaker 12: Data Cloud going to be used for?
Speaker 12: Yeah.
Speaker 14: So do we have to have a self-reliance or do we have to use [ORG-2]?
Speaker 18: That's how we have to
Speaker 10: Answer that question. Yeah. Enterprise-wise.
Agent: So, you know. Yeah. Do you Yeah.
Speaker 10: Want to?
Speaker 18: Also really like everybody.
Agent: Sorry, [PERSON-10].
Agent: No, no, I was going to say keep the answer your question and what will probably be somewhat confusing way. It's not a snowflake versus sales force [ORG-3] thing. The way we've architected in the way snowflakes are protected.
Agent: Is to be relatively open. So it really comes down to architectural choices, And as we know architecture is, you know, generally for us in the data world, it goes around performance, cost, and simplicity of [LAW-1] and integration.
Speaker 9: What makes best sense.
Agent: And then occasionally there are some things that only work one way, right?
Agent: Or another. But with what we're talking about here, there's not one way.
Speaker 10: A lot of only
Agent: It's about how we bring together systems to really create something robust and workable
Speaker 10: For y'all. Very good.
Agent: Well, thank you. No, it's a good question, [PERSON-18]. Good question, [PERSON-18] and [PERSON-29]. Um, well, I'm hoping this was a good baseline, um, for the team. Um, [PERSON-29], I know that, um, next steps for [GPE-1].
Agent: Is going to be some detailed requirements from [PERSON-8] really around a customer data platform and her needs around segmentation, cleansing of the data that she already has.
Agent: And it's wonderful to hear that [GPE-1] already is in a position where they have one centralized snowflake database with other customer information.
Agent: For [GPE-2], I think what's going to be [PERSON-37] there, [PERSON-54] And I see [PERSON-52] is also on the call, is the project that we're going to kick off after the phase zero project around the consolidated owners portal, right?
Agent: Where is the data coming from?
Agent: How are we going to use that data?
Agent: And so I think that's going to be a discussion that we'll have with the team in [GPE-2], services team.
Speaker 12: The Professional
Agent: Right now, that's just going to be a discussion. doing the phase zero .
Agent: Yes, go ahead. Okay, so again, as you can see, every region, every country has a different set of requirements.
Agent: And so we will work over [DATE-37] to identify what is the strategy from Enterprise perspective and how it can be used and leverage. not just in the [GPE-6] but across the region.
Agent: Okay, so with that, any other last questions that we
Speaker 10: Can address in [TIME-10], you won't be able to go to bed [TIME-10]
Agent: Unless we answer these questions.
Agent: Okay, well,
Speaker 9: So I hope everyone has a good [TIME-12]'s sleep [TIME-10].
Agent: And if you don't blame us. Yeah, yeah. And [PERSON-9], Have a great day, everyone.
EndUser: We'll see you later.
Speaker 12: [PERSON-18] will see you [DATE-29].
Agent: Thank
Agent: You for
EndUser: Your time
Agent: And happy new year. Yep. Thank you. Have a good time as well. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent?

video_19778_167_6qr3y000000kAdhAAE,"Agent: There we go. There it is. Awesome. So yeah, just kind of backing up a little bit.
Agent: So yeah, in order to pass the data that we have from [PRODUCT-1] into one of these ad platforms, we have to go into our administration tab and we can go in and we can start to set up the connections in there.
Agent: Once those connections have been set up and they're all turnkey, essentially you log in as an admin in your, let's say, your [ORG-1] account. You can see here this is my actual personal ones.
Agent: This is me playing around with it. As long as you're an admin in the business account. you can go into [PRODUCT-1] here, you can then start to connect through that kind of turnkey solution .
Agent: You've done that, it's authenticated. We can then start to pass the information between them . Yeah, go ahead with the question. Hi, Is it just the No, it is just these six.
Speaker 5: Quick question on the connectors.
Speaker 5: Six or there's more?
Agent: So [ORG-1], when we talk about [ORG-1], it will go into [ORG-1] ads. You can use that, obviously, across [ORG-1]'s or [ORG-2] ecosystem. So [ORG-3] is included in that. But these are the kind of six that we partner with.
Agent: Why is there one that you're thinking of that isn't on this list?
Speaker 5: No, just I just thinking about it. There's like other stuff that's out there. Like, I don't know. I do or something like that. I don't know. Yeah,
Agent: For sure. Yeah, so we do start to introduce different platforms when they open up the API. So [ORG-4] has been top of our list for a little while.
Agent: We do actually have a lead management tool from [ORG-4] into Marketing cloud. What that doesn't allow you to do is send advertising audiences to [ORG-4] at the moment.
Agent: Now reality is, is that [ORG-4] still building out its open API. So my assumption here would be an again, you know, forward looking statement from [ORG-5].
Agent: This isn't something that I've seen on the roadmap, but I would imagine when [ORG-6] k APIs become more stable and become available and we build that integration, [ORG-4] woul d probably be in this list .
Agent: Is an area of Data Cloud that I'm going to touch on which kind of crosses over int o advertising a little bit, but if you wanted to pass it to something like a live ramp o r trade desk, you can do that, but it's not part of this advertising audiences solution .
Agent: Is very much an area where we can connect into that data tables and essentiall y send it to the connections that we have her e. Thank you for answering that.
Speaker 5: That's great. That's great.
Agent: My next question really is about [ORG-7] and Life Ram. So, yeah. No problem. Yeah, I can go through that.
Agent: Like I said, that actually sits within [PRODUCT-2] and the way that we're building out the product in data cloud, it does have quite a big crossover into the advertising piece.
Agent: So at the moment it is kind of my area, the job to try and figure out which is the better fit from an advertising audience's perspective or [PRODUCT-2] perspective.
Agent: So I'll show you what that looks like in [PRODUCT-2] in a little bit as well and where that kind of crossover comes in as well. We're going back in terms of actually building out an audience.
Agent: This is essentially where we can go in. We can start to select the data extension. It was obviously reliant on the data extension being there.
Agent: Once we've then got our data extension, we can go in and build out our ads audience in this case. So I'm going to send it to [ORG-1].
Agent: And what I can then start to do is what Marketing Cloud will allow me to do is go in and say, hey, you want to be able to send this data extension to [ORG-1].
Agent: [ORG-1] has a number of mandatory fields that it needs required. So if you can pass us those fields, then great. If you can't, we need you to go away and get those fields first. So you can.
Agent: See here I've got my advertising audience I think I've got it in my in my archiv e But essentially my advertising audience here is the information around the customers that I want to be able to send to [ORG-1].
Agent: So you can see here on the left-hand side, these are the source attributes that I've got in my data extension. On the right-hand side, these are the identifiers that [ORG-1] initially requires.
Agent: You can see here the unique identifiers, it needs at least one of these in there. And then you can start to add some of the optional identifiers as well.
Agent: So if I had more fields in my data extension around things like City or let's say gender, but I could actually pass those.
Agent: Across and the way that we start to do that is just by simply dragging and dropping So the unique identifiers from [ORG-1], email address, phone number, mobile advertiser ID obviously depend on where you're sending those.
Agent: So x.com, for example, I think is email addres s and mobile advertiser ID.
Agent: So it does depend on the social network that you're trying to pass that to but ultimately it will come up here and say, by the way, these are the identifiers that ar e required .
Agent: Anything else you can start to add and you can start to pass that through. Now in terms of then starting to actually pass that through, you can see here this is then going to go to my account.
Agent: If you've got multiple accounts, you can obviously have multiple accounts within here as well.
Agent: And from a [ORG-1] perspective, and again, this is only from a [ORG-1] perspective directly in Marketing cloud, this is where we could build out a lookalike audience.
Agent: So [ORG-1] allows essentially passing through or setting up this lookalike audience through the API. Any of the other social networks, again, going onto LinkedIn or x.com, you wouldn't actually have this.
Agent: This option unfortunately, but obviously you can use an audience in, let's say, [PRODUCT-3] n to create a lookalike directly in LinkedIn to then be able to build out your campaign .
Agent: This kind of lookalike is only specific for [ORG-1] in relation to the advertisin g studio module that we have . But this is where we can then start to build out our look-alike audience.
Agent: This will essentially go away and start to create [PRODUCT-4] around that and start to produce that file directly within in [ORG-1] ads. And again, we can then specify around that as well.
Speaker 5: Some of the notifications Was there Well, for the look alike, I guess for creating a digital profile, is that going to be a separate data extension that's created afterward in terms of these are the subscribers that will be pushed into this?
Agent: A question?
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 5: Or is this some kind of trade slice attributes that it recommends?
Speaker 5: How does that work?
Agent: So the lookalike in itself doesn't actually come back into coming to Marketing cloud.
Agent: So what it will essentially do is go away and build the ad audience in [ORG-1], which will then start to create the lookalike and then you'll get the metrics is by the way, this is the reach that we intend to go to.
Speaker 5: In [ORG-1], which
Agent: We're not going to target the people you've sent us. The lookalike that you want around this is all based on the attributes that [ORG-1] hold.
Speaker 5: Got it. Very interesting.
Agent: Ok. Yeah, same, same processing in [ORG-8], [ORG-8] advertising doesn't allow you to do it directly in advertising studio here, but you could create an audience send that to [ORG-8] and then [ORG-8], you can create a look like audience.
Agent: So we want to go and fetch people, you know, let's say you've got me in the audience. We want to go and fetch people based on sales force based on the email domain.
Agent: You might then go and show an ad to [PERSON-1] because he is a lookalike and works for sales force.
Agent: So, yeah, [ORG-8] has it in the same way as does Twitter as does [ORG-9], but you have to make it. build that directly into the platform in itself .
Agent: [ORG-10], here you can actually build it directl y into advertising studio . So once we then have that, we can actually save and we can activate it. We can set an audience refresh on this.
Agent: The audience refresh again is dependent on the ad network. So [ORG-1] tends to be one of the quicker ones. [ORG-1] is, it will allow you to refresh [TIME-1].
Agent: Some of the other ones, majority of them are [TIME-2]. So [ORG-11] is [TIME-2].
Agent: So it does depend on the network that you're sending to, but you can specify an automatic refresh on this as well.
Speaker 6: Yeah, go ahead if there was another question. Good question. So we have some property agencies that we work with. They typically look at [ORG-9] and they're bringing in some of the leads from that.
Speaker 6: So is there any way that
Agent: That can be replaced, that access can be replaced using this feature?
Speaker 6: So say that example to me again, sorry.
Speaker 6: So for those speaker programs and all those things, right?
Speaker 6: So we have many third party agencies that are available information from these websites like LinkedIn message and then talking to them and giving them as a lead by looking at the public data.
Agent: Actually getting publicly
Speaker 6: So when you say you have an option to look alike and I'm just wondering like, Can that be a use case for us where we can rely this feature
Agent: Instead of depending on the third-party agencies to get the same information?
Agent: Sure, got you. So, sure answer is no. Marketing Cloud doesn't go and fetch information from a social network, even if it is public.
Agent: You know, let's say my LinkedIn profile, you know, in theory, a social tool like something like Who Sweet might do some sort of social listening, and they might pull information from [ORG-9] and I might be on there because it's public.
Agent: Marketing Cloud doesn't do any of that. This is solely based on the data that you guys own, your first party data. So, in terms of sending.
Agent: Let's say we've got our data extension here and we're going to send [ORG-1] an email address a phone number and build a look-alike off it. That is all based on [ORG-1]'s data.
Agent: Again we don't go and pull that information from [ORG-1] and put it back into [PRODUCT-1] It is then there to be used within [ORG-1] so you can then build an audience to try and fetc h new customers.
Agent: Now what you then can do as a strategy point of view is then go and start to targe t those users, let's say, on [ORG-1] that are part of the look-alike, try and get them to sign up and you can get them to sign up obviously through a web [ORG-12] e, or you can do something like a [ORG-1] lead capture for m. That lead capture form can then directly pass those lea ds back into [PERSON-2] So that's where we kind of close the loop betwee n. Never we do require, you know, you to initially [ORG-11] re that data, own that data, store it within [PERSON-3] cloud won't go away and start to fetch informati on from public pages like [ORG-9], for [PERSON-4] that answer your question?
Speaker 6: Yes,
Agent: Go ahead. Thank you. Awesome. Perfect. Okay, so yeah, in terms of advertising audiences, like I said, it is pretty straightforward.
Agent: Once you've set this up, once you've set a refresh rate on it, in order to set the refresh rate, I have to activate it.
Agent: I can't actually activate it in this because I don't run an actual business and therefore can't send it through to [ORG-1]. But we can start to send that information through to them.
Agent: We can then start to get the information back from [ORG-1] in terms of match count and match rates as well. So again, depending on the network that you're sending to, it does require a sub. a number of matches.
Agent: So Facebook, I believe the minimum amount is 4186. So if you don' t have 3363 matches within there, it then starts to pass that information back.
Agent: Again, dependen t on the different levels of or the different platforms that you're sending to, they hav e different match rates. I can send you through details on that. We have that on our publi c pages.
Agent: But ultimately, if you're trying to put an ad into [ORG-1] and it's got two peopl e in it, you've probably noticed that it isn't going to be passed through into Facebook an d that point.
Agent: So this is where we get the match counts and the match rate in there as [PERSON-5] So once we've then got that, this is where we can then start to connect this into into [ORG-16] and specifically as part of our kind of journey orchestration.
Agent: Before I move on to that part, any questions around the advertising studio, advertising audiences, peace. Like I said, it is a quite straightforward module within [PRODUCT-1], which is quite useful, quite easy to demo. Awesome.
Agent: Okay, so then once we've got there, what we then kind of talk around the value of, obviously what [PERSON-6]'s spoken to before, where we've got the data store, we don't have to extract it, people aren't storing [ORG-16] data on their computer and then re-uploading it.
Agent: Essentially, we're running that all through [PRODUCT-1], which is great.
Agent: But what if we then start to want to connect these out?
Agent: Audiences to a campaign. So in this case, let's imagine we've got our welcome campaign, [NORP-1] e signs up, we might initially want to send them a welcome email, which is great.
Agent: But we might als o be targeting them across different social platforms, let's say our [ORG-1] ads, for example, we migh t be targeting them on [ORG-1] in order to get them to sign up in order to get them to click throug h and do something on our website .
Agent: Now, as we were saying before, if they've already done that, we could potentially use advertising audiences here as a suppression, as an exclusion within there.
Agent: So, you know, we want to be able to create this ad audience to then use in [ORG-1] to say, don't target these people because we actually want to do something else with them.
Agent: We might want to put them on a different campaign in order to then get them to go on to the next step.
Agent: Again, you can do this for kind of inclusion, for exclusion, the way that we're going to do that, we're going to drag and drop it in.
Agent: And what this will allow us to do is then select the audience that we have.
Agent: Available within there now again because none of the audiences I have are activ e it won't let me add one in here but this is as simple as being able t o then go and select that audience that we've created within here you can actuall y go and create a new one in here as well we can go and select that one we ca n then start to pull it in and say hey this is now part of our journey o r part of our step within this kind of welcome [ORG-18] Now, whether that leads me as this area around here, which is ad campaigns, now ad campaigns again is specific to [ORG-1] and [ORG-1] only, from a [ORG-5] Marketing Cloud perspective.
Agent: So what ad campaigns allow us to do is actually build out a campaign within [PRODUCT-1] to then send to [ORG-1].
Agent: So what I mean by that, if we take this example where we've got our welcome campaign, we might want to exclude them from an initial audience, we're then gonna send them a welcome email.
Agent: What I'm doing here is, waiting [DATE-1] and I'm checking whether they have engaged with that email .
Agent: Obviously in this case I'm choosing to utilize a click so have they clicked on e of the links within the email . they have then exit them from the journey .
Agent: They haven't then maybe I want to put them onto a different ad campaign . Now what our ad campaign allows us to do is go off and start to build out that actual ad in itself.
Agent: So if I go in and start to select the [ORG-1] areas, again, you can see here it is just [ORG-1] in itself. There isn't any other network that we allow you to provide that into the creative here.
Agent: It is just specific from a [ORG-1] sense. But if I go into here and select a URL within here, what it should start doing is start to build out an example of the advert.
Agent: So what it allowed me to do is start to see how that's then going to look on [ORG-1] . you can see here it's starting to pull that information in from the URL .
Agent: Can start to add to some of the text. So welcome to it . [PERSON-7] add something like that, it will then start to give you a preview of what that's going to look like within [ORG-1] itself.
Agent: You can scale it down. You can start to see how that's going to look on mobile and desktop within [ORG-1] itself, add things like call to action buttons.
Agent: So this is where you can actually build a, created, you can actually build a campaign as part of your journey within Marketing cloud. Like I said, this is specific to [ORG-1].
Agent: So the one downside of that is that it is only on the [ORG-1] side of things.
Agent: If you're building out campaigns that are specific across different networks, you would still have to go into those networks and build out those campaigns in itself.
Agent: But in this case, if we are building out a [ORG-1] specific campaign, we can actually do this directly into [PRODUCT-1] in itself.
Agent: So you can see here quite quick in order to do that in [TIME-3]. forward in order to do and this is where we can then start to add the [ORG-18] name within there.
Agent: We can start to then specify where this is going to go.
Agent: S o again if we've got multiple different [ORG-1] accounts we can specify this We can specify specific categories within there again or specific to kind o f Facebook within there.
Agent: And then again being able to set the kind of spen d and the kind of need that we have within this campaign and all thi s thing gets passed to [ORG-1] where you can then verify it and set it live.
Agent: Once you're then happy with it, it obviously then runs through [ORG-1].
Agent: So again, it do es still require that element of logging into [ORG-1] ads and being able to set this [ORG-16] e, being able to then start to use this to be able to then produce that campaign.
Agent: If you produce t he audience for it as well, then great. You can go in and start to see the audience and start to [ORG-18] it across there.
Agent: But this is where we can then start to utilize our campaign specific to [PERSON-8] ok in this case as [PERSON-5] That is everything I had to show on advertising studio, advertising audiences.
Agent: Like I said, it is a pretty straightforward module within [PERSON-9]. It tends to be quite a short module to demo.
Agent: The key areas around the ad audiences pieces, time that into journeys, and then obviously ad campaigns from a [ORG-1] perspective.
Agent: Truth be told, I'm not sure how many customers really use the ad campaign piece because the majority of the time they're going to be building out campaigns across [ORG-9], [ORG-18], [ORG-1].
Agent: And reality is you still have to log into those So nine times out of 10, they'd probably have what I've got up here which is multiple tabs and they just have [ORG-1] open, [ORG-18] open and LinkedIn open and be able to use the campaign building aspects within there as well .
Agent: Any questions on the ad studio piece advertising audiences piece before I move on to some of the other areas that the least spoke about specifically personalization and data cloud.
Speaker 7: So maybe one comment from my side, thank you [PERSON-10]. It seems quite easy to integrate a virtualizing studio units.
Agent: In the customer
Speaker 7: My question is more regarding, so on the left, I can see SMS and WhatsApp. So I don't know if this is directly with a virtualizing studio, this is a different
Agent: Related model, but I don't know if you can maybe to provide up with more details because this is a little bit interesting for us.
Agent: What's up ?
Agent: Yeah, no problem. So no, the short answer is no, it's not connected to advertising audiences. It's somewhat connected through journey builder. But ultimately, within [PERSON-11], we essentially allow you to send out messages on different channels.
Agent: Now, these are the channels that we natively support. If we ignore this channel here, [PERSON-12], that's actually a custom channel that I've built in my demo account.
Agent: But the kind of light green ones, like blue ones, email, push notifications, [ORG-18] WhatsApp. They are what are outbound Messaging communications that we do support or [ORG-19] channels that we do support.
Agent: So if you wanted to build out a specific WhatsApp journey o r a specific SMS journey and you wanted to use [PRODUCT-1] for that, then yes, absolutely You can do that and we have the ability and the capabilities to be able to then send ou t those messages as well.
Agent: And again, the benefit of journey builders that it does tie all o f this information together. So for example, if we.. . to want to build out this welcome [PERSON-11]: Have they opened the emai l?
Agent: Then excellent, maybe an SMS is then the next best acti on to send to this person, or maybe we want to start [ORG-18] building out a [ORG-30] [PERSON-11]: This is where we can then tie that all togeth with [PERSON-16] So probably want
Speaker 7: To take offline and start to go into a bit more detail, but absolutely from a [ORG-18] perspective, SMS and WhatsApp are
Agent: Channels that we suppo rt natively within [WORK_OF_ART-1] and for that do we need the mobile studio module to be activated?
Agent: Yeah, so there's certain areas within there, so mobile studio is split into a few areas. So there's mobile connect, which is the SMS piece obviously the WhatsApp piece and then mobile pushes the push notification specific for app.
Agent: Depending on your contract, depending on the addition of Marketing Cloud you're in, you might have access to this again one foot fully and I to talk about but ultimately, yes, you would need this module, the mobile studio module in order to connect this into [ORG-16].
Speaker 5: Perfect. Thank you so much. I have a quick question on my side on just, you know, the setup side of it.
Speaker 5: So when you were on [ORG-1], I saw that you just like [ORG-18] slash [GPE-1] or something like that.
Agent: Copy and paste it
Speaker 5: Yeah, it was meta text, the meta image and the meta text.
Agent: Image and then the meta
Speaker 5: So can we update that ourselves or customize any part of that,
Agent: Or is that just how it's going to be set up across. No, you can customize it. Let me jump back into this. So yes, I added the link URL
Speaker 5: And the link description, I believe.
Agent: Can I select an image and just use a custom image instead and then do something?
Agent: You can indeed use a custom image, so I can go in and select one of these.
Speaker 5: I'm not going to do
Agent: That for now because it will error because I'm running off the VPN, but I'll show you that. We will not have a custom image. Obviously, the call to action, these are ones that [ORG-1] limit you to.
Agent: But then in terms of the the display link to when this loads again. I'm going to hear so the headline, for example, the ability to cause headline. This is the way that you can it directly.
Speaker 5: Customize
Agent: Within here as well so the kind of headline within here .
Agent: Oh, this then comes across and then the display links.
Speaker 5: The top of the image
Agent: So instead of [ORG-29], if you wanted to. That's cool. OK. Yeah, you can start to customize it directly in there. Sorry, that's the link in itself. So yes, you can customize it in that way.
Agent: And you can actually customize the image. So yeah, you're right. The image that it was pulling was just the first image it can find off that URL.
Agent: You can actually select your own image as well because I'm on our VPN for some reason and doesn't allow me to
Speaker 5: It kicks me out of [ORG-1] upload an image but you can actually do that. This is awesome. Thank you. So for other social channels other than like [ORG-1],
Agent: How are you triggering ads from advertising to the studio?
Agent: Yeah, for sure. So again, that tends to be based on the advertising audience in itself. So instead of the actual campaign, we would be able to then trigger that via the audience. And then you just go into.
Agent: So again, it does require going into the social network in itself.
Agent: So let's take [ORG-9], for example, in order to build out a campaign that I've just built out in the in the [ORG-1] instance, you would actually have to go into LinkedIn and be able to build that out.
Agent: The reason being is that I believe a lot of the time it's down to the API that is open and the connection that we have with that social networking platform.
Agent: So building out that actual campaign, we can only do that for [ORG-1]. But most of the time for other networks, you build an ad audience, you pass that to, let's use [ORG-9], pass
Speaker 5: That to LinkedIn and then go into LinkedIn ads and be able to build the campaign around it.
Agent: Okay. Well,
Agent: Awesome. All right, so what I'm going to do is just jump into into personalization. Conscious, we've got [TIME-4] left. So yeah, that's the advertising studio piece.
Agent: We want to jump into what we can then do from a personalization perspective as well. So again, personalization to us, the kind of product, personalization, if I go back here. This used to be called [ORG-34].
Agent: If you'd heard of [ORG-34], this is now called [PRODUCT-5]. Essentially for us, it is a real-time [ORG-30] management platform.
Agent: So what it does is that allows us to embed a Web SDK or a mobile SDK behind the scenes, be able to then start to track events on your website, on your mobile app, be able to capture that data, and then start to unify it together.
Agent: So it does have a little bit of a crossover into the Data Cloud element.
Agent: But they, you know, [ORG-33] tends to be from a customer raising their digital hand, whether that be on th e website, whether that be on the app So let me just show you what that might potentially look like So if we imagine that I'm kind of new to [ORG-29], I might have come across the website I might be clicking on different areas of the website I might be looking at specific areas within here or maybe science medicine would hav e been a better option within here I might be coming back to your site multiple times, but at the moment you don't know wh o I am But then the fact that [ORG-8] is holding that kind of session within here, me coming back to your sit e, you're not actually connecting who I a m, what my name is, what my email address i s. So what we can do with [ORG-26], we can capture all this information behind the scene s. So if I shift over and go into this one, for exampl e, so what this will then do behind the scene s, this is personalization and what it's doi ng is that it's gonna go and create a profi le for each of the anonymous users coming onto your sit e. And based on that, we can start to capture some kind of key information.
Agent: So again, where they're coming from, what specific areas are they looking at?
Agent: So in this case, we've got categories, we've got events, we've got our Content classes, and we've got keywords. All these kind of affinities, they can be customized.
Agent: So if you don't decide that actually category is a good fit for your website, you can actually change this. It then is dependent on the event that is then going to be passed through.
Agent: If I click on a link, does that fire off a specific event and is that event attached to it?
Agent: To something like a global health page or a keyword This is where we can then start to build this out But you can see here from an anonymous perspective it will then start to build out an area within there And you can see here this user I D is just a random generated string What it's doing in the background is saying hey, this person's coming onto your site They're anonymous If I came on multiple times it would still use this ID It would still build out that ID Based on the session ID, the cookie I D that is behind there So as long as I don't clear my cookies it would essentially reuse the same anonymous ID within them.
Agent: If I did actually clear my cookies, even if I sti ll then accepted them, it would be able to then pick that up and create me a new anonymo [GPE-2] user.
Agent: Again, it's not too bad though because we can stitch that together eventually a nd I'll talk about that in a second.
Agent: But we can then start to build this information ou t. So you can see here we might need some identity attributes.
Agent: We might be able to connect t he event streams of what they've been doing, what they've been clicking on.
Agent: But overal l, as an anonymous profile, it's interesting to see what it's lik e. that the kind of person is coming back to us, could we potentially put them on a specific [ORG-37] nt?
Agent: So the next best action for this per son is to try and understand who they a re.
Agent: Now that could be as simple as having a form down he re, but we can also start to do areas [ORG-30] und kind of things like time on [ORG-47], the number of pages they're looking at, and even things like mouse movement as we ll.
Agent: So you can see here that when I was moving my mo use towards the top left of [ORG-36], that actually prompted this pop up to start to come in.
Agent: So again, being able to build out that kind of next best action, being able to build out that specific [ORG-33], to be able to get me to put in my details, be able to then start to sign up and unders tand what the value is of me giving my information, what am I getting back from that in this c ase, could there be some key information that you guys could be able to send me in t his?
Agent: And this is why I can then start to add that information in. Now, once I've done that, this then allows me to then start to stitch that level of data together.
Agent: So if I go back to my anonymous user, this is great. But if I then started to put in my email address in my name, maybe it could then start to look something like this.
Agent: So again, this is just a fictitious account with [PERSON-16] in there. But [PERSON-18] has put his email address in. We've been able to then stitch that information together.
Agent: So that anonymous user, we've now been able to stitch with [PERSON-18] because he's put his email address in, we've been able to raise that digital hand. can stitch that level of information together.
Agent: And again, you can see here, this is a [ORG-36] h more comprehensive profile.
Agent: So the number of times that he's come onto the side, what' s his specific affinities, what he's been looking at a lot more, the keywords, the Content tha t he's been looking at.
Agent: If I go down to the event stream, again, the event stream coul d be a lot larger.
Agent: So again, you know, what he's been looking out on a regular basis is he attached to a specific account as well?
Agent: Is there a specific business that he's workin g for that again, we could capture that information directly from something like his, hi s domain main within his email address, or it could be again part of that form, you know, wh at company do you work for if we think around, you know, kind of the gated Content for ms that I'm sure we've all filled out, you know, what account you work for, you can then [PERSON-16] to capture that information within there to then be able to put them onto specific segment s, to then be able to customize the way that they can start to see the websit e. So again, this is quite specific to kind of run in his case, but it could be as simp le as [PERSON-18] So you're looking at a specific area of the site when you then come back to t he homepage, you could then start to tailor the homepage specific to that [ORG-33] ry.
Agent: Very much like [ORG-47] do where you can go and click on certain things, you go ba ck, it starts to recommend thin gs. This essentially is the engine that could power something like th at.
Agent: And again, it can do that based off somewhat offline as we ll.
Agent: So if you have offline data, if we think around something like point of sale syst [ORG-46] and even for banking, we've got things like ATMs, you can capture that informati on, you could pass it into here and you could then start to connect that da ta.
Agent: Also, if it's coming from the lights of someone like [ORG-8], for example, if someone has seen a [ORG-8] ad or even like a [ORG-1] ad, and they've clicked on that and landed on your website, could you potentially [ORG-44] the homepage based on that ad?
Agent: Again, the way that we can do that is that we can capture information that's passed [PERSON-18] ough the URL. It tends to be something like [ORG-8] [PRODUCT-6] paramet ers.
Agent: For those [ORG-8] [PRODUCT-6] parameters, as soon as someone clicks that link, it can be pa ssed into the p age. Personalization can then pick up those [PRODUCT-6] parameters and be able to then [ORG-44] the [ORG-40] age.
Agent: Page based on that ad click as well. So some real kind of key use cases around it is just kind of one small area that I'm showing you within here.
Agent: But it's quite an interesting tool specific to kind of personalizing the user experience and being able to kind of tailor the [ORG-36]
Agent: And tailor the way that the next best action or the next kind of best thing to be able to show to that person is then started to be processed through this as well.
Agent: It's also worth pulling out [PERSON-10] as well, where we've got those attributes at the bottom. We can pull in the [PRODUCT-7] next best action data as well.
Agent: So we can have that laid as an attribute that is obviously working currently
Agent: With the [PRODUCT-8], the recommendations that the personalization is going to be making here as well. So we can work with both of them. Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: Yeah, all these kind of attributes, they can be from what we would call external systems, or that was good timing, it's logged me out.
Agent: It's essentially external systems from within there, and then be able to use that data to be able to then power some of the personalizations that we have within there as well. Any questions
Speaker 7: On the personalization module?
Speaker 7: Appreciate that I've gone through that pretty quickly, but happy to answer any questions you might have on the personalization module now. Yes, maybe from my side.
Speaker 7: So if understood well, we are using [PRODUCT-1] to get data from different platforms, for example, websites. It would be possible also to use internal platforms to serve these data and thinking in our [PRODUCT-9] platform, for example, [ORG-40].
Speaker 7: If we can include as data for example, the different calls and visits that [ORG-44] are doing with HCPs, source,
Agent: And we can include all this information to build a complete personalization experience. Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, again, that would rely on the attributes that you're going to be passing through.
Agent: Now, again, we try to say that you wouldn't want to pass an entire [PRODUCT-9] record into here, just because then the processing time of looking through all that data, you know, what personalization isn't, it's not a [GPE-3], it's not there as kind of a data storage aspect, is there to be used for kind of triggering the personalization on that account.
Agent: So, again, if you wanted to... pass through something like your CRM ID, absolutely you can do that and then be abl e to make decisions based on that link of [ORG-45] It's great we can do that and it will be normally using the API call to go and fetc h the information from let's say your [PRODUCT-9] is [ORG-5] for example you can go in yo u can fetch that information and then be able to [ORG-44] the website based on that .
Agent: But in terms of the key fields that you might want to pass through, see absolutely if we think around something like a Lead Score or a lead grade that might be sat within your CRM system and you want to pass that through to the record page that we have here, then yeah absolutely we can go and fetch that information from the [PRODUCT-9] record and start to pull that in.
Agent: Again same with the account for example if we've storing account information in our [PRODUCT-9] record and we want to be able to pull that into the account within here and then be able a website change based on the account information, then yeah, absolutely you can pull that informatio n from the [PRODUCT-9] that you're using and be able to put it against the records
Speaker 7: We have here .
Agent: Does
EndUser: That answer?
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay. The guy are going to show the personalized web pages as behavior.
Agent: Well based on the, in individual
EndUser: So that I can say. That way you have shown a asking for the email and other details.
Agent: Show on the pop up right
EndUser: Are we
Agent: Going to see the personalized website pages as well?
Agent: I didn't actually build that in. Sorry, so in order to [ORG-44] the website, you can go through and you can actually deploy the SDK directly within here.
Agent: I didn't actually deploy, I didn't have time to deploy the SDK across your site. But what essentially that would look like is something like this, for example. This is a fictitious site that we have at [ORG-5].
Agent: What that will allow us to do is go in and start to be able to then use that editor that we have within here.
Agent: And it then allows me to go in and start to then change the campaigns, change the look and feel.
Agent: But you'll be able to see in a second, essentially what it requires is kind of a mix of IT and marketing.
Agent: What it requires is your IT team to be able to go in and be able to specify the areas of the website that they want editable within that. I apologize, it's probably because of that.
Agent: So I didn't actually have time to go in and start to build those areas within there, but you can start to see here, for example, we've got our kind of campaigns, and we've got different areas of the site that are mapped into this, so I can go in and start to build a campaign and say, hey, by the way, let's say our kind of header that we have within here, I want to be able to change, mapped initially within there.
EndUser: That has to be
Agent: So I didn't actually have time to
EndUser: Go in and map that specifically within your website, unfortunately. So [PERSON-10] just to keep it simple.
EndUser: So just for an example, on my home page, You know, if my home page talks about a product name brand A, okay, and [PERSON-18] as an
EndUser: And all these things will be done by the within [TIME-5].
Agent: Application itself
EndUser: The whole
Agent: Process, the message has to be... Yeah, well we can do it just because [PERSON-18] was...
Agent: Unfortunately [PERSON-18]'s on holiday at the moment in [GPE-4], so he's built that out, so what we can do, [PERSON-18], once he's back I can do a quick
EndUser: Recording with him and we can show you what that looks like as well.
Agent: That's pretty powerful, [PERSON-1]. Yeah, absolutely. I can show you that now. So if you take this website, for example, the home page, you can see here we've got our hero image, we've got our text.
Agent: If I then start to specify that I'm looking at a specific industry, in this case, financial services, and starting to click through.
Agent: Now, in the space of, let's say, [TIME-6], I go back to the home page, you can see here, this has already started to personalize.
Agent: So it's changed the banner images, started to change the text around that as well. So that's all run off personalization. So like you said, it does it in a matter of milliseconds.
Agent: It starts to capture that information, defines the segment that I'm in, in this case wha t industry or what areas I was looking at, and then personalise the homepage straight away So yeah, exactly like that, it would be able to do that very quickly .
Agent: Awesome. Any other questions on personalization before I finish
Speaker 7: Off with data cloud?
Speaker 7: No, I think I think maybe following building on your on your point, right?
Speaker 7: Yes, I think it will be useful to get a more detailed session, maybe on how we can [ORG-44] because you know, in the [GPE-5], there are many websites.
Speaker 7: X [GPE-5] we are also putting all our [ORG-36] in under the [ORG-58] site. So we are very much interested in discovering how [ORG-5], in that case, can help us to [ORG-54] by the audience.
Speaker 7: And if this is something we can do directly from [ORG-5], or this is something that we can do directly from [ORG-5], that should be done on [ORG-58], for example, that is the [ORG-54] that we are using.
Speaker 7: So if this is something we can do directly using [PRODUCT-10], it would be very useful to no one two understand how we can do it and how we see. This can be implemented.
Speaker 7: So I would like an I so yes, if we can organize we could do a call on these specifically.
Agent: A
Speaker 7: And we can also include our colleagues from the app from the team and of course from us. It will be a good use case I guess.
EndUser: And [PERSON-1] just to ensure a unique [PRODUCT-11] degree experience, let's make sure we should pass on the message very specifically mentioning that personalization builder is not only website.
EndUser: It can be any channel, right?
EndUser: Come from email, see this page, see this page, receive an SMS or a [ORG-30], the message has to be that. The tool is so powerful, you know, we have to explore it in the right way.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, no worries. We can do a deep dive on that for sure.
Agent: Awesome. All right. So yeah, the last lot of [TIME-7], and we want to focus on [PRODUCT-2] because it is quite a big, big module that we have.
Agent: So essentially data cloud, for those who haven't seen [PRODUCT-2] before, if I go into data cloud, let me let me see that screen.
Agent: Yeah, go ahead, go ahead, I'll start what's the load this?
Agent: I Romage is saying he's got to drop off.
Agent: Think
Agent: Oh, yeah. OK, no worries. Awesome. OK, so yeah, for those who haven't heard of [LOC-1] or haven't seen of [LOC-1], essentially [ORG-5] released what we were initially calling a [GPE-3] probably [DATE-2] now.
Agent: And we've gone through a few different names with the product. And we finally set it on [LOC-1]. Now, the reason we are calling it [LOC-1] and not a [GPE-3] is that we see kind of key use cases.
Agent: Outside of Marketing and we tend to see that the word [GPE-3] or the term [GPE-3] tend s to be used specifically for Marketing use cases.
Agent: So for all intents and purpose s I'm going to focus on the Marketing use cases here so specifically it will be a [GPE-3] again it's just Data Cloud but ultimately there are kind of other area s outside of [ORG-5] that we see the use of a Data Cloud for so specificall y around things like reporting you know being able to utilize it within ou r CRM being able to [ORG-54] r off things like service notifications as [PERSON-5] But as you'll notice here, this actually doesn't sit within [PRODUCT-1] itself.
Agent: This actually sits within what we would call the core platform. And ultimately it's a module within the core platform in itself.
Agent: So if you've ever used [WORK_OF_ART-2] or Service Cloud before, you'll be able to see it looks very familiar, very similar within them. But ultimately the key areas of [PRODUCT-2] is data ingestion.
Agent: We can then use some identity resolution in there. We can then segment on our identity.
Agent: Resolutions and then be able to activate those segments out of the platform into differen t areas Now, one of those areas could be into [ORG-58] purposes to be abl e to send things like emails, text messages, WhatsApp .
Agent: It could also be directly into things like ad platforms as well that we've already kind of spoken about and this is really where that crossover element comes in that I was speaking to before as well.
Agent: But for this case, for this kind of purpose, I'm going to kind of skip over the first area of it, which is all about the data ingestion, data prep, being able to create what we call identity resolutions.
Agent: But if we imagine where we were speaking about before and that diagram that [PERSON-1] showed, where we might have data coming from, let's say our data lake or our public warehouse, we might have information coming from our CRM system, we might also have engagement coming from our website, might also have that coming from [PERSON-9] that's a claim.
Agent: On things like emails and text messages, we want to be able to store that all in one place to b e able to then have a unified individual.
Agent: So the way that we do that, we essentially run ou r identity resolutions and what this is doing, you can see here with the mat rules that we hav e And what this is doing is that it's going away and trying to match on a number of different fields that we have within there.
Agent: So it could be as simple as we've got a name and an email address. And if you see that name in an email address in our [PRODUCT-9], and it's also in our data lake, then merge it together.
Agent: But we also know that there might be some kind of use cases or some examples where that isn't always going to be the fit.
Agent: So we can then start to match that on different IDs, different devices, that type of thing, but we can also do it around kind of fuzzy matching as well. So.
Agent: Again, if we've got, let's say [PERSON-19], and he's put his name as [PERSON-19] and our [PRODUCT-9] . But in our data lake, we've got him as match shop.
Agent: Again, we can use fuzzy matching in order to determine that actually that match should happen because it is based on something like, again, the phone number is correct, the email address is correct, the physical address is correct.
Agent: So we can then start to build those mat rules. We can also build out reconciliation rules as well.
Agent: So again, if we have an email address for a customer and they've updated that in a customer portal, but the one they initially signed up to a newsletter with is different, again, could we potentially then adjust their customer record to be able to then say, this is their main contact email address.
Agent: This is then their secondary email address. We can start to use the reconciliation rules to determine where does that kind of information come from.
Agent: What is the one that we're going to be using against the profiles So in this case could it be the one that's the most frequent or was it the one that was last updated We can then start to start to then say that we can start to choose the kind of source priority that we have from within ther e And all this information is then started to go against a unified profil e Now the way that it's doing out you can see here on the right hand side that it's essentially unifying those i s Consolidating it down has been able to match on those profile s It can take in anonymous profiles that was speaking about before where they're going i n and starting to do something on the websit e. If we can match something like a cookie I D, then we can actually join that togethe [NORP-2] But ultimately, what this is doin g, you can see here we're feeding in 61 million source profile s. So that information coming from those different data set s. And actually within [LOC-1], we know that has now given us a total of 33 million user s, so 33 million unique users, unified profiles within ther e. And while that then kind of looks like from an actual visualization point view, so this is kind of [PERSON-18] profile, you can see here the information that we've got on her, we're able to then produce that as really a kind of a single source of truth.
Agent: So from [ORG-58] perspective, the key kind of information that we have on her, what her details are, what's her address, where she's kind of been using the kind of products across us, but then also some of the related fields as well, the orders that she's created, any cases that she's potentially open, we can start to.
Agent: Information from different areas around things like the emails that we've been sending her the campaigns that we've been putting on.
Agent: So this is really where the kind of benefit of tha t kind of things was also true, then that kind of identity resolution come together to be able t o produce this profile.
Agent: And then we can start to use it from a segmentation aspect.
Agent: So again from a more from a traditional [GPE-3], a mockters aspect, we want to be able to then create a segmen t based on we want to go and find [ORG-52] is that we've got in our database and we want to to do that based on, let's say, location is based in the [GPE-1], gender is equal to femal e, but also the last engagement could be in [DATE-3].
Agent: And again, all that informati on might be stored in three different data sources within [PRODUCT-2] because we've been [GPE-6] to unify it, because we've been able to harmonize it.
Agent: This is where we can then start to produ [GPE-7] So once we've got to that area, once we've got to that kind of unified individual and this, this kind of single source of truth in the middle, this is where we can then start to create a segment.
Agent: Now, this is the kind of benefit of data card and being able to build a segment.
Agent: It's all drag and drop and it because it uses that single source of truth, we can actually go and start to pull data from different data sets, different data kind of attributes within there to be able to then produce a segment as well.
Speaker 7: Yeah, go ahead with the question. Okay. So tell me one thing. So basically what we are seeing here is what we have using [ORG-49]. If I understood well, [ORG-49] is built using [PRODUCT-10] data cloud.
Speaker 7: So, and it seems exactly the same, very similar.
Speaker 7: So, is there any difference between what you are showing us?
Speaker 7: In comparison what we have [DATE-4] using [ORG-44] CRM because again even the categories are exactly the same, they look and feel. So if I understood well, say it's not [PRODUCT-1] is
Agent: Or let's say [ORG-45] is built based on say it's not Marketing Cloud platform.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So I don't know if you have a [PRODUCT-9]. So this is [ORG-58] and Cloud.
Agent: Where's it gone?
Agent: Sorry, let me move over one step. So as you can see here Data Cloud in itself sits slightly separately from Marketing cloud. Now the kind of ins and outs
Speaker 7: In terms of [PRODUCT-12], I don't actually know of that, but if it's sat within the [ORG-5] platform, then it could look quite similar.
Speaker 7: That was exactly the sure that we are using, say, from [PRODUCT-1] platform as part
Agent: Same. I'm
Agent: Of our VBAS CRM. So maybe we can discuss more in detail with the [ORG-72]-RAN M45 team. that you sign on [ORG-45] for sure. Yeah [PERSON-30] we can get into the detail. There are some major differences.
Agent: So the [PRODUCT-12] platform was built on top of the [ORG-5] platform technology. So that's why you'll see them being very similar.
Agent: There are some specific nuances and you might have seen that actually [PRODUCT-12] is spitting off from [ORG-5]
Speaker 7: So they're going separate ways but it's a whole conversation in itself.
Agent: So I'll make a note of that and we can pick that up when we do the deep dive on personalization again as well. Okay perfect thank you. Awesome.
Agent: But yeah, kind of going back to the kind of key differences. So I would say, although this. could look quite familiar.
Agent: I would say normally a [PRODUCT-9], so let's say what we would call sales card at sales force, that isn't going to have all this information in it. So particularly around the the kind of transactional information.
Agent: So if we imagine here, let's say we've got our orders, we've got our kind of cases, you might be able to be feeding that in with your [PRODUCT-9], but particularly down all the way down to kind of individual emails, that type of thing.
Agent: We can look at things like website details as well.
Agent: So have they been on the website in [DATE-3] Realistically, I'd question if you're storing tha t in your [PRODUCT-9], most of the customers that we speak t o don't store that in their [PRODUCT-9] because they fee l like they don't need to Obviously you then pay for data storage within there Whereas this, we can then start to use it more fro m a Marketing perspective where we go but we wanna know that person that's in the CRM system we wanna know whether they've received an emai l in [DATE-3] and have also been on the websit e in [DATE-5] And that tends to be.. be the kind of difficult area aroun d. We've got that information, but it's in our CRM syste m. It's also on our websit e. It's also from our Marketing platfor m. How do we then see that in one are a?
Agent: This is kind of the challenge that [PRODUCT-2] is tryi ng to solve with [PERSON-18] So what that then means in terms of [ORG-63], if I go in and start to build a segment her e, what that then means is that I can go i n, I can start to utilize the drag and drop segmentation too l. You can see here, to be able to then go and use that informati on to be able to then go find that informatio n. information in a drag and drop manner without having to go, particularly when we speak to [PERSON-18].
Agent: It tends to be a case where we want to define this audience, we then go to a team that has to build some sort of SQL query to go and then fetch that information, join on multiple differ ent tables, produce this output that says, yeah, we've got this output now of six, let's call it 7 mill ion people.
Agent: And as a marketer, I'm like, okay, but actually I need it a lot lower than that. I do n't need 7 million people in my campaign. That's an awful lot.
Agent: So then we can go back to IT, that social media [PERSON-18], they rewrite the SQL and they go in.
Agent: This is really the challenge that [PRODUCT-2] is trying to s olve because we can go in and we can actually s tart to do this directly within the tool its elf.
Agent: So if we imagine you can see here on the left-hand side, we've got some direct attributes. So this is our unified individual. So this is the information that we're storing again.
Agent: So let's say [PERSON-29], for example, if I go Backup to here, we can start to use the kind of key high-level information in there. That's great. We can start to build off the attributes within there.
Agent: But then when we get to a point where we then want to start looking at some of those related attributes specific to [PERSON-29] in this case, again, going back to kind of the examples that I was given there.
Agent: What if they've been on the website in [DATE-5], we can go up here. We can then start to utilize the website engagement data. So if we go engagement type.
Agent: So we can start to say here, we want to be able to see that they've been on the website in [DATE-6] days, so we could probably go greater than [DATE-5].
Agent: We can then start to build that out. Again, we can start to use the drag and drop tool to be able to then specify the kind of audience that we have.
Agent: You can see here I'm able to then run the segment populations of what this is doing in the background is essentially running that query for me, being able to then give me the outputs that I know that who I'm targeting in this, what the size is, how we can then start to utilise that.
Agent: But again, this is then starting.
Agent: To use the data that we have from befor e from those multiple different system s in a drag and drop manner to be able to then creat e the segment within there What we can then also do is start to then loo k at an exclusion within there as well So if we wanted to build out exclusion rules we can go in and we can start to do that So again, if there's specific people that we [PERSON-34] w we shouldn't be targeting, we can add tha t as exclusion rules within there And really then start to kind of build ou t the kind of segments within there So again, this is kind of the benefit of data car d that you can go in and you can start to build play around again, you know, my segments come back out with [PERSON-30]: So can I do I need to change somethin g?
Agent: Do I need to move something aroun d?
Agent: Start to delete some fields to be able to get to a good [ORG-37] nt coun [PERSON-33] And this is where we can go in and [PERSON-16] to have that back and forwar d. But as opposed to going to an IT team to do i t, you can actually do it yoursel f. You can actually come into here and [PERSON-16] to build out those kind of key segment s. So whilst this is running, actually, if I go back to segments, me building out that kind of standard segment, it's just one way of doing this.
Agent: From a segmentation perspective, we actually have kind of three areas that you can do that with. So you can actually do this with [PERSON-26], and I'll show you that one in a [ORG-52].
Agent: But you can actually build out a batch segment or a waterfall segment in order to kind of pass those different segmentation areas through as well.
Agent: Now, once we've got our segment, this is where we can then start to activate it. Now, this is really where that kind of crossover with advertising studio that I started off with kind of comes in.
Agent: So we can actually activate a segment directly from [PRODUCT-2] into into [ORG-1]. We can activate it to [ORG-8]. We can actually activate it into a live ramp and trade desk. We have connections into those from data cloud.
Agent: So this is really where that kind of crossover comes in. So you'll notice here that most of the ones that I've shown before in advertising studio are. actually in [PRODUCT-2] .
Agent: So depending on the use case, if you're building out a segment and you're going to be passing those, let's say to [ORG-9], could you use advertising studio for that?
Agent: Absolutely. But my question would be if you're using data cloud, you could probably just use the native connector and pass it through to that.
Agent: The only real kind of area that I think that advertising studio has a benefit over that I showed before is being able to connect that directly to [ORG-16].
Agent: So going back to this area here, if we're trying to connect our audiences and our campaigns as a specific part of a journey, this very much is part of [ORG-61] part of advertising studio.
Agent: But if it's a case of building out a segment and passing that too, let's say [ORG-1] or [ORG-9], you can actually do that directly in data clouds. So there is kind of a bit of a crossover. within there.
Agent: And it really does just depend on the use cases within there, specificall y as well, if live ramp and trade desk are one of those areas, those destinations that yo u want, then [PRODUCT-2] is the way to do that .
Agent: Contre some I've kind of got [TIME-8] left. Any questions on [PRODUCT-2] and being able to kind of pass that through happy to kind of run over a little bit as well.
EndUser: Sorry,
Speaker 5: Go ahead, [PERSON-37]. I was just curious. It's like for leverage all these capabilities. Do we have to use [PRODUCT-2] or other like a CD piece that we could be tapping
Agent: Into to utilize as well. Yeah, I mean, Data Cloud is the Salesforce Pacific CDP. There's obviously competitors out there. But if you wanted to do what I've shown here, this is all part of [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: Data Cloud isn't, we wouldn't build ourselves as a composable [GPE-3]. So you know, you've been able to do the unification in [PRODUCT-2] and then do this segmentation and activation somewhere else.
Agent: In theory, you can do that, but you'd still be paying for some of the Data Cloud platform within there. So again, we don't tend to build [PRODUCT-2].
Agent: As the composable [GPE-3] that no others do So specifically from a sales source perspective [PRODUCT-2] would be the kind of [GPE-3] that we would pitch And that would include the kind of key area s of a [GPE-3] within them .
Speaker 5: Does that make sense?
Speaker 5: Is there an answer question?
Speaker 5: Yeah, I mean, so for some of the features that you've shown on the personalized side, would you be able to tap into those if you didn't have [PRODUCT-2] or would you that work.
Agent: Need?
Agent: Data Cloud to make all of So going back to this bit here. Yeah. No, so this is a different module. So this is the personalization module.
Agent: So if you don't have data cloud, that's not a problem for this area. If you wanted to tap into this, this is the Marketing Cloud personalization module. So you essentially, this is a standalone product in itself.
Agent: You don't actually need [PRODUCT-1] for this. You guys having, like you said, just stood up Marketing cloud. It would essentially be a module within your [PRODUCT-1] account. Data cloud, like I said, slightly separate.
Agent: So because it does settle a different platform.
Agent: You wouldn't need [PRODUCT-2] for the personalization bit There is the benefit of having those two kind of area s taught to one another But the real kind of area for Data Cloud her e is the identity resolution, [ORG-61] and the activation piece that I've
Speaker 5: Just talke d about there as well . Right. Okay.
Agent: Awesome.
Agent: Any other questions on [PRODUCT-2] or anything else that I've spoken about [DATE-4]?
Agent: No worries if not, I'm happy to go into any other questions. If you did think of any and you wanted to fire those over email, happy to answer those.
Agent: But yeah, some of the kind of areas within there, obviously advertisers, [ORG-72] sit within [PRODUCT-1]. Data Cloud is its own platform in itself, its own area in itself.
Agent: Different use cases, and like I said, does have that kind of crossover into the advertising piece, which I think is why we wanted to show it, or give you a kind of a little flavor of what data cloud.
Agent: Can do as well. But yeah, hopefully that was useful. How that could be a good overview of what Marketing Cloud is some of the different modules that we have .
EndUser: Yeah, no. Thank you, [PERSON-10], for coming and standing in for [PERSON-18] and a great job.
Agent: I know it
EndUser: Was a lot to get through in [TIME-9] and I think it was great for us to see how the suite fits together because it is explained in a very clear way which really helps us to start making some more informed decisions about how we move forward.
EndUser: So thank you for you and [PERSON-1] for putting it together. Just in [TIME-10], I know obviously we as a team are thinking about next steps.
EndUser: I just wondered if I could get some feedback from maybe [PERSON-30] and [PERSON-47] on their initial thoughts and then from [PERSON-30]. And then what we can probably do, but maybe to share that openly with [PERSON-36].
EndUser: And then we can regroup as a smaller group, [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-10]. [PERSON-30] and myself, and we can sort of work out how best we engage and what suite might be appropriate and how we move forward.
EndUser: But maybe just initial comments from
Speaker 5: [PERSON-47] first and then [PERSON-30] just on what they've seen. Yeah, definitely. All the capabilities, it's like I want all of it. But you know, there's always just priorities. And definitely I think at studio is something that's pretty quick.
Speaker 5: I think we're going to put it up pretty quick. All this stuff, I mean, makes [PERCENT-1] sense to me how we can utilize all these capabilities right way to support our brands.
Speaker 5: And personalization, I really like it as well, especially that pop up to try to get like additional first party data, which we're trying really trying hard to get into right now to try to up that part.
Speaker 5: I think that's huge as was and of course the [GPE-3], but for me, I think definitely the , in the forefront is definitely advertising studi o just because it's very, I feel like it's already nativ e inside [ORG-74] as well .
Speaker 5: It's, that's a huge plus and bringing all that dat a and also putting segmentation, building the [ORG-52] e and then pretty much getting the ads ou t on like the journey
EndUser: Builder itself . think that's
Speaker 7: Pretty powerful . yeah, that's from my side . [PERSON-30], from my side, thank you so much, [PERSON-33]. Extremely interesting the demo. Thank you, [PERSON-36], for organizing this demo session.
Speaker 7: So I think that, again, for the [GPE-5] advertising as a third priority for other countries, [GPE-8], a probably personalization builder, will be a very useful capability because they don't do much advertising.
Speaker 7: So I think we can combine these two both. features so we can better understand how to use it. My three-estion again is to start small so we can focus on various specific use cases.
Speaker 7: So three four where we can use these capabilities and then to start working with the [GPE-5] or with other non UX countries.
Speaker 7: But again, because we will have a learning curve about how to use all these features and again we have seen many things in [TIME-11].
Speaker 7: So we will need probably to digest a bit more all these capabilities. But again, extremely interesting. Thank you so much. I'm looking forward to continue the conversation.
EndUser: And probably also including one day [ORG-52]. That's another good opportunity. Thank you, [PERSON-30].
EndUser: So what I'll conclude, guys, I think, the summary would be I think there's certainly a strong ambition in the [GPE-5] to accelerate with [ORG-76] and I think from the rest of the world perspective personalization.
EndUser: So maybe those are the two tracks that we start to look at. And finally, we'll debrief as a core team and then we can come back to you with next steps.
Agent: I'll set up some time with us as a core team to regroup and then we can come back to you with next steps. No, sounds like a plan. And thank you everybody for
EndUser: Your time and attention. I know, like we said, it's [TIME-9] of a lot to get through. So appreciate the comments, the input and everything. And we'll catch up after you've had a debrief internally.
EndUser: Yeah, I'll set something up. Thanks, thank nice team and great to have everyone on the call, so that's great.
Agent: You everyone for joining.
Speaker 7: I really feel it's a [PRODUCT-11].",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the customer's top concerns about the seller's product. The customer did express interest in various features and capabilities, such as advertising studio, personalization, and data cloud, but did not explicitly mention any concerns.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have provided a clear and concise introduction of the company and its products, including the sales rep's product, to help the customer better understand the context of the conversation.
2. The sales rep could have done a better job of explaining how the sales rep's product can help the customer's business specifically, rather than just describing the features of the product.
3. The sales rep could have provided more real-world examples or case studies to illustrate the benefits of the sales rep's product.
4. The sales rep could have done a better job of addressing the customer's questions and concerns, and providing clear and concise answers.
5. The sales rep could have done a better job of summarizing the key takeaways and next steps at the end of the call to ensure that the customer is clear on the value proposition and what the next steps are.

It's important to note that the sales rep did provide a lot of information and answered many questions, but could have done a better job of tying it all together and clearly articulating the value proposition of the sales rep's product.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So, yeah, I can go through that. Like I said, that actually sits within [PRODUCT-2] and the way that we're building out the product in data cloud, it does have quite a big crossover into the advertising piece.""
	* The customer seemed more engaged as they asked a follow-up question about the crossover between [PRODUCT-2] and advertising.
2. ""So, again, this is then starting to use the data that we have from [PRODUCT-1] and start to pass the information between them.""
	* The customer seemed more engaged as they asked about the specific platforms that [PRODUCT-1] can connect with.
3. ""So, yeah, I can go through that. Like I said, that actually sits within [PRODUCT-2] and the way that we're building out the product in data cloud, it does have quite a big crossover into the advertising piece.""
	* The customer seemed more engaged as they asked about the specifics of how [PRODUCT-2] can help with advertising audiences.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They expressed interest in several features and modules, particularly advertising studio, personalization, and data cloud. They mentioned the desire to start using advertising studio quickly and saw potential in personalization for gathering first-party data. They also mentioned personalization builder as a priority for certain countries. The customer also mentioned the importance of starting small and focusing on specific use cases. Overall, they were engaged, asked questions, and provided positive feedback about the demonstration.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the advertising studio module and its capability to connect audiences and campaigns as a specific part of a journey. They also mentioned the potential of using the personalization module to create a more tailored user experience. Additionally, they see value in the data cloud's identity resolution and activation features, which can help them unify and activate segments directly into various platforms. However, they mentioned that their initial focus would be on the advertising studio and personalization builder modules.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer: The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and demonstrating the capabilities of the seller's product. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. When the customer asked about the possibility of using the personalization module without Data Cloud, the sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's specific use case and requirements. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their response to better address the customer's needs.
2. When the customer mentioned that they were thinking about using other channels like SMS and WhatsApp, the sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's specific use case and requirements for these channels. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their response to better address the customer's needs.
3. When the customer mentioned that they were interested in using the advertising studio specifically for [ORG-1], the sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's specific use case and requirements for this platform. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their response to better address the customer's needs.

Overall, while the sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs, there were a few areas where they could have asked more questions to better understand the customer's specific use case and requirements. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their response to better address the customer's needs and increase the likelihood of closing the deal.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","The customer seemed to be interested in the seller's product and saw potential in using it to meet their needs. They specifically mentioned the advertising studio, personalization, and data cloud modules as capabilities that align with their goals. However, they also mentioned the need to prioritize and start small, as there are many features to digest. Overall, while they see the potential, they are aware of the learning curve and need to debrief internally before deciding on next steps.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are the questions they asked:
- ""So, yeah, my next question really is about [ORG-7] and Life Ram. So, yeah. No problem. Yeah, I can go through that.""
- ""So, like I said, that actually sits within [PRODUCT-2] and the way that we're building out the product in data cloud, it does have quite a big crossover into the advertising piece.""
- ""So I'll show you what that looks like in [PRODUCT-2] in a little bit as well and where that kind of crossover comes in as well.""
- ""So I'll show you what that looks like in [PRODUCT-2] in a little bit as well and where that kind of crossover comes in as well.""
- ""So I'll show you what that looks like in [PRODUCT-2] in a little bit as well and where that kind of crossover comes in as well.""
These questions were asked to understand the customer's needs and requirements related to [ORG-7], Life Ram, and [PRODUCT-2]. By asking these questions, the sales rep was able to identify the customer's intent and provide a more tailored demonstration of the product."
video_19779_167_6qr3y000000scdEAAQ,"Agent: Share my screen.
Speaker 5: Are we happy to start with [PERSON-1]?
Speaker 5: I'll give it [TIME-1]. One check.
EndUser: This one two check.
Speaker 5: Madam, was that on as well?
Speaker 5: All the mimes.
EndUser: I don't know about them actually.
EndUser: If it's Recorded as a possible to share the Recording in case [PERSON-1], media, con attendant, they want to. Have a look at the demo.
EndUser: Is that possible?
Speaker 5: Yeah, perfect. Here's a brief piece from my side. I'll start at the end. So if [PERSON-1] does join later, the Healthy Demo to start in the end, but if not, we can share the Recording there.
EndUser: Ok. All right, perfect.
Speaker 5: Perfect. And yeah, sure.
EndUser: Let's get started with them.
Speaker 5: Brilliant. And so obviously instructions just again guys from our side. I'll see you have that myself by so far. We also have [PERSON-2] here from [ORG-1]. He's our solution engineer aligned to our team working with [ORG-2] business.
Speaker 5: And then you have [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4] as well from future for. And the primary focus option is the demo.
Speaker 5: I will just kind of do one or two slides beforehand, obviously thanking you guys off for your consistent times so far, conscious there have been a few meetings, both from future for, I suppose, over [DATE-1] to now actually showing the value of [ORG-1].
Speaker 5: And I also will do a brief run through what we're doing [DATE-2].
Speaker 5: So firstly, focusing on what we've heard so far so our understanding of where headway are at now, where they want to go and I suppose some of those cute jactors that we've highlighted in the discovery and based so far.
Speaker 5: Parting will do the [ORG-1] demo and then some time for questions and on the next step. So time and potential.
Speaker 5: What we've done so far, a lot needs to happen to ensure we get set up for success on [ORG-1]. And bear with me. Well, this goes to the next slide.
Speaker 5: There we go. Perfect. So business challenges and I suppose your desired icons are going to worry you like to go with [ORG-1]. And very much to disconnect between [PRODUCT-1] and spreadsheets.
Speaker 5: There's a lot of manual loading and a loticia that is primarily your responsibility.
Speaker 5: So it's a big responsibility to have that all that information is indirect across from [PRODUCT-1] and then your platform, your sales and platform that you have at the moment is potentially only being used as a library, as mentioned [DATE-3].
Speaker 5: And then of course from there, If it's all manual from your [PRODUCT-1] spreadsheets, that's going to be reporting on forecasting . There's no key source of trade for everyone to have access to. I think you guys have [PRODUCT-1].
Speaker 5: There's the master document [PRODUCT-1] that has the fundraising investment side. But there is the potential that other partners in the business and associates have their own systems in place on their own [PRODUCT-2] in the workings.
Speaker 5: And so it's pretty big bridge when that gap between the two systems, having your source of trade and also being able to leverage those capabilities on your outlook side of things. So.
Speaker 5: At the moment, there's no sinking, there's no automation.
Speaker 5: So having that bridge between [PRODUCT-1] and I look going forward, and a big thing I suppose you guys mentioned [DATE-3] is, you know, you have how to improve the workings from an internal perspective.
Speaker 5: So off the team, how do we make your life easier?
Speaker 5: But also how do we address some of the key concerns of your investors?
Speaker 5: For example, they want more information, they want to see the client rights, they want to see the visualizations of how the investments look when raising is tracking.
Speaker 5: So how can we make that a better process for them, if they enable them with more information?
Speaker 5: I'm out of quicker.
Speaker 5: I suppose, right as well And then just conclude on that with the mobile processe s and spreadsheets Like I said, the departmentists have one or two You go out to other ones, but there is too many goin g around, I suppose, for [TIME-2] getting this job easier .
Speaker 5: And the desire to hide comes is to have that source of truth for all teams within the business and to actually take that Pipeline function that you have living in a moment, moving that over into [ORG-1].
Speaker 5: And then from reporting perspective, relivers the reporting capabilities of [ORG-1], as well as those dashboards and visualization aspect, and make [ORG-1] kind of for your living and breathing as a team on a day to day basis, and rather just to view only options the way you have at the moment.
Speaker 5: And then, for everyone I suppose, or find out, everyone is going to settle for success, and I'm going to cross the business.
Speaker 5: You have that source of truth on that trusted platform for the information that you have access to in [DATE-4]. But also the information that you're providing to your investors on an ongoing basis.
Speaker 5: Is there any questions on that?
Speaker 5: We're just, I was looking back about covered everything so far.
EndUser: No, not on my end.
Speaker 5: Perfect. And this is a very sorry, I do have a wide ground service business. Choose [ORG-1] and speed and agility scale as a road innovation.
Speaker 5: So firstly, The ease of custom lines that you're working with myself and you're working or with [ORG-1] and with Future 4 to create that platform for you guys that you have access to [ORG-1].
Speaker 5: But how do you make that better?
Speaker 5: How do you make it along with your business structure?
Speaker 5: And with that ease of customization, how do we reflect on the cycle that you guys have but on the investment side, on the fundraising side?
Speaker 5: Scale is e-road, which is really important for you guys as a business, but also it's primarily my job of how to reset you up for success now, but also how does it align with your company vision down the line, whether that's in 25. one's time and to show you that are the possible.
Speaker 5: And the continuous evolution with sales force , Innovation that we do have, there's three releases a year.
Speaker 5: Sometimes you don't even [PERSON-5] w these releases are happening, but it means that we're listening to the feedback from our customer s ensuring that you are getting those upgrades on a consistent basis that where you have that [ORG-3] and where it leads into the problems that you guys have.
Speaker 5: And o n Sorry, and then sorry the focus on customer success on the large ecosystem. There's a lot of applications we have on our offshore that you can see that work with your business structure.
Speaker 5: They integrate seem to see with [ORG-1]. So there's a lot of options that we can do, but going back to my main point, it's highly scale as you grow.
Speaker 5: How do we look at what your issues are now?
Speaker 5: But how do we make this a system fit for as you continue to grow in [DATE-5]?
Speaker 5: [PERSON-6], and then I'll hand over to [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-7] for the demo.
Speaker 5: Nice.
Agent: So thank you everyone.
Agent: First thing I'll do is take you through some slides giving an overview of the sort of processes we're going to be covering in the demo and then take you through [ORG-1] itself so you get a sense of how it could work for you.
Agent: So let me share my screen.
Agent: Hopefully you can all see this. Yeah, excellent.
Agent: So for those of you who don't remember from the first time we came in, what we've put together is a set of prebuilt customizations that sit on top of standard [ORG-2] cloud or salesforce.
Agent: And that brings the benefit of [DATE-6] of experience we've had working with multiple different firms within. your sector or similar sectors to really help you get the most from your salesforce investment.
Agent: So at its core, the main thing is the data model and structure for you to be able to capture the information you need about all of the different relationships you need to manage.
Agent: So potentially households, investors, LPs, sales providers, companies, potentially projects as well, contacts and then employees and potentially an expert services list. You can also then start, we then start getting into deal flow.
Agent: So the end-to-end process, the teams related to it, key contacts and potentially different investment committees. And then fundraising, again, similar we make use of [ORG-1]'s Pipeline capability to manage fundraising within [ORG-1].
Agent: And then you have fundraising teams and fundraising contacts. And then we've put together a structure that allows you to manage a fund. or multiple funds depending on how you want to, how many funds you've got in progress.
Agent: And then depending on your exact needs, we may have different related records for multiple closes or there's a variety of different ways we can link the data together.
Agent: But the core thing is, or the core thing to understand is we built an efficient and clean data model that gives you the full visibility, whether you're coming at it from an individual perspective, a company perspective or from a product or fund perspective as well.
Agent: And that's all joined nicely together into a set of predefined fundraising and deal dashboards.
Agent: When we get to those dashboards we use those as a starter and then we help you customize them for your specific set of KPI so you're looking to track.
Agent: And then on top of that, we'll train you in creating your own wants moving forward. So you don't need to come back to us to make those changes.
Agent: You should be empowered to make the changes directly on the platform itself. Okay.
Agent: So fundraising lifecycle from a [ORG-1] perspective. So a lead, and this is not always needed because you may already know all of the people that you're potentially looking for funds from.
Agent: If you don't, if you don't, or they appear via a thorough of some sort, you would qualify them. They convert into a potential investor with a related fundraising opportunity.
Agent: And we use that fundraising opportunity to manage the process through to getting a commitment from that investor and at that point they flip over from being a potential to being an active investor with a related commitment record and then if you do follow further Fund raises in the future you can use the previous fundraising opportunities to identify Potential targets for a future fundraise and then you track those as discrete fundraising records themselves I'm
Speaker 5: Already worth pointing out as well as a fundamental difference between this model and how the guys are using it now is that you are essentially linking the spreadsheet that made it shows last time.
Speaker 5: Older fundraising opportunities which are currently lines on a spreadsheet now become objects and sales force related to the contacts you have in [ORG-1]. So that's kind of dividing us [TIME-3].
Speaker 5: We replace this spreadsheet with the fundraising opportunity objects.
Agent: And you get all the the excellent stuff underneath it from [ORG-1] around [PERSON-8] insights and so on that starts to look at your data that you're entering the activities that you're logging and then starts to.
Agent: Look at these fundraising opportunities and make suggestions about whether it thinks it's likely to close or convert to a commitment based upon similar opportunities that it's seen go through or similar interactions that have taken place.
Agent: So there's lots of bits and pieces you get through investing in the [ORG-1] capabilities that you don't get from the sort of a platform-based model. So that's the fundraising side of things.
Agent: For the investment lifecycle, there is similar journey that you go through. But a lead would be an investment opportunity that requires qualification.
Agent: Again, this might be referred in from some of you already know, somebody that you've invested in previously.
Agent: It may be that you have an outbound team that's scouring around and trying to find potential investments or it could be the people are submitting details via an email or a form or it could be a whole variety of different processes or sorry, different entry points.
Agent: But what we see as a lead is then qualified and then once you've had a conversation with them to make sure that there is an alignment between where they are in their life cycle, where they are in their journey, and where you are, and whether it's the right type of investment for you or right type investment for them.
Agent: If it is, then they convert into what we call a target company with a related deal record, and then we use the deal to manage them through to becoming a portfolio company.
Agent: So in some scenarios as well, it might just be an investment in a certain site series A fundraise for that company, or you may be acquiring a part of it.
Agent: So there may be further follow-on deals that you could use to manage investments into that company. And then underpinning all of this will be the activity and emails and notes are stand within [ORG-1].
Agent: So everything, every email could be automatically synchronized into [ORG-1] or quite often within your sector, people will choose to manually associate emails with [ORG-1] rather than having them all go in. That's completely fine.
Agent: It's very much a business choice. You can log activities and follow-ups and record notes against some of these interactions you have as well.
Agent: Ok. Any questions before I go into the demo?
Agent: Thanks. OK. So this is the [ORG-1] homepage. When you log in, so I'm logged in as an overall user that has a combination of, that's the right way to describe it, has a combination of fundraising.
Agent: It's on the investor relation side, but it's also on the investment side. So you'll see across the top, there's a series of different tabs which store data, or different types of data.
Agent: So leads and referrals I've described already, accounts away we store.
Agent: Investors and portfolio companies contacts with the individuals related to it, product s are where your funds will sit and then fundraising is th e It should be obvious is a list of the fundraising opportunities, investment opportunities as well.
Agent: So each user would have their own type of home page. So the investor relations team would have a different home page and the deal team would have their own home page as well.
Agent: And potentially you can completely separate the two sides of the business. So the fundraising team, a best relation team would never know anything about the investment team and vice versa.
Agent: Or you could have more of an open model entirely again, a business decision for you to make. But you'll see on the left-hand side, there's a couple of dashboards.
Agent: One is the fundraising dashboard, and then we have one which is the deal flow dashboard as well, which should refresh. Yeah, so both of these are surfacing different types of data.
Agent: But the first part I'll go through is on the deal side, that's okay, and show you how we would create a new investment lead via or from our firm within Outlook. or within [ORG-4]. So we use [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: You'll see on the right hand side, hopefully the resolution is OK. There's a [ORG-1] side panel. Now this [ORG-1] side panel is exactly the same with an outlook as it is within [PRODUCT-3]. There's no difference at all.
Agent: Are you on [ORG-5] or are you on [ORG-6]?
EndUser: [ORG-6].
Agent: Yeah, so that the side panel appears to be exactly the same. So this is an email we've received in from somebody about a real estate investment opportunity.
Agent: On the right hand side you see the [ORG-1] panel and it's found somebody, so it's found me that doesn't exist at the moment.
Agent: What I'm going to do is create a new lead if you remember from the journey through, so it starts with the lead. So this is real estate [GPE-1]. So they're in real estate, interesting. institution accommodation.
Agent: You can see it's called in my name, details from the email.
Agent: It hasn't been in the phone, but if I wanted to put in the estimated real size and revenue, and if it's come from a third party, so there's a referral that we're working with, I can put their details in there and then when I press save.
Agent: I know just I've got a typo at the top. What this is going to do is now create a record in [ORG-1]. That way. And then I can log the email directly in as well.
Agent: So if I press log now.
Speaker 6: Sorry if I interrupt was a quick question and this template on the right that can be customized I guess.
Agent: As in what fields appear on.
Speaker 6: Here, yeah for the leads.
Agent: Oh, yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah,
Agent: Yeah. This is what a, what we call a global action in [ORG-1]. So if I go over to the [ORG-1] homepage, go to leads and referrals. There's the record that we've just created.
Agent: Go to activities and you will see. It should show the email. So there's the email that's been assigned or linked into [ORG-1]. And if I click on the attachment, I'd be able to download the attachment as well. OK.
Agent: The global action I was referring to is also available up here. So I can create a new lead. And it's going to show me those same fields, like estimated deal size and so on.
Agent: But the key question is understanding what amount of detail you want to capture at this stage to help you qualify. investment opportunity.
Agent: Do you have a clear gateway of qualification for moving on?
EndUser: Hi, usually we have like a summary of the deal we have with our outlook template basically that can be used to summarize the key aspects of the deal and if it's a new referral source, a new sponsor for us then we like to also give maybe a quick kind of a parameter on them.
EndUser: So we have custom headway fields in sales, because maybe we rate that kind of that sponsor and we assign them a geography and a lead person from headway.
Agent: Okay. Yeah. So we have a very simple path we would take you through. So there's across the top of the, um, each record, you'll see what we have something called guidance for success that takes you through that process.
Agent: Um, so it, and it can tell you what you need to do at each stage. But the idea is very simply you would go, um, have a call with myself, which sounds a bit odd. Definitely interesting.
Agent: Move to the next stage. Save. And then what I'm going to do is convert this over into those three records I had on the screen. So we're going to create a new account.
Agent: It's a type of target for failure company. We're going to create a new contact and we're going to create a new investment flow opportunity. So, FY25. Or
Agent: We could link it to an existing one, but in this scenario, we're going to create those three records.
Agent: Again, it's also Going through this process means that it's you're creating three records more quickly than you would do if you had to Sorry from one record you're creating three records rather than to create three and then relate them all together And it's ensuring the data consistency all the way through as well I
Agent: Think it's also good to
Speaker 5: Point out here is that when some of the points we made [DATE-3] that If you're going through their emails, probably look back at the previous communication, what's the update?
Speaker 5: Now you have all that activities being captured. This is your source of truth on the right-hand side. So immediately you have meetings with different investor relations.
Speaker 5: You're able to go here and see how things have been recapped, what's happened so far, whether it's from yourself or previous employees within the business.
Agent: So now here's the talk.
Speaker 6: One other question. I saw that in one of the...
EndUser: Templates, I was realizing the attachment was actually then a linked and therefore is in sales force.
EndUser: I guess my question is we get a lot of emails if we link everything including attachments to sales force is they eventually a size issue limitation.
Agent: Depends how many the size of the attachments, the records go into one place in [ORG-1] and then attachments go into a different part, I believe, it's my understanding, it's unlikely that you'd get towards your limits, I would suggest.
Agent: Um, emails,
Speaker 6: What are these limits?
Speaker 6: They're in terabytes,
Speaker 5: I think, for multiple check dollars. It's very rare, like some partners for, let's say high value more with brokers where they're uploading a lot of very high like. density files against an ongoing placement [DATE-7].
Speaker 5: Someone's running into those issues, but it's very rare. And the other thing you can do is you can just move your, you can link here your, whatever you use for your file storage name to [ORG-1].
Speaker 5: So you've actually challenged how to link to [ORG-1], how to link them to your [FAC-1] or your [ORG-7] or whatever else.
Agent: To [ORG-1], making
Agent: So they don't actually have
Speaker 5: To live in [ORG-1]. They can just be linked to [ORG-1].
Agent: Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's like 63 or something. kilobytes, maybe, for a record in [ORG-1]. And you get gigabytes per user. So I wouldn't expect it to hit a limitation in that way. OK.
Agent: So this is the [ORG-1], which is the target portfolio company record, probably a lot of the fields will be similar to ones that you have.
Agent: I think the key thing from seeing some of the the demo walkthrough [DATE-3] was around some of the structure and relationships that exist.
Agent: So if I go to the relationships tab, you'll see we've got a related contact, so that's [PERSON-9], myself. So you can add multiple people to this view.
Agent: So it could be you've got [PERSON-9], but then you can also add the accountant, lawyer, any other third parties that are related to this particular portfolio company.
Agent: And I think that would definitely give you a lot more sophisticated reporting than you have at the current model. The other model is the other area is around the accounting structure.
Agent: So being able to add multiple people to a particular account. So if I add [PERSON-10] and I have [PERSON-8], you can then assign them a role. So it's investment team and partner.
Agent: So the beauty of this approach is you can add all these people to this account. When you add somebody to the account, that can also then give them visibility to the record.
Agent: So you can control access based upon this. But then also when [PERSON-8] logs in or [PERSON-10], that's who I am, logs in.
Agent: They can have a list view or report that says, show me all of the accounts where I'm on the account team, not just where I'm the owner of the record.
Agent: So it broadens out the concept because we often find there's a lot of debate and discussion around the ownership of records, whereas this model, you can have lots of different people associated to it and indicate their role related to this particular account.
Agent: Then that also flows down to investments as well. So here's the deal record that we created
Agent: And open this up and you'll see we've got that same path across the top so the guidance for success as in our standard stages we have for investment opportunities goes from evaluating through to partner meeting due diligence term sheet drafting legal documents and then committed.
Agent: We can customize these stages for you very easily but the key thing is understanding what each of them mean to you.
Agent: Are they meaningful?
Agent: Are they discrete?
Agent: And is it clear what it means to transition from one stage to the next and what actions need to happen?
Agent: So clients change them, you would generally recommend not having more than six or seven.
Agent: If you start to get to eight, nine or ten, then the split between a stage starts to get a bit blurred and people aren't exactly clear on what it means.
Agent: So you'll see we've got in the middle the details about this particular opportunity.
Agent: It's not currently related to a fund, but I will add it and link it to fund one at this If there's a service provider involved, I would maybe add them here.
Agent: So we add in with this, if there was a sponsoring partner, that was [PERSON-8], I believe, and primary contact is me, and next step is me with [PERSON-3] and exactly.
Agent: So you should see, yeah, it's added me twice as a bug there. But yeah, you'd see contact roles. You'd see all of the people outside of your organization that are related to this particular investment opportunity.
Agent: And then the coverage team, you'll see at the moment, it's just [PERSON-10], but I can also add in the partner or whoever else it might be.
Agent: So there's [PERSON-8], pulled it down from the account record onto the opportunity record.
Agent: And as [PERSON-14] said, you can either store your files directly in [ORG-1] or because we're a [ORG-5] Apps company, we use a product called [ORG-8] that allows us to associate a file or a folder in [FAC-2] with a record in [ORG-1].
Agent: You can do exactly the same with [ORG-7] as well. So you'd have a similar component here that would serve this up data from [ORG-7] into [ORG-1] as if it was being stored in [ORG-1]. Use SharePoint online.
EndUser: Yeah, we use [ORG-7] a lot as well. OK.
Agent: You'll also see on the right-hand side that the activity that we originally logged when this was a lead has been brought over, associated to the opportunity.
Agent: This activity then rolls up to each of the individuals that are on the contact team. Sorry, the contact roles, but then also roles up the account level as well. So you can see it at all those different levels.
Speaker 6: So this says,
EndUser: It's called link with iLevel. What I'm thinking is if we use [ORG-1] basically for pipeline, we put in some target, some investments. And eventually, if we do the investment, it would land for us in a high level.
Agent: Yeah. Can we infer I'll need to check on the integration.
Speaker 6: The data?
Agent: It's come up a few times, but I don't know whether we've actually been able to. I don't know if anyone's actually integrated with it. I will check for you.
Speaker 7: Think forward just on that point. That could be part of the investment closing process. I suppose, handing that over to the team, I suppose it would be [PERSON-2] that manages more so on the eye level side.
Speaker 7: But I think usually firms will use some kind of Enterprise data management solution that ties everything together rather than necessarily a direct [ORG-9] between eye level and sales force.
Speaker 8: I level doesn't capture any communication, right?
Speaker 7: Any emails, not that it's just the that's that's [ORG-1].
Speaker 8: Yeah.
Agent: So I was just going to show you now another thing that comes with this version of [ORG-1] is something called action plans and document checklists. So an action plan is a predefined set of tasks.
Agent: That you need to complete as part of a business process. So this one is called investment first check, so investment review. And it's very much within your control as to what goes into each of these items.
Agent: So if I press next, you'll see here are the four activities that need tasks that need to be done. And here are the three documents that need to be created and essentially who needs to create them.
Agent: So the tasks you see either can be assigned to an individual, so because I'm the person who created this action plan, they're all going to be from me. But I could have also assigned into a queue.
Agent: So to say if there's an investment review team queue, you could send them all to that group. Or they could be assigned to a specific individual.
Agent: If there's somebody that always does the financial analysis, you would assign them to them. So I press save, you may now see an action plan appear on the right hand side.
Agent: Here are the tasks with the prerequisites and here are the documents that need to be uploaded.
Agent: So each of the documents as well has a review process so you can upload the document, submit it for review and then come back as well.
Agent: So those all these documents will be linked to the investment opportunity and you can see one of these tasks has a dependency on another one so we can't prepare the slides until we've done the business analysis.
Agent: So you can see this task is status of waiting and it won't get activated and won't appear in the activity list view until business analysis is completed. So if you want to change any of these action plan attributes.
Agent: You'll go to a action plan template and we'll clone a new one.
Agent: [DATE-8]. March I'll save it. And then it's going to give me the option to add new tasks or add new documents that are required as part of this. And these action plan templates can be assigned to leads.
Agent: They can be assigned to accounts, contacts, and also fundraising and investment opportunities as well.
Agent: So if you have a checklist in a Word doc or a wiki or something else, they're easy to transfer this over into a sales force and then everyone has. visibility of where . you are in the process. So,
Agent: Say this is required, we'll give it normal priority and say we can't do this until the slides are ready and we've checked the industry. This is where we decide who it's going to be assigned to.
Agent: Or the role or the person that creates it or a queue. So there might be a queue of people that prepare these slides or present them.
Agent: So over there, someone's going to put it down as a specific user and say it's going to be [PERSON-8].
Agent: You can also sign a reminder so people will get an automated email or they'll get an alert on their mobile app. So give it [DATE-9].
Speaker 7: [PERSON-8], would there be a way to add a task as part of logging an interaction?
Speaker 7: So if you've just had a call, you know the interactions take in place and you know they will be an associate to follow up.
Speaker 7: Can you lock that as part of logging the interaction?
Agent: As in... log a call with a follow-up.
Speaker 7: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Agent: Yes, I don't know if that's standard sales force anymore. Give me a second to check, but we do have it ourselves. We're on the activity page.
Speaker 7: Log
Agent: A call. There is a follow-up section that you type in the details and then it will automatically create a follow-on activity. Let me just show you. So this one's now published. If I go back to the previous record.
Agent: Where is it?
Agent: There we go. So now there's the action plan you can see on the right hand side with the status in progress and the percentage complete as well.
Agent: And those tasks would appear, if I go back to my home page, they would appear in, if they're assigned to happen [DATE-2], they would appear in my [DATE-2]'s task on my home page.
Agent: They would also appear on the tasks tab where I can see all of my tasks, either ones that have been assigned to me or ones that I've assigned to other people. You can filter this out, however you like.
Agent: If I've opened tasks, there's going to be a lot of consuming. Yeah. Here's all my tasks that I need to complete. If I wanted to go back to your question about logging a call with a follow-up.
Agent: Log a call.
Agent: No, it's not in here, but we have in our own internal self-force, we have a couple of custom fields that are follow-up called date, follow-up with object and comments, and then when you press save here, it creates a new [ORG-1] activity with that follow-up date.
Speaker 7: Thank you. You have the new items as
Speaker 5: Well as the last time you're having those next step kind of actions you might be living in your outlook. So emailing the client and that's going to be logged automatically and within the outlook panel, the Barnage will start.
Speaker 5: You can create a task or a reminder within there as well. So you can say write them, email the client [DATE-2]. So I need the documents.
Speaker 5: I'll pull in a reminder maybe our task for someone to call it [DATE-10]. Exactly.
Speaker 7: Good to know. Thank you.
Agent: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, okay. So that was, sorry, it was a question.
EndUser: Yeah, just a quick one on my end.
EndUser: Once you have, let's say, many deals in there, is there kind of a list view that you can see and that you can edit?
Agent: Yeah, so this is the standard list view to show me all open investment opportunities.
Agent: You could have, you can see, Some of these are linked to Fund 1, some of them are linked to a Series A Fund raise and so on, because we've got multiple products within our demonstration.
Agent: And for each of these, yes, you can come in and make edits on them. There's a couple of ways of then where we run it internally is you can have a split view.
Agent: So this is to show me all of the investment opportunities. And then I can update them directly in the record. Here, this is one way of doing it.
Agent: Or I can switch to a camban view which may take [TIME-4] to load, because there are a number of records that are in there, and what this is do is literally present the set of cards in a camban view for all the open investment opportunities.
Agent: So there we go.
Speaker 5: And this party essentially replaces the media spreadsheet that we looked at [DATE-8]. This is kind of I'd rather not have an updated visual field on a spreadsheet.
Speaker 5: I mean, like [DATE-14], it's going to work with the team and it's all the records are in place. And then as they move to the stages, they move along the boards. And then with the need so.
Speaker 5: So you're not trying to keep, like the trick of spread, it's over how to keep the history of what's happened, you know, what's the history of that deal has a got that point.
Speaker 5: Everything will be saved here in this one place you'll see the history on the activity, see the history on when I moved to the stages you'll see the history on what task we're assigning his to do.
Speaker 5: So kind of replacing this spreadsheet essentially.
Speaker 8: Yeah, that's great. All I'd say is the volume of investors is pretty high.
Speaker 8: But how are they ranked here?
Speaker 8: Can I decide what they're ranked by?
Speaker 8: I mean, what I'm just looking at these at the stage at the top?
Speaker 8: Yeah, I mean, I could have a few hundred right in each one.
Agent: Is this for fundraising or for?
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 8: Yep.
Agent: So my spreadsheet
Speaker 8: Currently has like [DATE-8] names in it. I need to whittle that down. There's only really a few hundred that. Really strong prospects that we have regular dialogue with. We look at [PERSON-18],
Speaker 5: Like, you know, how you do this. That's maybe my strong prospects or look at the same little Yeah.
Agent: So this is showing me all fundraising. with all stages, but we can create filters of, I don't know if we've got any where it's. So we may filter down to just look at fund one fundraising.
Agent: And then as [PERSON-14] was saying, we can also apply other filters.
Speaker 8: Is this actually our information or is this?
Agent: No, this is dummy data, don't worry.
Speaker 8: Yeah, I was like, because some of these things are familiar.
Speaker 8: I was like, what is that?
Speaker 8: Okay.
Agent: Yeah, so you can also all of the fields that are available in [ORG-1] on this one, particularly you can filter down by, I think we've got to have tier. So you can say top tier investors.
Speaker 8: Yeah. Those
Agent: In a filter list view, or I want to see by, I'm going to keep scrolling and find that we don't have tier.
Agent: Yeah, you can filter based upon that and you can also filter some of our clients will add a hot warm cold.
Speaker 8: Or by value
Speaker 5: Or by [DATE-8], you know, investment quarter.
Speaker 5: Is it [DATE-18] is it [DATE-17]?
Speaker 5: Is it fun?
Speaker 5: One, one, a pay-by-table.
Speaker 8: Two, I mean, it's pretty much
Speaker 5: And it's freshly but easier because you can just turn the mind off and quickly on any field you have. You can quickly build your list and get the mix of views.
Speaker 8: No, brilliant. That's really helpful and it's all really good. And I know that you're talking about the deal side before, but obviously there were parallels with fundraising. I can see how I certain things there.
Speaker 6: Actually apply
Speaker 8: Sorry.
Agent: So
EndUser: Two questions. So on the fundraising data, can we also give it a weighting the amounts so that we say, oh, an early stage investor has a likelihood.
EndUser: So over 90 million commitment, we would expect to get 10 million we can slice and dice the data where we are in fundraising.
Agent: So that
Agent: Yeah, so what we do is each stage in on a on an opportunity has a probability percentage or default probability assigned to it. And what we do to start with is we've got a standard set.
Agent: But what you'll do after a period of time of going through is you'll be able to update probability waiting based upon actual data. So the probability means [PERCENT-1] or it's [PERCENT-1] at interest stage.
Agent: That means that [PERCENT-1] of the opportunities in your [PRODUCT-4] that get to interest stage will actually convert through to committed. So what we do is we multiply the probability by the amount.
Speaker 8: Okay. Yeah.
Agent: And then we give you the expected amount. And so, and we have a minimum target and a maximum target.
Agent: And then that calculates the, or the average is then put into the standard sales force amount field, we apply the expected amount.
Speaker 8: So
Agent: The benefit of this is then you can say, right, I need to sack my Pipeline with. billion at stage two two get through to a billion total commitment target.
EndUser: And my other question on the deal Pipeline table overview, can we get if the opportunities rating so that we can rank them by priority?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Yep. In the same anything you can do on the opportunity side on the fundraising side, you can also do on the investment side.
Agent: So again, the investment probability would be default defined by the stage you are in the process or you can have your own.
Speaker 6: Yeah, but I don't mean like the percentages we discussed for the fundraising but what we do in [PRODUCT-4] is basically deals we rank as one are the ones that are likely to close the tools are the very advanced ones so that we can rank them in our Pipeline discussion and focus on the most advanced deals which might change over time.
Agent: Yep. Yep. Absolutely.
Speaker 7: Yep. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to start with the stroke.
Agent: Yeah. You can add. So you can add any attributes you want to the, um, the deal record, or it could be at the, um, the company level or. Yeah.
Agent: If it, if you need it to segment your focus in a particular area, then yes, absolutely. Yeah. Um, so this is the fundraising. So this is, uh, the. product. So fund one is the product.
Agent: It's in it has its own life cycle again. So pre launch capital raise, closing investment or active. You can store attributes related to this fund.
Agent: So the description, the target fund raise, first closing, multiple closing gates and then the financial summary.
Speaker 8: And you'll see this
Agent: Is that committed plus weighted [PRODUCT-4] versus target.
Agent: So our target, I admit the data is incorrect but the target is 555 million but based upon the weighted Pipeline we're not going to hit that target and the weighted [PRODUCT-4] is all of these related fundraising opportunities down here by weighted by where they are in the [PRODUCT-4] process.
Speaker 8: I can confirm that's not correct. Yeah, just a couple of things. So I think to your point earlier on the fundraising side, at least the task element is really critical.
Speaker 8: So pretty much every investor call that we have will always try and line up at the next step, whatever that is, even if it looks like they're a longer prospect, it's probably similar.
Agent: Anyone who sells
Speaker 8: Is similar. So I think that's going to be an integral part of the platform for me is being able to very quickly see what those tasks are.
Agent: And
Speaker 8: The various sidebars that you showed I mean, I can imagine that will probably be my [WORK_OF_ART-1] I'll have that open 30 seven and just follow that I also do send a lot of attachment s like latest presentations and so on So just it sounds like that That won't be an issue in terms of storage
Agent: No, so we within our own [ORG-1] we use a document generation tool So if I'm sending out a private equity proposal , I will go to the company record and I'll press generate slides and it generates a slide with your details merged into it that I can then send out from [ORG-1].
Agent: There's lots of, we try it. It's not just simplifying the process.
Agent: It's also ensuring you're not, I mean, I used to always go back to find an old version of a set of slides, copy and paste it and send it out.
Agent: This means that a central place for you to store those templates that then can be used consistently.
Speaker 8: I saw the presentation on the [ORG-1], on the platform.
Agent: You store it within a document generation tool on the platform and then you press a button document and generate the slides and then off you go.
Speaker 8: To just generate the
Speaker 8: Oh wow, so the moment is always shared on [ORG-7], a platform we have which is actually a bit of a nightmare and I typically have to save the PDF to my desktop.
Agent: Which is
Agent: Can
Speaker 8: This platform watermark documents?
Agent: I need to check. It depends what document is. That part's more around the document generation tool. So would use the tool to generate the document.
Speaker 8: You
Agent: We would then save it into [ORG-7] online and then you can send it from within [ORG-1]. So one of those tools would Yeah, need it.
Speaker 8: Interesting. that sounds, I'd love to learn more about that in time. And the other thing is you don't have any, it's not in any way interactive with the data room.
Speaker 8: So it'd be amazing if I could check with an investor and then if I... set up Datamax as I perhaps log it in here.
Speaker 8: I do a tick box to say Datamax is granted on [ORG-10] then maybe I can see if they've downloaded anything from the [GPE-2] .
Agent: And
Agent: Absolutely. There's, we don't have time to show it to you now.
Agent: We're about to start a project with another priority firm [DATE-17] and we've done a couple already where you use something called Salesforce Experience Cloud which you can expose out a version of this product record your investors and any files associated to it they would be able to see as well and then you can track whether anyone's actually looked at the [ORG-8] whether they've downloaded interesting.
Speaker 8: For
Speaker 8: It. That's what's really as well, and that's
Agent: Fully branded within your branding. It looks like your website, and you have complete control over who's looking at what or not.
Speaker 8: So it's almost like a data room, separate data room, who's hosting it?
Speaker 8: Who's
Agent: Hosting it?
Agent: The [ORG-1] can also expose out the [ORG-7] online folders that you have. So if you say, if you have a folder, you can share that out with your investors, but it's within the [ORG-1] branded awful effectively.
Speaker 8: And you can put like an [ORG-14] in place, etc.
Agent: You automatically generate an [ORG-14] from within [ORG-1] based upon details that you've got.
Speaker 8: Can also
Agent: So we use it again internally, we do a company's house check to get all their details, then we press a button that generates the [ORG-14], sends it out by a docu sign, it gets signed, comes back in, And then it updates the record to say an [ORG-14] has been signed and then you can give them access to a portal.
Speaker 8: That's very cool. Because you currently use [ORG-8], but you would completely replace that. Although it's [PERSON-2] on this call. I forget. Next. The investor portal that we have.
Speaker 8: So we obviously have a we use power line for both fundraising, fundraising portal, and then we have an investor portal, where capital course distributions, etc. are logged.
Agent: So I'm
Speaker 8: Just thinking if we can't do that through [ORG-1], which I don't think would make sense. It might be. be a bit clunky to then have two data room, two accesses . I
Agent: Don't know. You could do capital calls, manage capital call process within [ORG-1] and whether you actually send the message out from [ORG-1] or not. I haven't done that for [DATE-18] to be honest. So definitely feasible.
Agent: The other part of the whistle stop through the rest of it is campaign. So you can use [ORG-1] campaigns to do an initial outbound email blast. You can do road shows.
Agent: You can track all of those campaigns and say the email generated [PERCENT-2] of the interest. The road show generated another [PERCENT-3].
Agent: You can do different attribution models based upon your goal, whether it's outbound calling, emails, road shows, whatever it might be. So that's on the fundraising side. Then investments, they're all tied up to the product as well.
Agent: And then you can also start tracking product investment performance. So fund one versus an index. And then if I quickly jump over to the two other things to show you.
Agent: Oh, I need to show your portfolio company and also dashboard. So this is an investment dashboard.
Agent: So target total investment where we are in the funnel, [PRODUCT-4] progress over time, and then investment by [ORG-8] and strategies, investment by account. The other one is the fundraising dashboard, which is definitely a bit more colourful.
Agent: You've got fundraising funnel, weighted fundraising over time, the largest opportunities, and then fundraising by stage by investor. So you can see we've got this set up stage two, this set at stage three.
Agent: I've wanted to drill into particular stage and look at who is at that stage and what the fundraising opportunities are. Here's that underlying report with all of the opportunities and the companies and the closed dates and so on.
Agent: And from here click another and then I'm into the specific details of that fundraising record.
Agent: And then on the portfolio company side, let me just show you
EndUser: A man jump in with a bit of a random question.
EndUser: The how I organize my fundraising spreadsheet is I track not only potential investors, but potential private equity managers, we work with by region for [GPE-3], for example, because [GPE-3] is much more decentralized than, for example, the [GPE-4], where everything is
Agent: In [GPE-1].
Speaker 6: So what I want to see in my spreadsheet, exos spreadsheet, currently, is if I go to the [GPE-5] area in [GPE-3], show me all the GPS and LPs I can visit basically in [QUANTITY-1] from [GPE-5], which includes other bigger cities.
Speaker 6: Is sales for smart enough to give me that information?
Speaker 6: Or would we need to put in like, define certain areas within [GPE-3] to say, OK, this is the area 2, and I define it?
Speaker 6: What can I just say?
Speaker 6: Like something like in [QUANTITY-2] radius from [GPE-5].
Agent: Give me all the Yeah.
EndUser: Context we have.
Agent: Thanks, everyone. I'm hoping this is going to work. There's a product called Salesforce Maps that looks at the data you've got on your accounts.
Agent: Count records and then we'll surface up or show you a whole load of Data and what we then apply what we call layers on top of it, which are very easy for you to Hopefully this is going to bring me back some data The easy for you to then change and say right I want the radial distance of this layer to be [QUANTITY-3] from [QUANTITY-4] from this particular location So you can see here's all the account records that there's hundreds of them because of the data we've got in there.
Agent: If I go down to one of them, I can look at the details associated to each one of these. And then from here, I can plan out a schedule or plan out a route I'm going to take.
Agent: So the scenario here is I'm in [GPE-5] for [DATE-17]. I've met somebody in the morning. I've got a free afternoon.
Agent: Who should I go and meet and who can I go and meet?
Agent: Add to root and then off I go. And you can serve these. These are just, they're not colored by anything, but you could have, you can do what you call the things where the different size of the hotspot.
Agent: [DATE-16] ones or [DATE-17].
Speaker 5: Two coded
Agent: Yeah, exactly. I can be color or sized based upon [ORG-18] or interest or whether they've got open fundraising opportunities or anything else as well. Absolutely.
Speaker 6: And do we have to pay always extra for these overlayers like the Salesforce Maps and then the
Agent: The salesforce maps, it's an add-on, but it's only not everyone has to have [ORG-1] maps. So it's only the people that are out and about that potentially need it.
Speaker 8: And if one of us has it, I assume we could work out. Because this is the roadshow planning that you were just still referring to this.
Agent: No, the rocho planning was where you're co-hosting a series of investors coming into a hotel or something to meet or an office to meet with a target company and talking about the proposition.
Speaker 5: Well, you could have a rocho called if you just pick one of them there, [PERSON-17], you know, I had to campaign it from the option.
Speaker 5: So you could have one called [FAC-3] in [DATE-25], for be to campaign and that campaign you add them to is the [GPE-5] Roadshow.
Speaker 8: Example. Yeah, because it's not true. And what you're asking is could
Speaker 5: So what you could do older because you're planning is.
Speaker 5: I'm going over there [DATE-17] a cross [DATE-10] Look at your map Look at your list You are going to see all thes e tier ones and tier two's .
Speaker 8: I'm trying to see, you know I was making
Speaker 5: Add those 18 accounts to a campaign, a roadshow, and then if you can then associate all your activities with that company in terms of like maybe a massive email to as many people in those in those 17 accounts as you can.
Speaker 5: See your response, get them all scheduled in, create your task reminders so that's kind of how it would all do together I suppose.
Speaker 8: Yeah, we typically don't send mass emails, but normally at least on the investor side, it's always bespoke.
Speaker 8: But definitely, in terms of road shows, it will be a case if I were going to claim or anyone on the fundraising side say, I'm going to wherever [GPE-6], sometimes it's new regions, [GPE-7], be me.
Agent: It'll
Speaker 8: And so that's where I think that when you said road show campaign, could be that was that was great.
Agent: Oh, yeah, definitely
Speaker 8: Yeah, but there are instances separate campaigns like we send out a [DATE-25] newsletter.
Agent: Which would
Speaker 8: Be good for this.
Speaker 8: When we have our investor meeting, for example, we email all of our investor contacts for the various funds, but also they need to be bespoke Those emails because obviously some investors are in funds three or four, some are in four or five, some are in just five and so we need to tailor them invite they get, but once we have, once you break from categorizing investors accordingly, we can send the same email to everyone So there are instances where we do like a mass mail .
Agent: The
Agent: Yep. Something course is probably good for me to stop talking.
Speaker 8: You should survive this Okay.
Agent: I know [PERSON-17] wants to finish up on a couple of points.
Speaker 8: I've only got Yeah.
Agent: [TIME-5].
Speaker 8: Okay.
Speaker 5: Thanks so much, [PERSON-18], and thanks, [PERSON-4], and as well, I'll join again and share my screen. I think I started doing that.
Speaker 5: I think the key thing here when our income is back is you have salesforce set up at the moment. You've got a very limited version of salesforce set up. That doesn't have the fundraising deal flow, the opportunities, etc.
Speaker 5: So ultimately what you need to do is move to a different version of salesforce and a direct [ORG-17] with ourselves on either a good product, which will go to at the moment.
Speaker 5: So, we have a generic and obviously around the course [PERCENT-4] of what we show [DATE-2]. Then we have a [ORG-2] specific.
Speaker 5: The housing manager functionality and comes into some of those later releases The team kind of recommended for the kind of four state releases . Things like [PERSON-17] certainly came up [DATE-2].
Speaker 5: We kind of look at and see and prices on those and even when I thought those in our I think, can I think, correctly if I'm wrong here, [PERSON-16], the country around the moment to resell or expire sometime in [DATE-17].
Speaker 5: So you could look at, you know, if you're going to start invent this project across [DATE-30], that should be a perfect timeline that company would have [DATE-25] [DATE-17] and any kind of new sales force starts.
Speaker 5: Now you've got [DATE-30] of overlap to build a [PERSON-3] and then a slide before that country expires. You could do this on your same org. You could add in your new sales force Contract on top.
Speaker 5: Of [DATE-29] of what the day is you have . But what you have is quite messy. I know this happens a lot.
Speaker 5: What are customers that you are at a TV, especially because so much your data is in this. It's in your spreadsheet I mean to me.
Speaker 5: Tiffany, what you're better off doing is starting a fresh, getting your data from chorice, and barning and building it out with a temp that he's hot on a fresh vanilla org. taking all the data useful, great.
Speaker 8: You have. The stuff that's
Speaker 5: Get into [ORG-17] like format that could form a healthy width. And then we'll pull that up into the next new [ORG-1] in the kind of correct license products that we would have.
Speaker 5: And that will be your new [ORG-1] going forward.
Speaker 5: Is everyone kind of, I know it's a very high level summary, but is that kind of what you've had anticipated or I do thought about how you would get from your old [ORG-1] to your overarching [ORG-18] all the
Speaker 8: Records that are in the south was currently will be transferred across, right?
Speaker 8: All the notes that are in there to date or not?
Speaker 5: Yes, I know you want to keep. And that's an exercise just on a bit of scope in the future form. Have a look what you have, have a look what you want to keep.
Speaker 5: Is there a job?
Speaker 5: Very you want to keep?
Speaker 5: Or this is your nice opportunity to kind of refresh and reclaim.
Speaker 5: If there's all the fields you've captured, you want to re-populate a new field?
Speaker 5: Great. But I think the key thing is how you build out those pipelines and how you integrate your spreadsheet again. So those records into your new.
Speaker 5: Sales course in systems?
Speaker 5: Yeah, just 25
Speaker [TIME-6] on that for me. So definitely for me on the investor side, as I said, I treat the sales was currently like a library.
Speaker 8: So I definitely want access to all of that information, because it allows me to very quickly see all the past communication.
Speaker 8: But in terms of populating the new fields and using it more proactively or interactively, I'll start that from scratch.
Speaker 8: So I think as of an off-startup with all of our ones and twos and there's our higher prospects and I'll start manually uploading where and how I'm putting in the live dates to follow up and so on.
Speaker 8: But definitely all the investor communication that you've had [DATE-2], I want to be able to just see that and track. So it's just there for reference.
Speaker 5: Fine. Yeah.
Speaker 5: Probably like we kind of need a final follow-up with the future board of the end of the scope and what you want to keep versus what you don't want to keep and what the cross-circle size of business you need.
Speaker 8: Yeah, I agree.
Speaker 6: So what we need as a next step, I think, is because I'm not in the detail in a summary and the budget, what kind of license do we have now?
Speaker 6: What are the costs?
Speaker 6: And then what could be the transfer of the license, the add-ons we need potentially or considering. to take that internally to the committee to get the approval for the budget.
Speaker 5: So this will give you a brief overview of the product options based on the part you've seen [DATE-2]. You release one two kind of [PERCENT-5] of that.
Speaker 5: And then release three and four and focusing on [ORG-2] type, which aligns with kind of some of that mapping you did initially with [PERSON-3].
Speaker 5: We don't have access your Contract you have a moment that's not with salesforce that's through a resetters so that's information that you would have to seek yourself.
Speaker 5: This would be a new [ORG-17] based on prices and discounts that we can offer on our side. And so [GPE-8] wanted to its Sales Cloud is the product. So Price per user per month.
Speaker 5: So [ORG-17] is [QUANTITY-5], one from a capability side of things that reflects an everything you saw from the deal origination as well as most of the investor on the fundraising side as well as the current reporting.
Speaker 5: And then wondering if on both sides, I've included there's sale of engagement or primary success. So sales and agent is ordering that activity capture.
Speaker 5: And those best next steps with the [PRODUCT-5] features are kind of living out of, out look with that side panel of sales force included. And what we have is a close from the [ORG-2] guide.
Speaker 5: So [ORG-16] which plays back to that release pre and four of which was a big thing from that document generation piece in media that you were talking about. And kind of recent statements.
Speaker 5: Two options I wanted to show you, two list prices I wanted to show you, kind of got the understanding of what you would need from a budget perspective to move forward.
Speaker 5: But there is the element of these are these prices and there are discounts that we are able to provide to Support that growth that scaling side.
Speaker 5: And that goes back to our pricing either as opposed to the commitments for us to manage pricing with our commercial team. And this is what our [GPE-9] says from a product mix.
Speaker 5: So how many users are you looking at?
Speaker 5: Flush is the product that we're using looking at. So for example, users have been using financial services, Kite. That's when I'm here at your two users.
Speaker 5: I've seen the more users you have, the more discounting models that I have access to. Contract-to-length is also one that I would need clarification on.
Speaker 5: Most customers go for your [DATE-30] and beyond, because you invest into this product. You're getting up and running. You're working with Future Form.
Speaker 5: It's something that we continue to look at, evolve, and growing over [DATE-40] to come. And then the signature dates.
Speaker 5: We did briefly mention at the moment you have what we can see and this is probably the only thing we can see about your current contract. It's due to end in [DATE-17].
Speaker 5: We need to take into consideration those releases of what was spoken back with future for [DATE-35] period.
Speaker 5: You want enough time that you guys are part of that build part of that scoping, but also kind of having a [DATE-30] handover period of having both systems still in place for that data to move over in case you've any further questions around that.
Speaker 5: Questions. So I think all right, just to clarify, it's just, well, for us, giving the exact number, you have to just give them the amount of different levers up later.
Speaker 5: What do we get, [PERSON-17]?
Speaker 5: I think we can come back with the number pretty, pretty quickly, if you go back one side, [PERSON-17], we've given this for a high level of losing perspective at the very bottom there, you see kind of 30 to 30k based on 52. users, predictably, I'll see that the more you commit to in terms of then the Contract lowers the value, it can be a short term product, it's pretty slightly higher in value.
Speaker 5: The open and the right plant with service cloud, you probably don't need yes, and maybe not for phase one.
Speaker 5: Well, for example, some of the things we discussed [DATE-2], like document generation, you know, that's something you want to include in phase one, and that would be a reason to go for the [ORG-2] product.
Speaker 5: We can go to these in more detail in another call, but just from a budgeting perspective, I guess, is a.
Speaker 5: What you need now in the first two phases, you can cover by the left option for a singl e look is more scalable for all the releases . have a finite circuit-specific product .
Speaker 5: I think you probably need from your side to understand your current contracts. And [PERSON-16], you're doing a big, you're trying to find out exactly what is going on and when it ends and how much it costs.
Speaker 5: But hopefully that's a budget perspective. And ideally you would, depending on when you start, you would get this Contract in place once [PERSON-3] takes off the project.
Speaker 5: So we will be looking at kind of say getting a couple more scope and calls.
Speaker 5: We are being sure that but it in committee signed off in [DATE-17], do the building [DATE-25], [DATE-30] trying time so that it's all ready to Go Live in [DATE-17].
Speaker 5: I think that's a time that we need to kind of work on together. How
Speaker 5: Does that align guys with foreign travel conversations have happened on your side?
Speaker 5: I think that Okay, we'll find out about maps and we can add that into the conversation.
Speaker 6: Can work fine.
Speaker 5: I think it's 35 and or [QUANTITY-6] per user for [DATE-30]. So again, we can add that in as a product, kind of more products, mainly we can pitch it off for more discount.
Speaker 5: So the Price might be in the hope of the value, but hopefully to up as well. We will build all of that.
Speaker 5: And I think, far enough to travel, I think the key thing is to action is we could book in a little bit of that scoping, just in terms of like, one more poll of [PERSON-3] and I'm eager to see what you want to keep versus what you don't want to keep from your old system and that way, we have our else meetings found across the business.
Speaker 5: That'll help them put together a plan to the replan, but we can kind of save confidence. Here's how you got your existing sales force, into your new sales force, [PERSON-25] is going to take.
Speaker 8: Thank you. But I mean, I would also say on the deals, I assume we don't want to lose any of the information.
Speaker 8: It'd be a similar thing for the deals now, at least for the managers that we track closely.
EndUser: Yeah, and I think we would want to keep a lot of the information a bit more about clean up of how structured and feels that we don't use and stuff like that.
Speaker 8: Okay.
Agent: We would run through on a scaping call with you so that we can really get into the nitty-gritty in terms of what would be coming across into a potential new org anyway.
Agent: We would ensure that you guys were in a happy place regarding bringing your data over.
Speaker 5: That would be probably the key next step, getting in that scoping call.
Speaker 5: And then also just the question I know we mentioned [DATE-3], but do we need, is there anyone else in the business that we want to share this demo with or showcase it back to them?
Speaker 5: I think over, [PERSON-1], sorry, you related to the call.
Speaker 5: It's great to kind of finally make the introduction, but is there anyone else in the business that would like to be involved?
Speaker 6: If you could send us the, hear the recording.
Speaker 5: I think we can [PRODUCT-6].
EndUser: Circulate it.
Speaker 5: So then [PERSON-4] on your side for scoping when what's been able to be looking like?
Speaker 5: Big question,
Agent: Always. Not much time. [DATE-30] there's maybe some time, on [DATE-40] [TIME-7] [DATE-46] is the earliest availability.
Speaker 5: As in [DATE-36].
Agent: No, [DATE-40].
Speaker 5: It's [DATE-40]. Oh yeah, perfect fondies.
Speaker 5: How does that?
Speaker 5: Work for the at 25.
EndUser: [DATE-50] at [DATE-50], sorry, or 8, okay.
Agent: Or 10 works. That's fine for
Speaker 8: Me if you need me on it. That would be great.
Speaker 5: Yeah, I should
EndUser: Be able to do that as well.
EndUser: And if you can
Speaker 5: Circulate a placeholder and. But for our office already, those time lines, I know you mentioned you need high level budgets to go to [ORG-17]. When, when do you need those by.
EndUser: That
EndUser: Can be done on quite short notice we don't have fixed dates. Right. So, once we have it.
Speaker 5: I'd say shortly after that call the [PERSON-3] and then we can get some maybe [GPE-10] will link in a couple of [PERSON-16] efforts is on those levers and it's got confirmation of the different user products, maybe turbulence and if you get information under current contract, then we can get our cost locked down pretty quickly as well.
Speaker 5: Okay.
EndUser: Should I have my [DATE-17]
Speaker 5: From a cost perspective?
Speaker 5: Sounds good.
EndUser: We
Speaker 9: Are sitting down on [DATE-50] [TIME-8] for the delivery.
Speaker 9: It's available by then, that's great. It's nice at the end of the world, but truly obviously now together.
Speaker 5: So the line goes towards the afternoon. We could have a short place all around, say [DATE-30] [TIME-8], before that meeting, just to run back through the findings from [PERSON-3] side.
Speaker 5: What we deemed as gold, the findings from our side, what we deemed the overall likely Price based on the products and the levers.
Speaker 5: And then we have, you know, does that be everyone's goal?
Speaker 5: But just since there was available [DATE-30] [TIME-8]. Coach, what we have, I'll get to see everything you have for your meeting on [DATE-50], [PERSON-1]. Go ahead, thanks.
Speaker 9: Okay, thanks
Speaker 5: Guys. Bye, bye. Have a good time guys. Thank you.
EndUser: You. Thank you. Thank
Speaker 5: Bye. Thanks everyone. Bye.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current use of [PRODUCT-1] and spreadsheets. While the sales rep did discuss the manual loading and potential issues with the current setup, they could have delved deeper into the customer's pain points and specific use cases to better tailor the demo and potential solution.

2. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with other CRM systems. This would help the sales rep understand the customer's needs and preferences, as well as any potential obstacles to adopting [ORG-1].

3. The sales rep could have explored the customer's data management and storage needs in more detail. The customer expressed concern about the potential size limitations of storing attachments in [ORG-1], but the sales rep did not provide a clear answer. Addressing this concern and discussing potential solutions, such as linking to external file storage systems, could help alleviate the customer's worries.

4. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's investor relations team and their specific needs and workflows. This would help the sales rep better understand how [ORG-1] could be customized to meet the needs of the entire team, not just the investment side.

5. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's experience with data migration and any potential challenges they might face when transitioning from their current system to [ORG-1]. This would help the sales rep address any concerns and provide a smoother onboarding experience.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of using the seller's product to replace their current spreadsheet-based system for managing fundraising opportunities and investor relations. They specifically mentioned the benefits of having a single source of truth for all investor-related information, as well as the ability to track activities and interactions with investors in a more structured and organized manner. They also appreciated the ability to customize the system to fit their specific business structure and needs, as well as the potential for scalability as their business grows. The customer also showed interest in the document generation tool, which could help them maintain consistency and ensure accurate data when sending out proposals or other investor-related documents.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Based on the transcript, the customer did seem to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They showed interest in the product's capabilities, such as the data model, structure, predefined fundraising and deal dashboards, and the training provided for customizing the dashboards. They also appreciated the fundraising lifecycle process presented by the seller. However, they did mention the need to clarify some details and get a final follow-up with their team before making a final decision.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:
- ""What we've done so far, a lot needs to happen to ensure we get set up for success on [ORG-1]. Can you tell us more about that?""
- ""How do you make that better? How do you make it align with your business structure?""
- ""How do we look at what your issues are now and make this a system fit for as you continue to grow in [DATE-5]?""
- ""Is there any questions on that?""
- ""How many users are you looking at for the new [ORG-1]?""
- ""What do we get, [PERSON-17]?""
- ""Do we need, is there anyone else in the business that we want to share this demo with or showcase it back to them?""

5. The sales rep could have provided more clarity on the pricing and licensing options, including the discounts available and the benefits of committing to a longer contract. They could have also provided more details on the implementation process and what to expect in terms of data migration and system setup.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They showed interest in the seller's product and its features, asked questions about customization, scalability, and integration with their existing systems. They also mentioned that they would like to share the demo with other people in their organization. However, they did not explicitly mention their intention to proceed with the deal.

Answer to this question is unclear:
- The customer's willingness to pay or the budget for the deal
- The specific timeline for the deal closure
- Whether there are any blockers or concerns from the customer's side that might prevent the deal from being closed."
video_19780_167_6qr3y000000oimbAAA,"Agent: He's
Agent: Getting that.
Agent: I just went through the agenda.
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-1]. And so that's kind of the format that will follow within the proposal we put together.
Agent: Now pause here so we can level set again on what brought us here to this initial conversation, how the lens we view all of our projects. So [PERSON-2], do you kind of want to go over our pillars again.
Agent: [PERSON-2] and, and [PERSON-3], it's good to see you again. I. Happy to go in on the overview.
Agent: I don't know, [PERSON-4], if you want to pull up any slides for this or and I Gendes, I was waiting till you mentioned it, but I was assuming you were kind of covering the agenda to show Uh, true team what we're talking, but um, yeah Yeah, So listen, I'm happy to hit the highlights, you know, especially if some of this resonates with you, you know, but more importantly, it's one two be able to answer any questions about, you know, the company.
Agent: I have them up
Agent: It might it might be helpful if I hand gendas done here we go
Agent: You know, last time we were on, I talked about our motion, you know, we exclusively focus on, you know, fins in the space. Right.
Agent: We did that for a lot of reasons, but just to build that subject matter expertise, you know, the best practices lessons learned and, you know, this is a sweet spot for us.
Agent: But what we do differently, I think, and what we focus on is a priority. is these four pillars, data first . you'll see that come up and be part of the motio n throughout our plan .
Agent: This data strategy is right . so important so you can unlock future value . you'll see that show up in some of the [PERSON-5] y and some of our discovery . other thing is customer success, the service .
Agent: Time I came up from mentioned this , that heightened focus on the process [NORP-1] e that goes into deploying capabilities . you get real value .
Agent: Super important where we've doubled down, it becomes part of our playbook for doing this.
Agent: But the critic [PERSON-6] elements of that are things like adoption planning, change management, but also benchmarking [PERSON-7] KPIs and thinking about the end user experience, all that's built into how we govern and [PERSON-8] know, the third pillar down there on the lower right, you know, we think about this as a statement of outcomes.
Agent: And you kind of see that as [PERSON-4] walks through it, but it's really important that we focus on delivering outcomes, not just a platform. Not just getting to a delivery date with the technology.
Agent: And we do that for number of reasons. One, we want to make sure you bought [ORG-1] for a reason.
Agent: So how is that going to show up in terms of the actual value creation for the company, whether it's some productivity or revenue or even process improvements or throughput. But it's really important that we focus on the outcomes.
Agent: And that becomes an undercurrent as we deliver. We're always thinking about that from a UI perspective, an Integration perspective, process. improvement perspective.
Agent: And then we do a lot of risk sharing deals and happy to elaborate tha t on that, [PERSON-9], as you dig into this and you have questions later on.
Agent: But I think it's importan t for the [PRODUCT-1] to have skin in the game . And that can show up a lot of different ways.
Agent: But it's either way, the point here is that we're making a commitment, and this is going to be a partnership.
Agent: And there are a number of ways to hold us accountable and happy to dig in when that comes up.
EndUser: Because that's a really in terms of our partnership.
Agent: Big tenet for us
EndUser: So I got a I get this is great. It hits exactly the notes that I think are the greatest concern. You probably hear this in other institutions you work with. Right. For us, it's not the platform.
EndUser: It is the outcome. And, you know, the biggest fear and concern is the adoption, you know, and we, and I've told the team this probably 238 times. He's probably sick of hearing it.
EndUser: We adopted And, you know, [DATE-1], again, a lot was promised Not so much was delivered And it's not just technology-based, but it was just whatever the deployment process [PERSON-10] in this predates me, people just lost confidence platform itself, and it's been a struggl e to get them to use it So, we're sort of doubling down on the [ORG-1] platform Thanks for watching Thanks for watching .
Agent: In the
EndUser: Where people are like, oh, you know, sort of try to once with [ORG-2], why are we doing it again?
EndUser: And so really what I want to hone in on is, you know, the element of what is going to, or how can we hold people What have you seen work and not work in other financial institutions as far as, you know, adaptability.
Agent: Accountable?
EndUser: Obviously some outcomes in terms of numbers is great, but there's also just like soft stuff.
EndUser: Like how many people, like how often do people log in [DATE-2] or how many transactions are actually flowing through the system?
EndUser: Those are the kinds of things that I want to make sure that we bake into the deployment so that we know really early
Agent: On, all right, this is on the right track or not. I don't want to wait [DATE-3] to figure out well I know what's using this thing. Yeah, and sure that is so important.
Agent: And that was part of the reason when we created this motion was because of the number of times I heard those types of things.
Agent: Like when I was at [ORG-1] and responsible for customer success there, how many times it was, it was never the technology. It was because the end users didn't know why they were using the platform.
Agent: Or they didn't know how they were gonna contribute to the company's growth. And so that was a big driver for building this model. And I'll tell you the cool thing is it works.
Agent: Right?
Agent: And I won't elaborate now, but I can share like the stories later. But what I'll say is like, you know, part of what we, you know, that commitment could be.
Agent: You know, X percentage adoption or X log in rate.
Agent: And the reason whether it's that or otherwise, but you know, you talk about best practices, if you start with that in mind, like it starts at the very beginning of this, of this process, like you're not waiting to adoption plan late, like you have a whole communications plan around what's in it for you as the end user, and you benchmark specific KPIs that they're gonna be responsible for driving.
Agent: And that, you know, their experience matters.
Agent: So, you know, getting them involved into the process, right?
Agent: So that user experience. in the end user sentiment are really high coming out of it becaus e It's gonna, they're gonna wanna use it. They're gonna know why it's important to them. And actually, [PERSON-9]'s on the call.
Agent: We just did this with another customer where they got to the end of this. And I told a big portion of how this work too, if we govern this really well.
Agent: So I don't want, if we did this together, I want the CFO to sign off on where you are [DATE-4]. Here's where these things are. That way, at the end of it, there's no ambiguity.
Agent: And we got to the end of this thing and all the, it was great, the CEO, everybody was in the room. And I said, hey, have them walk around the branches, ask the questions.
Agent: And they did, and to a branch, they came back and said, yeah, the end user's saying it's faster, that they're able to get more work done.
Agent: It's a good experience, right?
Agent: But you don't hope that happens. You build it into the comms plan, the enablement. how you want them to understand what they're going to do to help the company grow.
Agent: So it's a cool motion, but it requires everybody to be bought in, the leadership team at the
Agent: Customer, bringing our motion to bear, and really focusing on that as a critical outcome for [DATE-5].
Agent: Yeah, and just to add on to that, I mean, that really comes down to your change management plan and how you're communicating that to your users as well, but they know what to expect.
Agent: They understand the value before they're just getting trained on how to use it. What's
EndUser: Coming?
EndUser: How they're going to be impacted?
EndUser: How is it going to help them service customers better?
EndUser: Do their job more efficiently?
EndUser: And so forth. So all those things. And [PERSON-9], that's a great point. And to that point, do you guys offer material that we can
Agent: Leverage as far as that communication plan?
Agent: Or are we basically starting from scratch?
Agent: Yeah, so you'll see kind of in our proposal what our recommendation is having that assessment upfront and then having our change management consultant work with your team to create those comms and help guide that.
Agent: So we don't if we create the Content we can do that that's usually, you know, how much of the work you want us doing versus
Agent: Advising on we can do full in full suite for you, Shreve.
Agent: And that's where we're going to come together on this plan and say, all right, what's right for you in this phase and but you're getting back to what [PERSON-4] said, there are options. for who's going to do it.
EndUser: Like, you know,
Agent: But the thing is like having an accountability mode l where you somebody is going to do it though, right?
Agent: And we can do it. Correct. The other thing is w e have best practices.
Agent: We also hav e I mean from the myriad other engagements that we can leverage, you know, whether they're, you know, templates for comms or like incentives option.
EndUser: To try
Agent: So there's a lot of carrot stick and it just depends on your culture, your needs, you know, and what you're expecting from them.
Agent: But we can definitely whether we do it in advisory capacity, we just run the whole thing for you.
Agent: It's, you know, I can have this, you know, start and go, okay, what do I do, right?
Agent: There's a playbook. collateral, things like that. And we'll just figure out what's the best thing for your organization, your culture, and your history of doing these types of changes.
EndUser: Yeah, just to set the expectations, I mean, everyone here is ready to roll up their sleeves and do their part.
EndUser: So it's not the kind of thing where we just want to like, you know, outsource and just hands off and say, okay, that's hope this, that's how it works.
EndUser: I think it was more, we went through, I would say on a much smaller scale, the deployment of using [ORG-3] across the entire organization.
EndUser: And I got to admit, [ORG-3] was just fantastic in terms of their, the resources they provided to us. at the various stages of that communication and rollout that really, you know, could have been better in some areas, absolutely.
EndUser: But I mean, we got through it in a way that, you know, we're, you know, it is our standard de facto, you know, Messaging school at this point.
EndUser: So I think it's more just, you know, the material that's provided based off of what you see and work and not work with other organizations.
EndUser: I think, again, that's always a good starting point rather than starting from the absolute aspect. I don't want to do on this.
Agent: I know this as well. Yeah, go
EndUser: Ahead.
Agent: Yeah, awesome. Well, yeah, so I wanted to start there, right, because we're already sharing mutual understanding of how we want to view this project. The second piece is we haven't defined what those outcomes should be yet.
Agent: So that'll be a next step before we put a contract together and say, okay, what are the outcomes you want to see?
Agent: And I'll go over some categories of how we typically look at this with customers and where we want to focus on.
Agent: But I want to make sure to note that ahead of time to start thinking about that, because that is a gap that we want to fill in order to make this.
Agent: Is the full agreement that we all feel comfortable moving forward with . [PERSON-9]. So I won't harbor on this slide for very long either, but I put this up here because we have a practice around this entire circle.
Agent: And you're hitting a lot of areas within the circle, right?
Agent: We are using [ORG-4] for financial services, which is built for your industry, but we're also tapping into [ORG-2] and that question of how do these things work together?
Agent: Where does one start?
Agent: Where does one end?
Agent: And when we bring them together, what are the potential risks of doing that we need to assess?
Agent: So we'll want to get into that in this conversation Make sure we've got change management as a plan in this place But on the other side, on the left-hand side business intelligence, you're using [PERSON-9] [DATE-4] You've got [ORG-5] analytics built into your proposal here So how are we leveraging those [PRODUCT-2] capabilities the reporting analytics that you're going to want to se e to help automate and streamline your business And then the Marketing expertise that we're going to b e bringing to your team, which we love They've already had a lot of exposure to [WORK_OF_ART-1] in the past life but now we're going to bring it to connect one, you're going to make it your ow n. So we're going to get you that foundation so they can really centralize the busine ss and the efforts of growing the business, nurturing the current clients and [ORG-6] so you can see the growth that you're expectin g. And so we're here to help you, but you'll see a lot of resources, line item resources towards this project because of that.
Agent: We're bringing in experts in these spaces so you have a scalable platform. All right, a lot of words on the screen.
Agent: I bolded some kind of major highlights, pain points, challenges, and goals that we're kind of using the focus of why we're doing what we're doing.
Agent: But you want to leverage [ORG-1] ultimately in conjunction with what you have in it, so you know, to create this true end-to-end Enterprise platform that is scalable for both the retail and commercial businesses.
Agent: You were sold that within C&O. It didn't come to fruition.
Agent: So now really how do we create this platform that's going to allow you to grow as you exceed that [MONEY-1] mark and move forward across all the business lines?
Agent: Thank you. So [DATE-4] what we're going to do is we're going to bring those teams together through data, through central processes. We're going to get retail off operating those spreadsheets.
Agent: And by retail, I mean the deposit team because that's what key to what we're focusing on.
Agent: And then we're going to help move manual efforts from your Marketing team, the difficulty of segmentation and being able to cross-sell across the business to your business lines. And that transparency.
Agent: Is going to allow you guys to build out this more singular view of your customers . they're not having to go to multiple systems . all going to be in one place .
Agent: Communication is going to be in one place . the right hand knows what the left hand's doing . knows the rates that deposit is doing and vice versa within your organization .
Agent: So everyone's operating and enjoying putting information in the [ORG-1] , that's where they're going to get it back out of . And then in general, I highlighted it. You already mentioned it. Training and adoption are critical.
Agent: You heard it from your leaders already across the business. Everyone has this as top of mind. So we'll go through our plan where we can support your team there.
Agent: And then the tech stack I put underneath, a lot of this we're gonna touch. Some will be in future states, but a lot of it is inherent to the information that you're gonna need and where it lives [DATE-4].
Agent: It's as far as centralizing this platform with [ORG-1].
EndUser: Any questions, concerns, things that I didn't highlight that you want to make sure we're touching?
Agent: Yeah, thank you, right?
Agent: You hit them all. Now let's get into what does the solution look like. And so I'll talk just a second here on our phasing methodology.
Agent: So just with anything, a good plan in place really starts us off on the right foot. And so we don't do implementations as one big bang because they're typically not successful.
Agent: And so what we want to do is start with those objectives and goals, find themes throughout, and then create this phased approach within your business of how we can roll this out so you can actually see the change adoption that you're hoping for .
Agent: [PERSON-10], it's scalable , then we can also stretch out the cost for yo u as a business so you can start recognizing value earlie r than having to wait, again, [DATE-6], [DATE-7], [DATE-8] down the road .
Agent: Thanks for watching!
Agent: We'll put these phases together in this middle ground of how we're going to execute, which I'll go into our methodology later on, but we have this hybrid agile methodology that we leverage in order to make sure we're not getting to the end of our timed project.
Agent: And then we're saying, hey, there's all these changes that didn't meet expectations from the business line. And ultimately we're dissatisfied with your product.
Agent: And so we'll be able to measure success as we go before we get to the end and make sure that we have the adoption and capacity satisfied to hit those target goals.
Agent: Any questions around that methodology?
EndUser: Yep. Okay.
Agent: So from a phased viewpoint, this was kind of our example that we'd like to follow as a roadmap. And so you'll see three boxes here.
Agent: We didn't even move into phase three yet because that's time down the road where we'll learn a lot as we meet with your organization.
Agent: Right?
Agent: We've had maybe [TIME-1] total of conversations with [ORG-7], but a lot of the challenges are similar. And so we're taking our expertise that we've seen in the past and putting it into what we know.
Agent: And so phase one on the left-hand side, that is what we currently want to create this proposal for.
Agent: What do we need to start with?
Agent: And that kind of low-hanging fruit. that you mentioned so you can achieve value faster .
Agent: Initially, you mentioned that what is a [DATE-9] timeframe look like?
Agent: I don't think we need that much timeframe in order to achieve value. So we'd like to accelerate that so you can start having a fast follow with the licenses that you purchase to start bringing on other groups.
Agent: And so what we're going to start with is that platform setup.
Agent: So baseline, what do we need from a [ORG-1] perspective that we don't have in [ORG-8] that we're going to need [DATE-4] within our user groups that are going to be on this, right?
Agent: And so you'll see line items there. And then financial services.
Agent: This is the actual data model that you're going to build upon In the future, you're going to receive all those releases from [PERSON-18] a or from [ORG-1] over [DATE-10] that are going to keep [PERSON-16] your business forward without you having to do anything We've got to get that set up for your current deposit grou [ORG-9] and then your commercial lending group And so you'll see we're going to focus on opportunities, sales managemen t and then case management .
Agent: Which is bringing in the operations team within your deposit group and then commercial lending.
Agent: They're using it [DATE-4], but they don't have the data, right?
Agent: So we need to start bringing in that deposit data into their purview, making sure that they can operate and see that full product suite so they can do their jobs more efficiently.
Agent: And there is an upgrade that has to happen. And we'll go into the details there, but that is a key critical piece that we can't just plug in [ORG-1] and everyone's happy.
Agent: We need to understand what's been built [DATE-4], what's gonna be impacted by the current data model that you have versus [ORG-4], and make sure that that's streamlined together. And then we're gonna stand up your [WORK_OF_ART-1] team.
Agent: It looks like I apologize, it's kind of cut off here, but there is journeys that are gonna be built in that as well.
Agent: And then there's going to be some critical integrations at the bottom that we're going to focus on [DATE-4]. The [ORG-10], connecting to email, that's where you're living [DATE-4].
Agent: But we also want to get you connected to your warehouse because that seems to be the focal point of all your data moving in the future.
Agent: So it doesn't all have to be there, but we will assume that some data will be there that's not in core.
Agent: And then ultimately, that'll allow us to create a platform that will help you scale out in the future where we can just start going to that warehouse and pulling new data into as the business needs.
Agent: We're also going to tap into the core and then Marketing cloud. So there is a connector that's prebuilt between those two systems that will want to engage. So you have that data flowing from [WORK_OF_ART-1] to [ORG-1].
EndUser: I guess this in terms of integrations, I'd want to include [ORG-3], elevate that's part of the proposal. That doesn't, I don't think that'll be a heavy lift on that.
EndUser: You know, I don't know how plug and play that is. The other. The other piece is
EndUser: [PERSON-9] cloud. I don't mean like a full blown Integration at this point, but at least, I mean, we're sort of on that parallel track anyway.
EndUser: So I'm not really sure how much needs to happen in order for it to be accessible and just light communication of some sort. If there's something in tableau, maybe being able to access it in some way.
EndUser: But I think that's going to be really key, again, and if I go to the church and I just like to listen to it, I'll focus on the question, I'll try what's going on.
EndUser: And I think it's a mess that I guys do. access to data visualization component.
Agent: Yeah, that makes sense.
Agent: I think one thing to call it too, just to, you know, as [PERSON-4] is walking through these was that, listen, that we've kind of phased these things out based on customers we've helped, but ultimately these things can move in and out, you know, if you're looking from commercial, they'll be like, hey, household, it would be, that's really a day one thing for us, like, you know, we can, we can do that in initial proposal or maybe something where we discover all of the key elements and really get a handle on the amount of effort and we're able to pull some of these things in.
Agent: I think kind of we had [ORG-3] and tableau.
Agent: I know you're using [PERSON-9] [DATE-4], right?
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: We're using the the on-prem version though, so we're part of this whole thing is migrating to cloud.
EndUser: Yep, so then we can definitely pull that into this to pull those into this phase. We barely scratch on [PERSON-9].
EndUser: I mean, I think I'm just saying that I just want it to be even very lightly in scope in that first sort of quarter. We're doing it.
Agent: We again using several so there's not a cold but [DATE-4] they're my creations or anything like that so yeah Yeah, and so that's a good call out.
EndUser: We barely we just started
Agent: We'll make sure to have that. I do have in this second phase, so this is where we call expansion in seeing that full license activation that you're looking to contract now.
Agent: So that's gonna bring in the rest of the business.
Agent: That's not on [ORG-1] [DATE-4], across all the retail groups, your commercial expansion, contact center, right?
Agent: Telephony integrations, [ORG-9] management was also a key aspect and a pain point that we discussed with the team that could be a phase two.
Agent: And so I did put on the analytics and upgrade That [ORG-3] upgrade, you have [ORG-3] [DATE-4] so you're gonna get additional capabilities with i t with the licensing, a lot around AI So we can bring that into this phase one, if needed Otherwise, the thought process in moving keeping that in the phase two is you're gonna bring it on new people They're using [ORG-3] [DATE-4] but they wanna be leveraging [ORG-1] as the too l and the data that's moving in and out So once we're structuring that you're gonna have more power from the [ORG-9] e that is gonna be hard holistic to the platform versus kind of chunking those out in between those phases.
Agent: So it 's something we can do and start.
EndUser: We just didn't have that included in this first phase on [NORP-2]EndUser: I think you can argue both ways. I think the sooner that people can actually touch it in some form and get data in and adoption rate and the usefulness is going to become more apparent.
Agent: Out, the
EndUser: I'm...
EndUser: I think that's something we can we need to go on now. I mean, whether it's been
Agent: Around but Yeah Yeah, and again right where we're operating off of a range So we have flexibility in there and we're just gonna try to narrow down what should one here Cool.
EndUser: Be in the phase
Agent: So from a phase being standpoint, you know progress Does this look does this align with the main goals that you have as an organization and kind of that fast follow approach?
EndUser: Accelerating value up front. Yeah, no, really, phase one looks really good. And phase two, I think, is basically everything else.
Agent: So it makes perfect sense. Okay. And we'll go in more details on the phase one scope. So I have more line items here. Again, we're not going to go into every detail.
Agent: I'll leave this as a takeaway for you to digest and make sure we're hitting it all.
Agent: Because there's a lot within these things, but we do have some of these called out and we can update these before we send it to you, right?
Agent: For some of that tableau. But things to note here like training, our typical training processes, training the trainers. So we wouldn't do any.
Agent: We can do end user training and I'll get through that in the next section here But we would assume in this kind of proposal, train the trainers is the model user training .
EndUser: And you all would do the end Current.
Agent: And then some of the assumptions here, which I'll get to in a subsequent slide, upgrading the person accounts.
Agent: That's actually one of those critical pieces between [ORG-2] and [ORG-1] that you have to review prior, which [ORG-2] users are not on [DATE-4].
Agent: We're going to be leveraging a lot of the out-of-box dashboards and reports [DATE-4] for that first phase one.
Agent: And then you can customize as needed or we can Then the integration, access that data again, what's in core, what's in the warehouse We don't know that yet, which we'll find in an assessment Then have to take that into account for the data considerations, the state of the data .
Agent: That's all inherently built in.
Agent: So what I want to focus on is the business value, right?
Agent: What are you going to get out of this?
Agent: You're going to get a lot built from a technical aspect, but kind of top down goes from the core aspects of value through Marketing cloud.
Agent: And then when are we going to sunset some technology that you'll have [DATE-4]?
Agent: And so by centralizing all this information, we know one thing is, all right, we're going to provide you the avenue to come and look and find all the information. That's great.
Agent: How do we encourage your users to actually put the information there?
Agent: [DATE-9], how can we automate that to make their lives easier, but your commercia l and retail groups should have information living in [ORG-1] . which is a huge value add by being able to understand your clients better.
Agent: The product suites that they have, the communication that's happening, the issues and service use cases that are coming up. We want to make sure that that's in there inherent to day one.
Agent: Set up that internal reports and dashboards even though you have good reporting [DATE-4]. Not everyone does.
Agent: And so how do we unify that again all the way up through the executive level?
Agent: And then we're going to really focus on your Marketing team. So they're going to have integrated campaigns.
Agent: So when they launch a campaign, your sales team knows what's going on, and they can tap into that and start seeing value from that, have templated emails that they can send that are approved from Marketing so that their life is easier and automated.
Agent: We're going to automate those [DATE-9] newsletters that are already going out.
Agent: And then they're going to be able to segment those audiences that they have based on traffic and leads that are coming through the website without having to manually.
Agent: Update those lists every time they want to send that out what you're doing in [ORG-9] . And then at the end of this, you can expect us to remove the [PRODUCT-3] spreadsheets.
Agent: So, you know, cut it off, get rid of the licensing. Don't let folks use that anymore. [ORG-1] is going to be your source of truth in sunset and [GPE-1].
Agent: So that'll be another system in place that hopefully we can remove that. This will satisfy any other business value aspects that you want to make sure that we're touching on or questions.
Agent: Hey, is this going to be delivered in this first scope?
Agent: I know it's a lot to digest, but.
EndUser: I mean,
EndUser: I guess nothing tangible. Again, I think business value is actually people using it. Going back to the adoption piece of it with better, cleaner data.
EndUser: And I'm not sure if that's even quantifiable in some way, but I think that we don't have. quality data and I don't, I think that would be
Agent: A goal for this deployment. Yeah, so as part of this scope, we're going to do a data assessment.
Agent: And so where's the data living?
Agent: What current state it is?
Agent: And then how are we going to bring that data into [ORG-1]?
Agent: And so we'll want to be really thoughtful on what data lives in [ORG-1] and where it's coming from, and then how we structure the system for your users.
Agent: To help guide them to say, all right, you have to enter these key pieces of information.
Agent: We can't give you every option in the world, otherwise we're not going to get anything, right?
Agent: And then we're going to build a plan that's going to help them be. successful in that to enter in clean where we need it .
EndUser: Data
Agent: No one
Agent: Has [PERCENT-1] clean data, but it's going to be critical. I'll be just a little front.
Agent: Yeah, I think the goal really is to, I mean, this is an upgrade, right?
Agent: We don't want to just take your data that you have and dump it into [ORG-1]. That would be helpful. So it's a little bit about strategizing where the data goes. It's also taking a look at what you have.
Agent: You know, to your point, there's no magic button.
Agent: You can clean up all the data necessarily, but we can have a strategy for what makes it over and build that in the framework of how they're going to use it going forward.
EndUser: So. It's really too full
Agent: And we have, you know, this is part of that initial phase. Yeah.
Agent: And so even though this is phase one, there's a lot within that, right?
Agent: Getting the foundation right is going to be critical, upgrading your [ORG-2] org so that it's going to work and we're not going to break things down the road, critical, bringing [WORK_OF_ART-1] and making sure that data model fits all three systems going to be critical.
Agent: And then the training and adoption on the back end, also a key area focus.
Agent: So, There is going to be a lot of coordination that goes into this, but we're excited about that because that's where our teams live and strive.
EndUser: We're going to
Agent: Go over a little bit of this phase one architecture, what it looks like briefly, we'll go into our methodology and then talk about some of the nuances. All right. Cool.
Agent: What you're looking at here is pretty additive to what you have [DATE-4].
Agent: This is just really high level of that left-hand column we showed initially, it was going to be impacted in phase one, as well as data we're bringing into the system and the clouds that are at play.
Agent: So on the right-hand side, you see your commercial [GPE-2], that's kind of where you're starting, right?
Agent: Your commercial folks are leveraging. And so you know, everything to the left of that is where this is gonna be additive. And then the folks at the top are who is gonna be impacted.
Agent: So kind of going from right to left to right, starting with your Integration paths.
Agent: Right now we took the note that you have, you know, you have a data strategy, you're sort of in the process of fulfilling data may exist in a couple of different places to start.
Agent: For now, let's make a point of connecting to two different sources for some of that core data to bring in for the deposit on the commercial teams from an accounts context and relationships perspective.
Agent: From an [ORG-10] Redshift, you know, we understand we can use a connector on the [ORG-10] side. And then from [ORG-18], we've done a number of these.
Agent: I think we've used [ORG-16]'s [ORG-21] in the past and there may be other ways to connect.
Agent: But ultimately, it's really just kind of that one way direction in the sales force to make sure that your latest and greatest from.
Agent: Your core and your warehouse are really feeding into the account details and context and relationships So that the both the deposit and the commercial teams can essentially run their deal cycles So looking kind of data down into [ORG-21] cloud is really all the things that [ORG-4] kind of does really well, which is around those financial accounts and roles we mentioned person accounts Managing contacts your leads and referrals running deal cycles or opportunity management Activity management, that's your loga calls, all of your activities for both of your business units, relationships, maps, reports and dashboards, kind of the out-of-the-box feature of [ORG-1] as well as cases.
Agent: Right now, we've took sort of an approach of some internal folks will be using [ORG-1] and they might want to log some cases.
Agent: Internally, maybe down the road, we continue to leverage cases for the context center, but really this is kind of around that end-user experience for both the deposit and the commercial team on the [ORG-4] side.
Agent: And then down below is really everything marketing, kind of in three major buckets here.
Agent: So the journeys that [ORG-1] demoed for you in regards to that sort of work path for who gets notified for net new leads and getting them on a Marketing journey, helping your team understand how to build in email templates.
Agent: We understand they're very capable. You have a great Marketing team. But we really want to show them what [ORG-1] can do so that they can continue to create great [PRODUCT-4] on the Marketing Cloud platform.
Agent: And then personalization as well. So this is everything from. your front facing experience and starting to use that data to drive that new campaigns and put folks on those journeys.
Agent: This is everything we're thinking of tackling in that initial phase.
Agent: Again, this can be in flux in terms of what exactly we integrate, but from a source systems perspective and a cloud's perspective, and users impacted perspective, this is what we're thinking about for phase one.
Agent: For cases, does it?
Agent: Just a native functionality inside of [ORG-1].
Agent: Is that leverage?
Agent: I mean, I guess everything is native in [ORG-1], but is it like the help desk system as well?
Agent: Or is it just a case management system?
Agent: Like, wow. It's not being familiar with [ORG-1] directly.
Agent: Can you just give like [TIME-2] overview of that?
Agent: Yeah. So when you purchase [ORG-4] licenses, it kind of gives you a mix of the additional sales functionality on top of your standard sales. And it also gives you, service and sales force identifies services, a CAFE model.
Agent: So really, I think what's kind of included in this phase one is, you know, basic triaging and routing, basic assignments, basic types for cases, really so that if you're depositing commercial folks, you need to log a case and we need to route it effectively and sort of solve for it.
Agent: We can.
Agent: I think down the line, we kind of had planned for more of a context-centered use case, which is like kind of outside your system intakes of cases and time to them accounts and resolve in them that way.
Agent: I guess short answer is it's really just kind of like basic
EndUser: Ticketing for your internal team
Agent: At this phase. But the case has service level agreements.
Agent: Management function analogy
Agent: You can do escalations. You can assign cases to queues or to individuals. You can get really smart about assignments where it's skills based, where you can actually route the cases based on skills to the appropriate people.
Agent: So it is a true call center service application, knowledge management. We don't have knowledge included in phase one. That's more of a phase two thing. But you can have internal knowledge for your users.
Agent: You can also have external knowledge. that's available to customers.
Agent: And you can segregate how that is viewed and what's available to each side And with all of the other functionality that's coming with Salesforce 2 from an [PRODUCT-2] perspective .
Agent: Based on you know the categorization of the case and the context of the case They can even start to suggest Knowledge Articles and resolutions and things like that.
EndUser: So it's it's a very sophisticated Contact call tool a full-blown version of Service Cloud or like is it and service cloud?
Agent: Center management
Agent: But I mean is it
EndUser: So it is service-fed as baked into this.
EndUser: I guess I mean, I guess I'm not even I'm not surprised but I just wasn't sure so I guess we're just quick because I mean we're looking at it at a separate Potentially help that system internally for the organization, but if we really have Service Cloud that may just maybe not need it Right, I think that's kind of the approach we took with this initial phase was that we know we didn't speak to any context center folks I think we got a light understanding there but you know you do have it as a part of the suite right is the services of financial services.
EndUser: So we'd like to configure
Agent: Some of it but ultimately looking forward yes this absolutely could service that particular solution. Okay. Yeah, it's instead of adding another solution and cost if you're already paying for to recommendation.
EndUser: Good things to think about
EndUser: It in licenses
Agent: Leverage it right
Agent: Came we got the thumbs up for my king. All right. Love that. Love to hear that. All right, so we'll keep moving. We got quite a bit left here.
Agent: So I'll breeze over some of this that we can talk in later. I already mentioned we leverage an agile methodology here.
Agent: So when you talk about how do we mitigate some of that risk to make sure we're aligned during the project, not just waiting till afterwards, things that we do differently.
Agent: The sprint zero after discovery is where we take [DATE-9] to stop. We make sure we have everything collected. It's aligned to the business before we just jump into the sprints for building.
Agent: And then when we do our sprints, we do have demos that happen before the end of the sprint with the stakeholders So we say, all right, is this mean and expectation based on th e requirements that we gathered and the stories that we built We can make small tweaks now so we don't have to wait till the very end And then, you know, as a normal agile methodology, go through [ORG-23], sit training and then deploy [GPE-3].
Agent: And then we have [NORP-3] support that we include here as well .
EndUser: Any questions on our
Agent: Deployment methodology?
Agent: No, okay. Okay. And then I'm going to briefly touch on this. So we've mentioned this before, but it is critical to this piece because as you know, [ORG-1], and [ORG-21], same platform, they have different focuses.
Agent: And so this kind of circle shared objects in the middle, they do share on the platform, and your commercial team are leveraging some of those, but things like person accounts, which you need for [ORG-4] to function, which isn't being leveraged [DATE-4], has some dependencies that we can do.
Agent: We'd have to take into account and understand what's been built [DATE-4] So we don't break something for the commercial team moving forward along thi s journey.
Agent: And so I'll let [PERSON-21] touch on a couple of these as a takeaway And I'll show
Agent: You how we build that into this proposal of how we mitigate . that. Yes, there's really two major things here. [PERSON-4] touched on one of them already, which is the conversion to person accounts.
Agent: So, you know, we talked to the commercial team who's leveraging and saying, you know, you know, they're not using personal accounts, personal accounts for anything [DATE-4].
Agent: Ultimately, what [ORG-4] does is it really kind of expands that model of that single account that you may either that you're using [DATE-4].
Agent: If you have an understanding that some of those are businesses and some of those are people, we can help you move and repoint some of that data.
Agent: If that's not what they're going to be leveraging for all of their data necessarily, that's fine, but it does require that a person account to be enabled and we leverage how to segment the data appropriately.
Agent: So that's a consideration for kind of dropping in [ORG-4] on top of or alongside them, I should say. And, you know, the other kind of the last five bullets here are really around.
Agent: There are some just basic configuration items, you know, not to bore you, but the ground level is really like there's some pick lists that can be consolidated. There's some workflows that can be repointed or turned off.
Agent: Now that you're sort of leveraging more of a full suite for sales.
Agent: So our team, you know, and our CNOX sports will sort of assess where you're at [DATE-4] and obviously knowing that you're moving to [ORG-4] and are able to both implement those changes so that you're harmonized between the two on the platform.
Agent: It also testing those and training to then. put all of those from a commercial side, all of that sales activity that they've been sort of lately leveraging and [ORG-22] to then use [ORG-4].
Agent: So it's really, like I said, two parts. One is the person account model. The second part is really some like configuration on harmonizing the two applications on the platform.
EndUser: Sounds good. Yeah. Obviously critical. So I think the time spent on it is going
Agent: To hopefully it's not under estimated. Right. Yeah. All right, change management and training here.
Agent: So I mentioned our training options, right?
Agent: We've got this functional knowledge transfer, which is to make sure that you know what we've built and you can share that with the end users.
Agent: We've got train the trainer model, which is our standard training model where we'll meet with your stakeholders, who are gonna be the trainers and empower them to lead the end user training.
Agent: And then the full end suite is end user training. We'll work. meeting with your team. We're running all of the content.
Agent: We're running the sessions and we're goin g to deliver this in the impact to your users at the end.
Agent: This increases the scale of cost as you g o through it, which we would want to take into account based on our ROM. We have this kind o f estimated as train the trainer.
Agent: As most of our projects, the high end of this ROM would be wher e we'd want end user training.
Agent: So if you think that you need us to be the actual deliverers of th e training, build the [PRODUCT-4] we would want to know that before putting together the estimat e. So based on current team [DATE-4], I know you have traine rs are building
EndUser: A PM offic e. Do you expect to need us to do end user
Agent: Training on this projec t?
Agent: Now train the trainer, I think is where we're going to be. Beautiful.
Agent: Great. And so now talking about that critical aspect of governance and change management.
Agent: And so how do we model this through?
Agent: We want to make sure we're creating this program execution that doesn't start and stop, but it is ongoing with what we're doing during and after the project.
Agent: And so we're going to include a lot of this on the right-hand side, intake process, prioritization, looking at calendars, roadmap reviews, releases, communications, our carrots, your all the aspects that are gonna be critica l to your governance and that structur e that we're setting out and communicating this earl y and often so that your team knows what's coming down the pipe .
Agent: What does that look like?
Agent: It starts at the top where we're going to make sure we have identified who the sponsors from the executive level are and then that center of excellence.
Agent: Who's going to be that change management lead on your end and then the communications lead?
Agent: That can be the same person, but we're going to identify that with our consultant to make sure they're in line with our process.
Agent: And then who from the business and technology are going to be the leads there that are going to champion this, that are going to bring all this down to the workforce. We'll create that center.
Agent: Of Excellence, how that's going to distribute the actions for this . And then some kind of an example of what that looks like. There's going to be or wide communications that we're going to want to set.
Agent: That are going to go out to everyone. We're going to get people excited about what's coming. They're going to be able to prepare from that.
Agent: And then looking from a line of business perspective, right?
Agent: You're going to have commercial. You're going to have deposits. You're going to have your Marketing team.
Agent: Who are the executive champions?
Agent: We're going to identify your team lead champions and then the end user champions that are going to be the ones that are going to be a part of testing.
Agent: They're going to be ingrained in this, which will showcase on that resource. make up on one of the upcoming slides so we can identify that early . And then last piece, just an example of measurement.
Agent: So where we want to send out these surveys, get your feedback throughout the process of the builds, post [PERSON-21], and tracking those metrics during and at the end to make sure we have a path to launch from and no one's being left behind, right?
Agent: And so we will help create the content. We're going to help create the design and plan with our [ORG-22] team.
Agent: And then that's about the effort, do we want us to be doing alongside you?
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: How much of this
Agent: Your team .
Agent: Any questions before we go into timeline and resources?
Agent: Yep, no, good. Alright. And so looking at from a timeline perspective, I've got our workflows on the left-hand side, which I've bucketed on the [PRODUCT-5] piece, marketing, data and integrations and change management and government.
Agent: So our governance, [DATE-10] is all going to be about discovery design and the assessments. We're going to do the [ORG-2] org assessment to understand what's been built so we know we can get ahead of those risks.
Agent: We're going to do requirements gathering for [PRODUCT-5] and marketing.
Agent: And then we're going to do the data assessment to understand what data we're going to need to put together the [ORG-23] for the actual migration of the data that's going to go into [ORG-1].
Agent: And then that change management assessment where we're going to go and meet with the businesses that are impacted. We're going to understand the [ORG-23] office. We're going to understand the leadership structure and governance structure.
Agent: We're going to create that plan for you to then execute in this build and test.
Agent: Fsc, Encino Upgrade, [PRODUCT-6], start that IP warming, get that data migration effort done, and then those core integrations, and then we're going to execute this communications out.
Agent: Again, we can just do the plan for change management, give it to you and you run with it, or we can help guide that, advise that throughout the process, or we can do it all throughout the entirety of this project.
Agent: Then [DATE-18] we'll
EndUser: Be around training and Go Live.
EndUser: Questions on the timeline?
Agent: No, it seems fairly aggressive, but I'll trust your judgment on that. Yeah, because of the number of users are limited here within this group. We feel that this is a good
EndUser: Timeline that's not pushing it too far too fast, but that's a conversation we wanna have with you based on availability of your resources. Yeah, no, I think it looks great.
EndUser: And I think, like I said, the resources, if we go forward and pull the trigger, are going to be available
Agent: To
Agent: Make it happen. So it looks good. I'm not sure if you can look at, I think [PERSON-4]'s got a slide because it's just not our ability to do this. It's our ability to do it together.
Agent: And so we've taken into consideration. like your broader team's capacity.
Agent: And I think [PERSON-4], if you didn't already fly by it or share it, but we have something in here that shows about how much time each of your teammates, yeah, So that way you can kind of list think, okay, does that reasonable given their current body of work?
EndUser: Right here.
Agent: And, you know, but our experience would tell
EndUser: Us it's not unreasonable to do it the way we just showed up, but it's also important for us to think about the investment of your team's time. Yeah, no, that's that this side is really helpful.
EndUser: I think it's going to
Agent: Help to make sure that we can Make the people that need to be available available. Yeah, so I'll stay on this slide then and just touch on a couple of these aspects.
Agent: The product owner is the most critical resource that we need.
Agent: That's someone that's going to own this project and the platform and say, all right, I'm going to be able to make the decisions for you, [ORG-22], and make sure we're getting you what you need.
Agent: So if the business is having discussions, someone has to say, all right, we're going to go with A versus B, that's the product owner. And they're going to help keep us on track with the team.
Agent: That business analyst role.
Agent: It's kind of like the PM that those two roles can be the same person They can be multiple people depending on capacity to fill that role to make sure we're gettin g the right SMEs in We're all aligned on what we need to accomplish and that we're all operating on the [PERSON-23] e user stories that are being signed off .
Agent: And then those business SMEs, we've met a lot of them already, which is awesome. We're going to want to bring them in and make sure, again, what we're building helps solve their [DATE-16] life. They're the experts.
Agent: They know what they need. And so we're going to show them how it's built and make sure we get the feedback from them.
Agent: Technical team obviously with the integrations and data and then you have an admin [DATE-4] but no one specifically for sales for us. So depending on capacity that could be that or if you're hiring someone
EndUser: Same person new we'd want to bring them on. Ideally before we start building so they can see the build with us as we go along to then only afterwards.
Agent: Yep now it will be just the the incident rabbit, but we'll with people can <inaudible>.
EndUser: That's right
Agent: Okay. So we'll say.
Agent: So take away here if there's any concerns into the level of need, right?
Agent: That we estimate here or gaps. We want to know those so we can help you fill them or, um, now find the fill or be the fill.
Agent: Um, But I'll go back and just showcase this is our proposed plan over the course of [DATE-21]. So like I said, there's a lot of folks here.
Agent: The top two resources are going to be for project management to make sure that we're all staying on track with the KPIs, business outcomes, we're determining and gathering the right folks.
Agent: And you have alignment here from directly from the project to the executive team with our senior engagement manager.
Agent: Then we've got the solution architects, consultant, which is basically our business analyst and configuration specialists that are going to be doing a lot of the design and build for the [ORG-21], the analytics piece that we're going to be doing in phase one.
Agent: We are bringing on an [ORG-2] architect for discovery in a low usage to review your org. And this is where we're going to find out those gaps in the impact.
Agent: We've already built in [TIME-3] to say to make the improvements and configurations, but they're going to determine, ultimately, that we're on track. And then we'll start the Marketing Cloud effort with two resources there, the Integration resources, QA engineer.
Agent: Most of our clients don't have that. We like adding it in because it is helpful. It's a lot.
Agent: Cost resource and we're making sure that we're really doing the proper QA before moving forward If you have that set, if you're confident in your team, I can remove that resource and we don't nee d to
EndUser: Use it . But we always added in
Agent: On the first swing. And I think we should definitely have that even if it's a second pair of eyes. Okay. And then the data analysts, again, they're just coming in to put together the assessment.
Agent: They will be an effort. They'll generate to say, all right, now we've determined together what data needs to come over. This would be the effort. Your team can do the effort. Our team can do the effort.
Agent: That would be a separate SOW once we've determined really what that would look like based on the data needs.
Agent: And then critical piece change management consultant, we used to put that as optional, but based on what we've heard, we think that this halftime resource for change management consultant to do the assessment upfront and then roll out the plan with your team would be critical to achieving the success and adoption that you have.
Agent: Or you're looking for. I'll let you read over their.
Agent: Descriptions later. So investments and next steps. What we're missing here that's tied to it are these value measures. And so these are the things we want to define later on after this call [PERSON-9].
Agent: And typically what we've done with our partners is we're defining some areas of this bucket we want to put into our contract to say, all right, we're purchasing 304 plus licenses. Phase one is going to impact 28.
Agent: So we want to have a model where [PERCENT-2] of these are activated and adopt.
Agent: Adopted by the end of this project or by the end of [PERSON-21] date So we'll work with you to make sure that these are realistic and accurate goals tha t we're both marching towards and that the user adoption So the user login and utilization, how many times are people logging into the system an d actually inputting information Those are things you can track in [ORG-1] and we can build reports for and we'll [PERSON-22] t to do that so you can track it internally and we can make sure that we're on track And capability deployment, process automation, system retirement Can you get rid of the spreadsheet or do we still need the spreadsheet to do stuf f?
Agent: Do we still need MailChimp to send out emails after you stood up Marketing clou d?
Agent: Those would be fails in our eyes.
Agent: So we want to make sure we're we have those target [ORG-20] es So I'll set time with you, Shrief and anyone else that we need you to help define these within our agreement.
Agent: But these are part of the levers and how we built this proposal you.
EndUser: Together for Any questions around these?
Agent: No, are there can you areas that you would want to say, all right, this is where we really want to focus on. I know user adoption keeps coming up, but any other
EndUser: Areas off the cuff, I think process optimization is also another one.
EndUser: I think that we could probably identify a handful of processes that because we have system in place, we, you know, either communication is enhanced or number of steps or time or whatever is improved.
Agent: So I think that's another put.
Agent: One I think I'd like to So.
Agent: Okay. Yeah. It's good. Yeah, good feedback. All right, so now we don't have a lot of time. I apologize. We had a really good conversation.
Agent: So here's the ROM that we put for this first, again, phase one, right?
Agent: We're breaking these up in the two phases to get everyone on boarded. This is our initial estimate from a range depending on a number of factors.
Agent: So length of contract, the scope that we're including, the upgrade complexity, number of clouds we're leveraging across, you know, sales, Marketing cloud, [PERSON-9], [ORG-3], the data migration level of effort, which will.
Agent: You can find out after the assessment and then the change management piece, right So depending on how much work we're doing on that end versus not is important .
Agent: I'd say I don't think we've heard any big gotchas on this call. It kind of aligns with where we're expecting. And so, and again, Shreve, this is just kind of rack rates off the base.
Agent: Sorry, I'm pulling up my spreadsheet. We'd be looking at within that range confidently [MONEY-2] between that range with the scope included based on the ask that you made with the resources on the right.
Agent: So I'll pause there and make sure is that higher, is that accurate?
Agent: Does that align with your expectations?
Agent: We're phase one.
Agent: Where do we need to be here to make sure that you're successful?
EndUser: Yeah, well, I mean, there's probably no surprise to say that it's probably higher than I expected. I'll say the same thing that I said to [PERSON-1] as far as just the general contract on the [ORG-1] side.
EndUser: We're interested, this is still an internal self that I got to make to the, essentially, the CEO, the [ORG-23] and the president, right?
EndUser: So they, they... They're the ones that have lived through this history of a failed deployment.
EndUser: The investment, you know, [PERSON-2], you talked about like having skin in the game and I think that that's going to go a long way in terms of just sort of, you know, easing some of those concerns.
EndUser: But also, I mean, it is the price tag for a phase one. There's going to be a phase two. And I think there has to be some.
EndUser: Some validation to show that this is working. And I think that if you guys can work on those numbers sharp in the pencil a little bit, get that, I'm gonna ask for two things.
EndUser: I don't wanna arrange, I need a fixed cost. So it takes [DATE-3], it takes [DATE-21].
EndUser: We're not gonna just sit there and say, we're gonna keep spending [MONEY-3] to get to where we thought we were gonna be.
Agent: Just
EndUser: Yeah, so I'm looking, you know, but if you, from what I've seen here, it feels like that four two [DATE-23] range is realistic. And, you know, and I think we could put a fixed cost around it.
EndUser: I will say that at fixed cost, at the lower end of that spectrum, you know, slightly lower, I mean, if we could just cap it at a, at under 429, I think it's going to be just easier.
EndUser: It's the total price tag that I'm having to present. It's obviously an important piece of the entire puzzle. But I guess that we get this in place.
EndUser: We show that it's the metrics that we, in the KPIs that we sort of set out that this deployment is going to have, the training, the communication, all of it.
EndUser: I mean, having it, having it, having it, to come together and actually see the value, again, we'll make a phase two a lot more palatable and we can certainly
Agent: Discuss that at that time. But that's kind of my initial reaction. Yeah, super helpful. And I appreciate the feedback.
Agent: Because again, we need to find where that common ground is, right?
Agent: And so one thing that we won't do because we've been doing this long enough as advisors is remove resources to try to meet a cost because that's when we have projects fall apart.
Agent: So we are going to put the best plan in place. We need to make sure we're at least aligned on what we're expecting from an outcome and the scope that's included.
Agent: And then we can work on, you know, cost factors from there.
Agent: So what I'd like to do moving forward is digest us with the team It sounds like we're really aligne d with what you're expecting to fin d and what's within that phase one So we'll get that final cost to you kind of, or actually the close cost, right And then determine how far away we are from a gap as far as expectations from budge t and if we need to come up with a even more granula r phased approach to make phase one digestibl e and what some options are and go from there One thing I didn't want to do [PERSON-22], if it's slowed down the process .
Agent: We are selling humans, righ t?
Agent: [ORG-29] So it's very important that we have the right peop le aligned here, but our [DATE-21] is in [DATE-22] 42s t. So I don't want you to lose out on a better [PERSON-23] as you negotiate with [PERSON-23] So from a timeline perspective and starting of f, I expected us to come back and refine this proposal, righ t?
Agent: And to come back with an actual number for y ou instead of a rang e. This timeline for execution is less important to u s. It's all dependent on when you want t o. get started and when you want to see this val ue, so we kind of work backwards from that [PERSON-22]
Agent: But I also want to make sure I get you the information you need in order to make a business decision on [GPE-4]. So those are two questio ns.
Agent: One would be around the project, rig ht?
Agent: When would you want to get started or resource availabil ity realistical ly?
Agent: Or if we're operating on a [DATE-22] timeli ne, when do you want to see that val ue?
Agent: And then the second is, what else do you need for me in [DATE-23] to make a decision from [PERSON-21] if any besides a refin ed. number. So I want to make
EndUser: Sure I don't slow you down th ere.
EndUser: Yeah, I think a refined number is really the key to the final decision with [ORG-1], the holistic, right?
EndUser: So I think that that's going to be important. I think as far as kicking off, I mean, your dates are four [DATE-23], basically, online. I mean, I think as soon as possible.
EndUser: You know, [DATE-22], if that's even realistic, would be great. I mean,
EndUser: We especially since [DATE-21] is just discovery, I think it's going to be a lot easier to get the resources that you need. And then we can go from there. So I don't
Agent: Know what's realistic on your side. Like you said, it is people that you guys have to align and everything. But... Yeah, that is we like moving fast.
Agent: Let me check on resource availability so I can level set those expectations. We would need, obviously, approvals and agreement to say, hold these resources from middle [DATE-20] to get started.
Agent: There's a broad team here, but it's definitely not something that is out of it. I just got to make the ask and get the commitment from you all that this is something you're going to move forward with.
EndUser: So realistically, when do you hope to make a decision on sales force in general to kind of meet that timeline?
EndUser: Yeah, well, and that's probably not going to align with [DATE-23]. I think realistically, it's probably going to be [DATE-29].
Agent: Close to So, but yeah, so I mean, I think it's basically, we can, you know, I mean, this would be great to do together.
Agent: And if it's as long as directionally you feel like you're going to get there, we can line up folks, especially if there's a number and the scope, everything feels good to
EndUser: You, then we can do some things in here to get the resources aligned for the time that you want to start. Yeah, you know, and I guess I'll be the one that we're realistic.
EndUser: I mean, even if it's like [DATE-28], you know, I think that that's all good. I mean, I think the point here is that once we pull the trigger, we want it to be sitting
Agent: Around for a month here, you know, we have [ORG-1] and now what?
Agent: The sooner we can get things rolling the better. So... I always say that to folks
EndUser: Like, you know, once you've made that decision, you made that decision for a reason, you know, with [ORG-1].
EndUser: And so, don't leave them on the, don't leave the license on the table and we can work with you to, you know, get... And that's something maybe you were just about ready to go there.
EndUser: Let's assume that we pull the trigger and we got the license starting [DATE-42]. And we have everything signed with both you and [ORG-1]. Some guidance as to what we can start working
Agent: On, even if it's not making an official discovery capacity or whatever. I think would be helpful just again to start leveraging the platform in some capacity.
Agent: Yeah, happy to put together a plan for you guys so we're not waiting until final signatures. Yeah, it's definitely not atypical.
Agent: But again, we just want to make sure we're doing the right thing for you and that this is a mutual partnership. So let me go back to the team.
Agent: You know, I just in reality, we'll have to play around with it, the scope and the numbers to make sense because we do have humans on this that I got to make sure I can keep working that the numbers work, but we don't want to shortchange the actual effort.
EndUser: And
Agent: And then come back to you in [DATE-38] and be like, hey, we cut this out to make number Now we need a change order, right?
EndUser: A 429k
Agent: So I just want to have that . relationship with the first phase one. So thank you, [PERSON-20], for the time. I really appreciate it. I'll download with the team here [DATE-42] and then schedule a follow up with you.
Agent: Either at [DATE-40] or early next.
EndUser: I know there's a bank holiday [DATE-42], [DATE-28] the on this to make sure and
Agent: So it'd be latest.
Agent: I think we should re-sync
Agent: That we're refined still
Agent: Playing in the same
Agent: Field.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. Budget: The customer expressed that the estimated cost for the first phase was higher than they expected. They mentioned the need for a fixed cost, preferably at the lower end of the estimated range, to make the deal more palatable.
2. Timeline: The customer wanted to start as soon as possible, ideally before the end of [DATE-21], but they also needed to align resources and make a final decision on Salesforce, which they expect to happen by [DATE-29]. The seller mentioned they would need to check on resource availability to meet the customer's preferred timeline.
3. Validation of the deployment: The customer mentioned the need to show the value and metrics of the deployment to make a phase two more palatable. They want to ensure that the investment will yield the desired results before committing to further phases.

Answer to this question is unclear:

1. Adoption and training: Although the customer mentioned concerns about adoption and the importance of training, they did not explicitly state that this would prevent the deal from closing. The seller did mention that they have a model that focuses on adoption and user experience, which might address the customer's concerns.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""So that's kind of the format that will follow within the proposal we put together. Now pause here so we can level set again on what brought us here to this initial conversation, how the lens we view all of our projects.""
2. ""You know, last time we were on, I talked about our motion, you know, we exclusively focus on, you know, fins in the space. Right. We did that for a lot of reasons, but just to build that subject matter expertise, you know, the best practices lessons learned and, you know, this is a sweet spot for us.""
3. ""But the critical elements of that are things like adoption planning, change management, but also benchmarking KPIs and thinking about the end user experience, all that's built into how we govern and manage the solution.""
4. ""And you kind of see that as [PERSON-4] walks through it, but it's really important that we focus on delivering outcomes, not just a platform. Not just getting to a delivery date with the technology.""
5. ""And that becomes an undercurrent as we deliver. We're always thinking about that from a UI perspective, an Integration perspective, process improvement perspective.""
6. ""And then we do a lot of risk sharing deals and happy to elaborate on that, [PERSON-9], as you dig into this and you have questions later on.""
7. ""But I think it's important for the [PRODUCT-1] to have skin in the game. And that can show up a lot of different ways.""
8. ""And then we do a lot of risk sharing deals and happy to elaborate on that, [PERSON-9], as you dig into this and you have questions later on.""
9. ""But I think it's important for the [PRODUCT-1] to have skin in the game. And that can show up a lot of different ways.""
10. ""And so really what I want to hone in on is, you know, the element of what is going to, or how can we hold people accountable? What have you seen work and not work in other financial institutions as far as, you know, adaptability.""
11. ""Obviously some outcomes in terms of numbers is great, but there's also just like soft stuff. Like how many people, like how often do people log in [DATE-2] or how many transactions are actually flowing through the system?""
12. ""And so really what I want to hone in on is, you know, the element of what is going to, or how can we hold people accountable? What have you seen work and not work in other financial institutions as far as, you know, adaptability.""
13. ""And then we're going to get you that foundation so they can really centralize the business and the efforts of growing the business, nurturing the current clients and prospects so you can see the growth that you're expecting.""
14. ""And so we're here to help you, but you'll see a lot of resources, line item resources towards this project because of that.""
15. ""And then the Marketing expertise that we're going to bring to your team, which we love. They've already had a lot of exposure to [WORK_OF_ART-1] in the past life but now we're going to bring it to connect one, you're going to make it your own.""
16. ""And then there's going to be some critical integrations at the bottom that we're going to focus on [DATE-4]. The [ORG-10], connecting to email, that's where you're living [DATE-4]. But we also want to get you connected to your warehouse because that seems to be the focal point of all your data moving in the future.""
17. ""So what I want to focus on is the business value, right? What are you going to get out of this?""
18. ""And then we're going to sunset some technology that you'll have [DATE-4]? And so by centralizing all this information, we know one thing is, all right, we're going to provide you the avenue to come and look and find all the information.""
19. ""And then we're going to really focus on your Marketing team. So they're going to have integrated campaigns.""
20. ""And then they're going to be able to segment those audiences that they have based on traffic","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer seems to feel that the seller's product has the potential to meet their needs, particularly in addressing their concerns about adoption and outcome-focused solutions. However, they also express some reservations about the cost and are seeking a fixed cost for the first phase of the project. The customer appears to be interested in moving forward but needs more clarity on the financial aspects and the specifics of the proposal.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's concerns about adoption and the impact of previous failed deployments. While the rep did acknowledge the customer's concerns about adoption, they could have delved deeper into the reasons for the failure of the previous deployment and how their solution addresses those specific issues.
2. The rep could have also spent more time understanding the customer's budget and constraints. Although the customer did mention a higher-than-expected price tag, the rep could have proactively discussed pricing and payment options earlier in the conversation.
3. The rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current technology stack and integration needs. While the rep did mention integrations, they could have explored this topic in more detail to ensure a better fit between the seller's product and the customer's existing systems.
4. The rep could have inquired about the customer's timeline for implementation and whether there were any specific deadlines or milestones that needed to be met. This would have helped the rep tailor their proposal and timeline to better meet the customer's needs.
5. The rep could have asked for more specific information about the customer's key performance indicators (KPIs) and success metrics. This would have allowed the rep to better align the seller's product with the customer's goals and expectations, and provide more targeted recommendations for measuring the success of the implementation.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the data strategy and customer success services of the seller's product. They mentioned that the focus on data first and customer success is important for unlocking future value and delivering outcomes, not just a platform. They also appreciated the seller's doubled-down efforts on process and end-user experience, as well as the risk-sharing deals that the seller offers.

The customer specifically mentioned their concern about adoption and the biggest fear of losing confidence in the platform. They were interested in the seller's best practices and templates for communication plans and incentives for adoption. The customer also mentioned that they want to bake KPIs and metrics into the deployment process to ensure early success and avoid waiting too long to figure out if the system is being used.

Overall, the customer seemed to be excited about the potential for the seller's product to improve adoption, end-user experience, and process improvement, as well as the seller's commitment to delivering outcomes and sharing risk.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person if they were not. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The sales representative plans to download with their team and schedule a follow-up, but there is no mention of what will be discussed or decided during that follow-up.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call appears to be cautiously optimistic. They express that the proposed cost is higher than they expected, but they are interested in the solution and want to present it to their CEO, president, and CFO. They emphasize the need for a fixed cost and mention that a lower cost would make the decision easier. They also express a desire to get started as soon as possible, ideally by [DATE-22], and to see value quickly. However, they realistically expect to make a decision by [DATE-29]. Overall, while the customer has some concerns about the cost, they seem open to moving forward with the deal if their requirements are met.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""How have you seen work and not work in other financial institutions as far as adaptability?"" The customer seemed more engaged as they asked follow-up questions about specific metrics and outcomes.
2. ""How many people, like how often do people log in [DATE-2] or how many transactions are actually flowing through the system?"" The customer showed interest in these details, indicating they were considering the practical implications of the product.
3. ""What have you seen work and not work in other financial institutions as far as, you know, adaptability?"" The customer seemed more engaged as they asked follow-up questions about specific metrics and outcomes.

Note: The transcript has repetitive questions, and the customer showed engagement in all instances. However, I've only listed each unique question once.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of their company's product throughout the call. They emphasized the importance of data-first strategy, customer success, and delivering outcomes rather than just a platform. They also highlighted their focus on adoption planning, change management, and end-user experience. The rep also mentioned their risk-sharing deals and commitment to making a partnership with the customer. However, there were a few instances where the rep could have further emphasized the value proposition:

1. When discussing the phased approach, the rep could have provided specific examples of how the customer would benefit from each phase. While they did mention the benefits of phase one, they could have elaborated more on how the customer's needs and pain points would be addressed in each phase.
2. The rep could have provided more concrete examples of how their product has helped other financial institutions with similar challenges. While they did mention some success stories, they could have gone into more detail to demonstrate their expertise and experience in the industry.
3. The rep could have emphasized more on how their product would help the customer achieve their specific goals and objectives. While they did touch upon this topic, they could have delved deeper into the customer's unique needs and challenges to demonstrate how their product would provide a customized solution.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of their product, but there were a few areas where they could have provided more specific and concrete examples to further demonstrate the benefits to the customer.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were related to adoption and the fear of a repeat of a previous failed deployment. The customer emphasized the importance of end-user adoption, mentioning it multiple times during the conversation. They were worried about the platform not being used and losing end-user confidence, as had happened in the past. The customer also wanted to ensure that the deployment process was smooth and that end-users were well-informed about the value and impact of the new platform on their work."

Agent: Right, awesome.
Agent: Cj, is there anybody else on your end?
Agent: I don't know if [PERSON-1] was going to be joining.
Speaker 7: We definitely want [PERSON-1], so let's give it one more second.
Agent: Sure.
Speaker 7: And if not, I might have to go knock on his window.
Agent: Are you sending
EndUser: Him a message?
EndUser: I was about to do the same, but we don't I did it.
Speaker 7: Have to. Yeah, I just did the same.
EndUser: So I saw I thought I saw you typing. So I was like, [PERSON-2], I'll just, I'll wait.
Agent: So, [PERSON-3], are you done in [GPE-1] [DATE-1] or up in [GPE-2]?
EndUser: I am up in [GPE-3]. So I'm going to Thanks, [ORG-1].
Speaker 7: Go check on him really fast guys.
EndUser: I have moved back to [LOC-1], and I ended up buying a house in [GPE-3]. So,
Agent: Okay. I have a house. Nice.
Agent: How long ago did that happen?
EndUser: So I moved back at, In [DATE-2] and I ended up buying the house in [DATE-3] and we've been here ever since.
Agent: Very nice. You got one of the most perfect places for fall weather. Love [GPE-3] and fall. It's just like gorgeous.
EndUser: Oh yeah, it's beautiful up here, but I will say my. I don't know. I don't know what the phrase is, but my blood thinner now. I get colder easier than when I first used to again.
Speaker 7: I threw things at his door. So I think he was in the middle of bridge tournament if I'm not mistaken. So I think he's just finishing up.
Agent: Going up to [GPE-3] and [GPE-4] was one of the typical things we did when we were up in [GPE-2] many moons ago [WORK_OF_ART-1] it.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm growing up my family. We went to [LOC-2] every summer, so ending up somewhere between [GPE-5] and [GPE-4] was kind of
Speaker 7: Always in the cards for me. I get to actually go to [ORG-2] and do a baseball game there.
EndUser: That was awesome. Oh yeah, one of the best stadiums,
Speaker 7: One of the best ballparks you can find in the world. You know what's funny coming from coming from the [ORG-3] and [FAC-1] and all that, what's so magical about it is everything's just like right there.
Speaker 7: You go into that area and it's like it's all connected and anyway. Welcome [PERSON-1].
EndUser: [ORG-4].
Agent: And muted
Speaker 7: And muted. [ORG-4]
EndUser: And muted. I haven't used hello, everyone. Sorry, do I haven't used [ORG-5] neat and hot minute. So it's all fun. Yeah, yeah.
Agent: So I'm with you. Thank you for the. I going to cut you any [ORG-6] on that one, though.
Speaker 7: Don't. I don't think he's just
EndUser: [PERSON-1], even for a second.
Agent: Well, you know,
EndUser: We are [ORG-7]. Sure.
EndUser: I don't go.
EndUser: Know. There we
EndUser: It's just me.
Speaker 7: What we sell. Okay. Thank you for all joining [DATE-4].
Speaker 7: And certainly [PERSON-1], if you want to kick off kind of what we're here to do and what the goal is with your group as it pertains to Marketing in [DATE-5] and how we can learn more about
EndUser: Part out and how that aligns with your vision. Yeah, excellent. Thanks so much. So I joined [ORG-8] from [ORG-9], you know, [DATE-6].
EndUser: [PERSON-3] is our unbelievable resource who's been leading the charge on what we need on the [PERSON-4] stack and I'll let [PERSON-3] talk a little bit more in detail on that.
EndUser: And the history of what we've done was [ORG-10], right?
EndUser: I know many of you are up to speed on that but we should at least touch base on where we've gone in the past.
EndUser: We absolutely need a Marketing automated platform, right?
EndUser: Whether that's got a serum component or, you know, we need it. And we are struggling on and down. We're just simply unable to reach the right audience.
EndUser: Program, right?
EndUser: And this is probably music to all of your [DATE-7]. You must hear this all the time. So, but yeah, we're there.
EndUser: We've really been successful in driving revenues throughout the, you know, [PERSON-3] runs a really robust paid media program. And that's honestly the way we've been driving the lion's share of our product sales to this point.
EndUser: But yeah, we're ready for the next evolution. And, you know, we're working on so many different We're extremely grateful to bring this to life, but this is in our top two priorities.
EndUser: You know, we've got to sort this and we need it fast.
Agent: So we're moving quick and I appreciate you guys jumping on the call with us. Yeah, of course [PERSON-1]. And I will preface this. I had emailed [ORG-10]. Trust-a-tech still has [PRODUCT-1] and part-out.
EndUser: You guys purchased that
Agent: Back in [DATE-8]. It just was not implemented. I know that you had said that potentially it was swapped out for some licenses, but there's no record of that on my end. I talked to the team.
Agent: I talked to [PERSON-5], [PERSON-1], I don't know if you were with [ORG-8] when [PERSON-5] was here, but he was the previous accounting executive. And I guess I'll start. I'll start.
Agent: With just the introduction because [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-1], I actually haven't met you [ORG-10] actually as well, this is the first time talking, but it's good to meet you guys My name is [PERSON-6] I've been with [ORG-10] for [DATE-9] I took over for [PERSON-7] for trusted tech So I'll be the main point of contact and AE for you guys here at [ORG-10] So should you need anything, even if it's a simple resource that you can't find, pleas e feel free to reach out to me .
Agent: But back to my previous note, yeah, there's absolutely no record of any swap of licenses. So you guys are still paying for it. It's just not live and it was never implemented.
Agent: So this is something that you currently have. I don't know if it makes sense to look at [ORG-11]. You're more than welcome to, but you have this through
EndUser: [DATE-10]. That's when your contract up.
Agent: Is
EndUser: Great. Thanks for
Speaker 7: Clarifying. Yeah. So you're saying we don't need to go across the street to [ORG-10].
Agent: We have a past [ORG-10] that's in front of us.
Speaker 7: Essentially. Yeah. Got it. Okay. But [PERSON-6], that all almost no one on this call even knows that and knows anything about [GPE-6].
Agent: [PERSON-8],
Speaker 7: So I think the real thing we need to get out of this call really is how, I mean, and once again, I don't want to speak for you, [PERSON-1].
Speaker 7: But I think we're pretty far down the line in terms of trying to evaluate [ORG-11]. I know [PERSON-3] was in some of the discussions with Pardot at the get go.
Speaker 7: I know that didn't maybe go as well as it could have. And that may have been internal resources. It could have been effort.
Speaker 7: It could have been lots of things, but that kind of maybe didn't go as well as it could have. That said, there's a huge need, which is why on evaluating [ORG-11].
Agent: We kind of jumped
Speaker 7: And that certainly speaks really well to people who are in Marketing groups. But we're also on a platform that's all [ORG-10] and [PRODUCT-2] and all of that and all the integration.
Speaker 7: So what we really love to get out of this call would be super high level, help us understand what it is with the platform that we're going to get and how that's going to meet our needs.
Speaker 7: And quite honestly, to be frank, why is it
Agent: Superior to what we would get with trying to do it in HubSpot?
Speaker 7: Yeah,
Agent: Sure thing, and that's kind of what we have outlined for [DATE-4]. [PERSON-9] is going to take you through kind of like a high level demonstration of [PRODUCT-1] and part dot or question to say part dot.
Agent: And it's going to be exactly your addition. So this is everything that you're paying for. We're going to show you what you have. I don't know if you have any questions beforehand before I kick it off to [PERSON-9].
Agent: I know we have [TIME-1], but if not, then I'll kick it off to her and we can jump right into the demo.
EndUser: And of course, we'll answer questions along the way. I'd like to counter if it's okay, you know, give me the floor here too. You've been so deeply involved and you are really up to speed on this whole time.
EndUser: I mean, is there anything you want to layer in here that we make sure we're
EndUser: Getting out of the conversation [DATE-4]?
EndUser: Oh, I mean. So I think what you guys are going to cover is probably going to be right in line with what we're looking for. But really, we need robust campaign management tools across our Marketing efforts.
EndUser: We need to make sure that everything is integrated with our outbound sales motion. We want to enhance our Lead Scoring and lead management process, event tracking and logging, customer journey mapping, and we need robust reporting analytics, of course.
EndUser: Obviously, the email Marketing program is going to go directly into that campaign management piece. Social media management is also going to be out.
EndUser: A big part of this landing page creation and different forms set up That's another important aspect that we're going to be looking for . So yeah, I mean,
EndUser: I'll pepper you guys with questions
Agent: As I have them, but that's kind of the high level. Alright, thank you.
Agent: Awesome. Perfect, I will kick it off to [PERSON-9]. Perfect. And again, everything I'm showing you here [DATE-4] from the part outside is the addition that you have [DATE-4].
Agent: You currently have access to the part out advanced edition, just so you know, the name has changed from part out to [PRODUCT-1] account engagement. So that might be where some of the confusion lies as well.
Agent: Same baseline platform, but some additional functionality as well as just being on top of your [ORG-10] lightning platform. And then in addition to the Account Engagement slash product too l that I'll be showing you [DATE-4] .
Agent: Do also have access to our premier success , is for sort of ongoing one-on-one coaching sessions . course, [PERSON-10] and his team are also available her e to help get that initial Implementation and everything set up .
Agent: Think that they were part of the conversatio n earlier in [DATE-10] .
Agent: Then outside of the [ORG-14] platform , also have two other [PRODUCT-1] products as well to really help with that outbound effort s, make sure that you can do things like find local-like audience s, if someone's not engaging, we can pull in a targeted ad to them, et [PERSON-10]: And then you also have our additional analytics to ol called [ORG-11] So you have quite a breadth of functionality across the boar d. [DATE-11], we're going to be focusing on the [ORG-14] part outsid e, which is really sort of the main engine for your Marketing automatio n. It's where you can come in and do things like [PERSON-11] like lead scoring, lead nurturing, customer journe ys, build landing pages, forms, emai ls, track how those people move through your [GPE-7], understand engagement, and then you'll also have [ORG-11] ess to [PRODUCT-3] features and functionality for both Marketing and sales directly here in Account Engagement t oo.
Agent: [PERSON-6], I'm sure can send over sort of the full [ORG-21] own of that contract that you have with [ORG-25].
Agent: I'm on the solution engineering [ORG-21], so I don't have access to all of those numbers or anythi ng, but just wanted to preface th at, but you do really have to.
Agent: Have a very flexible way of using all of the Marketing Cloud products here at [ORG-10] [DATE-4] that you have avail able to you at this moment in t ime.
Agent: Any questions on that before we kind of get into the platform itself, we'll just treat this like this is everyone's first time seeing it, like you don't have the tools so we can keep it super conversational, but just wanted to get that out of the way as well that you have more what I'll be showing you here [DATE-4].
EndUser: Functionality in addition to
Agent: I think we're good to get going. Perfect. Awesome. So as we're going through, please feel free to ask questions. You can put them in the chat. Use the hand raise emoji. Come off mute. Love you.
Agent: You want to ask, but I'll make sure to pause too so we can kind of dive into anything that's specific to you. Here we are in the [ORG-14] platform. Again, we went through a name change.
Agent: So this used to be known as part op, but now it is [PRODUCT-1] account engagement.
Agent: The focus of [ORG-14] is to really align your B2B Marketing efforts so that you have that close direct alignment between your Marketing sales.
Agent: And service It allows you to really execute on thing s like an account-based Marketing program but also still dive into what's happenin g at the individual level You'll have out of the box reporting [PERSON-10] y to understand how key accounts are engaging how individuals are engaging and how this directly impacts ROI and attribution The great thing too is that it is very easy to lear n and to use, as you can see we are built here on top of the Lightning platform So it's that same UI that you're familiar wit h from your [ORG-10] CRM I can see it switch back and forth between Marketing and [PERSON-10] or any of my other sales force tool s. And perhaps most importantly to o, I'm going to have access to all of those key data poin ts across Marketing sales and service like lead s, contacts, accounts, opportunities, campaign s. I'll also have access to all of those defau lt and custom field s. I can really make sure that I have that single sour ce of truth because if something happens on the CRM sid e, that can reflect here in the Marketing side and vice vers a. you're never gonna have to worry about things being out of date or hitting API limits beca use again, we're on the lightning platform.
Speaker 7: So those things are not something you're go ing to have to be concerned wi th. Okay [PERSON-9], can I, quick question, when you say you're on the lightning platform, it's my understanding that it doesn't exist, like
Agent: The other pieces of the lightning platform.
Speaker 7: Can you clarify that maybe at the end a bit?
Speaker 7: Sure.
Speaker 7: Can you ask that question again though?
Speaker 7: Well what I mean by that is it's not, it's not part of the standard API. So if I do an API query into accounts, contacts, etc. It's my understanding that this part of it is somewhere
Agent: Else, or is what you're showing us actually part of the standard API. Got it. OK, from an API perspective, there is a unique [ORG-19] that you would use.
Agent: The API though is white labeled so that it would not count towards any of your [ORG-10] API limits.
Agent: Like if you were using a [ORG-23] or a [ORG-11] or an [GPE-8], those you would have to one monitor your API access.
Agent: But two as well, we do use the same campaign object, the same lead object, the same account object, same opportunity object across Marketing and sales. But the API itself the Salesforce API .
Speaker 7: Is unique to account. engagement versus
Agent: Okay, I'll follow up with this game of question on that later. So, thanks. Perfect. Awesome.
Agent: Let's talk about sort of the data side here in account engagement, just a little bit to give you an idea and an understanding of data points that you can use. Again, we have those leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities, campaigns.
Agent: Of course, we have all of those just sort of standard default fields that you're probably already tracking from your [PRODUCT-4] side, as well as any custom fields too. And then we're tracking all of the different Marketing activities too.
Agent: So here, as you can see, with in account engagement, you can create and then monitor interactions on forms.
Agent: Your website, landing pages, social posts for [ORG-25] and [ORG-19], email, you can pull in as well Third-party data points, like if you are doing a bunch of webinars through Zoom you can actually pull in that information directly here to monitor who has registered or attended a Zoom webinar We also have other prebuilt integrations to tools like Eventbrite I know you mentioned events was an important portion of your Marketing efforts Or, again, you can also even create your own Content own sort of third-party integrations, a common one, might be if you have a proprietar y. and you want to monitor people logging in or interacting, that can also be part of these prospect activities that we're tracking, which go into that overall engagement score.
Agent: So I'll talk about that in a second. Any questions, though, on the activity types that you have available here in account engagement, we'll definitely talk a little bit more about building some of that Content a little later on.
EndUser: Would activities like
Agent: Outbound sales activities like email sent from sales cloud?
Agent: Would that be logged in here too?
Agent: Yeah, good question. So we can absolutely monitor those interactions. So if sales sends out something and that's tracked in the [PRODUCT-4] side or if sales schedules a meeting or sales, does a demo, all of that can be tracked.
Agent: The prospect activities of what you're seeing here specific to Marketing activities though, but that data does flow freely across Marketing and sales.
EndUser: So you can use that in conjunction information and the Marketing
Agent: With both the sales information.
Agent: Would I be able to find a unified view of those activities?
Agent: Okay, cool. So here, for example, on the sales side, this is a view specific to Marketing here directly in the [ORG-14] platform. You probably wouldn't be looking at this too much.
Agent: The reason why I like to show it is because we'll talk about the scoring and the customization here in a second. But for example, here, we're looking at that same lead, [PERSON-14]. I can see both his Marketing activity.
Agent: So everything that he's done from the Marketing side, I can drill into specifics as well as I can see any sales. activities here too.
Agent: Let's see if there's any so I can see sort of that conversation happenin g between on the Marketing front
EndUser: What's going and what's going on the sales front .
Agent: Awesome. I like that they're separated and you can see a mutify. Yes. Absolutely.
Agent: It's nice because that way sales doesn't get confused when they see that a webinar invite has gone out and they're thinking, wait, did I send that?
Agent: No, it's very clear what Marketing has been up to, very clear what sales has been up to, but can still use that data to really see that full customer journey and that customer experience.
Agent: Back to though, the scoring side of things, it sounds like Lead Scoring is also top of mind for you all. When it comes to Lead Scoring with your addition, we actually have two different types of scores .
Agent: Have our rule-based scoring, which I'll talk about first, but we also have our [ORG-28] AI scoring as well . can use either . can use both .
Agent: Have lots of customers who use both, and that's something that [PERSON-10] and his team ca n really help flesh out of us too . what might be the best path forward for your specific goals and needs.
Agent: Let's talk about that rule-based scoring first. So we offer an out-of-the-box scoring model that you can absolutely customize as much as you like.
Agent: So for example, here if someone fills out a form that's worth 52 points, if someone views a website, that's worth one point, but maybe someone requests a demo.
Agent: Instead of the normal out-of-the-box 34 points, you want to change that to be worth [DATE-10]. However, you want to set up that scoring model is completely flexible and you can change it at any point.
Agent: But when we're tracking all of those different interactions that goes into our overall engagement score So here, as you can see, [PERSON-14] has an overall score of 317 We can use this to understand [PERSON-14]'s interests and intent and then decide, hey, if someone has that certain score we'll pass them over to the sales tea m as a Marketing qualified lead Sales also has access to this [ORG-33] e so they can create reports around this call down lists, et cetera And in addition to understanding someone's behavior we're paying attention to who somebody is when it's from a demographic [ORG-33] So this is your ideal person a.
Agent: You can again set this up to be specific to your busines s, whether it be based off of where is someone locate d?
Agent: What is their job titl e?
Agent: What is their budge t?
Agent: What is their company siz e?
Agent: Any of those features we will give everyone in your databa se a grade A through F. So alongside that [ORG-33] e, we can make sure that we're also passing over individua ls who are decision makers and [ORG-28] d. So I'll pause ther e. That's that rule based scoring and [PERSON-11] flexible and customizabl e. available out of the box right from [DATE-10].
Agent: Any questions on that side of things w ith the scoring proce ss?
Speaker 7: Would Einstein consider external sources?
Speaker 7: For instance, if we did Zoom info in [GPE-9],
Speaker 7: Basically is an enrichment piece to records, would they consider that as well?
Agent: Great question. So the short answer is that we'll talk about [PERSON-11] now because I think that's a good transition. [PERSON-11] is going to sort of take the guesswork out of the equation for you.
Agent: So if you are using a tool like zoom info and that information is flowing directly into your sales force instance.
Agent: [PERSON-11] would be able to see that information, use that information, but what [PERSON-11] does is look at all of your data, look at your historical success, look at what didn't work, and constantly make updates, constantly make changes based off of your specific [ORG-10] instance.
Agent: So this is something that's going to be unique to you, constantly changing, but it would be able to pull in again, if you're using something like Zoom info for data supplements, and that's pulled into the [PRODUCT-4], we would absolutely be able to see that.
Agent: So for example here, we have a- similar breakdown of that behavior score and that demographic score with our [ORG-33] n scoring models here. Here, we're taking a look at who is this person. Again, we're lookin g at [PERSON-14].
Agent: We can see his lead score, which is paying attention to specific attributes abou t [PERSON-14]. For example, in this case, he's located in the [GPE-10].
Agent: He has a VP as his title, but h e came in through a cold call.
Agent: So again, [ORG-10], this could be a lead source, came in fro m Zoom info, or you could have found that he's a VP from a Zoom info information upload.
Agent: The nice thing about these scores as well is that when we were looki ng at [PERSON-14] before, his score can get pretty high, you know, 506, that's not crazy.
Agent: But [PERSON-21] es you might have someone who's super engaged who has a score of, you know, like a thousa nd because it's just racking up points.
Agent: Since these scores are always going to be out of 78, very easy and digestible to use, very universal as well.
Agent: So it sort of [PERSON-25] some of those massive scores and it's weighing also the time that someone's engaging. So if someone is. particularly active [DATE-14], that will increase their [ORG-33] re.
Agent: But if they start to fade off, [PERSON-11] will automatica lly decrease their score as we ll.
Agent: And in addition to paying attention to those speci fic attributes, we're also paying attention to every individua l's behavior, looking at things like if someone's attending even ts, if somebody is interacting with your websi te, if someone's opening emails, if somebody is going to y our specific forms on your site as we ll.
Agent: And it gives those reasons w hy. Someone is. scored that specific way.
Agent: Again, really helpful both from a Marketing perspective as well as for your sales team because they know, okay, I should definitely reach out to [PERSON-14] because he's really fi t in the bill and I can see exactly why I need to reach out to him too.
Agent: So you have both of those options from a scoring perspective, the rule-based and [PRODUCT-3]-based [ORG-33] ing. I'll pause here though. We'd love to get any feedback.
Agent: Again, this is something that's so helpful on being on that lightning platform and having that same lead, that same contact data we can really dive into
EndUser: Across your organization, so that this from that [PRODUCT-3] side of things. Hey [PERSON-9], one question from my side. Sure. Can we define what measures are that the supporting
Agent: What we think really helps influence what that number is. Yeah, good question. So for the lead score, you can tell [PERSON-11] pay attention to certain attributes or ignore certain attributes.
Agent: The behavior score, though, we really want to take that sort of human bias out of it because you might not realize how big of an influence a specific form or landing page or email or type of engagement has on someone's interest and success.
Agent: So there is some customization available here with the Lead Score and telling [PERSON-11] to pay more or less attention to certain fields. But the behavior score is pretty much stagnant in terms of the flexibility there.
EndUser: Of course, you still have access though to tha t rule-based scoring and grading which you can customize as much as you would like . So the behavior score then is really a metric that's defined by self-force.
Agent: And does that allow us kind of some benchmarking across the industry?
Agent: Yeah, so what the behavior score is looking at is again, your specific data.
Agent: So paying attention to the different leads and contacts in your database and seeing did these individuals or similar individuals who interacted with the same assets move through a deal cycle that closed or did they not.
Agent: So that's why it's unique to your business. It's again based off of your data, the [ORG-50] that you've created and what happens when an individual goes through a deal process with you all. And so that's why it's not.
Agent: Specifically defined uniquely by sales force, but it's defined by your data And so it's going to be unique to your business, unique to your process And it will constantly change over time as well, depending on different
EndUser: Assets that you create different audiences that you go after, and how your deal cycles just adjust naturally to . I understand your point. Is there a So how do I get a behavior score that's on
Agent: Average across all of our customers?
EndUser: How do you see the behavior score on average across all your customers?
EndUser: Let me refer to this.
EndUser: Can I use the behavior score to get some sort of view into our customers?
Agent: Holistically
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: I need a metric
Agent: That this spans our entire customer base.
Agent: Yes, so you can use the behavior score to one create reports to say, hey, like let's target everybody who has a behavior score above [DATE-11], have that be sort of your hot target list that whether you use on the Marketing side or on the sales side.
Agent: You also will have this behavior score dashboard that you can use to kind of see what different types of behaviors directly influence the score itself, which we can talk about a little bit as well.
Agent: But you'll also have in addition to individual scores, you'll also have the iNc. time tiering for the account level too So that way if you want to focus on more of an [ORG-37] approach now we're not just looking at an individual but we're looking at the account as a whol e where similarly we are tiering the account s and providing insights as to why an account is tiere d and A through D, as well as giving you insight s into how likely is this account going to conver t in [DATE-11] So too if you want more of a broader look .
EndUser: Very helpful from that standpoint Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: And is [ORG-36] part of the strategy that you have all moving forward for your Marketing or you focused more on a one two
EndUser: One approach for your Marketing efforts?
EndUser: Oh, it's definitely going to be a count base. There are two main stakeholders
Agent: That are involved that will need to influence all of them. Perfect. Love to hear that. Yeah. Again, it's in the name, account engagement. Our focus here really is on that [ORG-31] approach.
Agent: So again, with the [PERSON-11] tiering, we're paying attention to the account level. And then of course, you can dive into individual contacts of that account to see how they're interacting, how they're performing.
Agent: And as mentioned too, what's really great about this is that it provides that insight into how likely an account is to convert.
Agent: So for the sales team, they might have 10 tier A accounts, but they can go into those 10 tier.
Agent: A accounts and C. I have three of these accounts that are most likely to convert within [EVENT-1]. I'm going to spend my time focusing on those, making sure I'm really hitting those hard .
Agent: And then still engaging with the other tier A, maybe some of the tier B, but really not even bother with those tier D at this moment.
Agent: So it gives you that insight from both the Marketing perspective as well as for
EndUser: The sales team to use directly.
EndUser: How long do we need to have data collection happening through Marketing Cloud in order to get these insights?
EndUser: I'm just looking at it and it says, based on six dates in the lower country, we came to [GPE-10] from [DATE-21] through [DATE-25]. So it sounds like it's referencing previous data collection
Agent: To make inferences about current prospects. So I'm just curious about that. Yes, great question.
Agent: And so there is a variety of different [PERSON-11] features that you do have access to, I should say [DATE-4], like the account insights, like the behavior and lead score, as well as some other features that we'll talk through [DATE-4] too.
Agent: Those different features do have different data requirements. The average that I like to give though is [DATE-21] worth of [ORG-10] data.
Agent: So since you are current [ORG-10] customers, a lot of this data you'll have right out of the gate. And then again, it's constant.
Agent: Constantly changing So as you start creating assets here in [ORG-14] start doing webinars that you're [PERSON-21] through account engagement, all of those different Marketing specific data points to, that is somethin g that [PERSON-11] will notice, start paying attention to But I can send you over all of the specific dat a requirements The short answer is those that you'll [ORG-50] y have a leg up as your current [ORG-10] customers And you've been [ORG-10]
EndUser: Customer s for longer than
Speaker 7: [DATE-19] . Awesome.
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-9],
Speaker 7: Just, just how I totally understand this. So let's say we have a lead, they go to a webinar.
Speaker 7: Their Lead Score jumps up to 44, right?
Speaker 7: Because they've just attended it. We would expect them to be at 57 [DATE-4], but over time, if they do absolutely nothing, we would expect that to
Agent: Kind of some kind of progression down to zero. Correct. Correct, exactly. So [PERSON-11] is looking at both how active someone is and then also active, their score will
Speaker 7: If someone is not
EndUser: Go down. Thank you. Yep. Great question though. Can we apply that decay model to event
Agent: Our based scoring, our manual score?
Agent: Yes. You absolutely can also do that to the rule based scoring too. So you can also have it the hey, if.
Agent: Somebody goes on and updates their managed preference form that will also decrease their score, but you can have it be a time-based score decrease as well. Again, that's something that you can control that we're seeing here.
EndUser: On the rule-based score in front [EVENT-2].
Agent: All great questions. Let's talk a little bit about using this data. We've talked a little bit about some of the key ways that you might want to use it.
Agent: But another obvious way is through the Marketing side specifically, and that's with dynamic segmentation lists. So this is probably something pretty straightforward and standard for most of you.
Agent: But I think that it's an important portion to just understand, again, how we can use all of these different data points across Marketing and sales.
Agent: Since these are rule-based lists, it's a great way to always have an updated audience that you can use, whether it be for a way.
Agent: One-off send for a long-term nurture program However, you want to engage with these different audiences You'll have access to tons of different data points across Marketing and sales like default and custom fields, account information information from Marketing like landing pages or form fill outs score information as well as to what's happening from the opportunity side even So for example, in this case we're targeting anybody in [GPE-11] [GPE-10] who's in a current opportunity stage You know, there is - in that initial discovery stag e. So maybe we send over some specific [ORG-50] that's going to really [PERSON-19] te or invite those people to an even t, but we can also come in and pull in account informati on like that [PERSON-11] account ti like that we were just taking a look a t. So now we'll only be targeting tier A and tier B accounts too to really help emphasi ze that [ORG-31] approach that it sounds [PERSON-23] is a big focus for you [PERSON-25] Now this also will work with the advertising stud io that you also have access t o. to [DATE-4] so you can use this to push look-alike [GPE-10] ces over to the advertising studio side of thin gs, making sure that then you can find similar [PRODUCT-5], similar individuals to send those targeted ads to get them back into the funnel as we ll.
Agent: But the possibilities here are endl ess from the list side of thin gs. Just always like to touch on it. Any questions here, I'm building out these different ty [PERSON-19] of lists or audiences that you
EndUser: Would like to focus on.
EndUser: I think you kind of implied it with the ad studio, but I just want to ask it. directly one more time.
Agent: So can we have do the list creation here and then type that audience list into our different [ORG-5] Ads, [ORG-7] Ads?
EndUser: Ad platforms, [ORG-19],
Agent: So yes, you can push it into the use that to push it to your various ad platforms.
EndUser: Advertising studio side of things and then Awesome.
Agent: Great. Let's talk about just quickly the [ORG-50] creation side of things. And then we'll talk about we have our audience, we have our content, how do we want to engage and move someone through that funnel.
Agent: When it comes to the [ORG-50] building, we offer a variety of different types of Content that you can create, forms, landing pages, social posts.
Agent: We do also integrate with [ORG-5] Ads and [ORG-37], too, if you want to have some of that direct conversation right here in the [ORG-14] platform. And then when it comes to the user.
Agent: Building aspect itself, lots of different option s to really work with your comfort level This is our drag and drop email builder It looks pretty much identical for landing pages So the biggest difference is that it would be horizonta l instead of vertical But we do also offer out of the box templates you can us e to kind of just get things started Or we even offer full HTML if you want to do somethin g completely customized as well I like the drag and drop builder because it offer s sort of that happy medium where I can and have my own framework still acce ss some of those additional functionalitie s, like HTML directly in these message s, but don't have to Code an entire message mysel f. If you've ever used a Wig Builde r, this is going to feel very familia r. I have my different columns her e, which act as my [NORP-1] k, and then I can pull in buttons, HTML, image s, and text directly into these message s. I also have access again to any merge fiel ds across my organization that I might want to us e, whether it be first name, last nam e, services someone might be using, who their account manager is, e tc.
Agent: And one great feature that you're going to have access to as well that's com ing out on [DATE-23], I belie ve. is our Einstein [ORG-37] content.
Agent: So you'll actually be able to use [PERSON-11] to help you create [ORG-50] for emails, subject lines, landing pages, really beneficial and time-saving just to give you some of those additional supports on actually creating content, using your data and not having to upload things into, for example, chat [ORG-37], where then it becomes public.
Agent: Now you can keep all of that information private, unique to your business, and again, specific to what's in your system.
Agent: [ORG-10] database I saw a question pop up in the cha t while I'm taking a look at that Anything else ?
EndUser: I assume we can drop in our brand colors into the style tab and that'll automatically populate within the prebuilt elements so we can just have our brand style on the prebuilt templates
Agent: Or is that a bad assumption?
Agent: So you can absolutely create sort of a template like this drag and drop builder here with your branding with your colors and then have that be sort of your norm.
Agent: For example, I'm using just a baseline newsletter template here that has the pre built header the footer the background the colors, etc.
Agent: So you do have that, but it would not be sort of the same flexibility like you're mentioning where you just pull in specifically your brand colors into this view.
Agent: And then [ORG-10] you asked, and what are you showing the audience could be a lead or contact?
Agent: Yes, correct. So for the merge fields here, it takes a look at both leads, contacts, and account information. So it can work across all of those different objects and pulls that data respectively.
Agent: If it is a lead, it will pull from the lead side. If it's from a contact, it will pull from Thank you.
Speaker 7: The contact side, et cetera.
Agent: Great question.
Agent: Anything else on the [ORG-50] side of things, building content, creating content?
Agent: No?
Agent: Thanks, sir. OK, well, I do really want to talk about the journey side. One quick thing from an Einstein perspective, though, is that you do have Send Time Optimization available for sort of one-off emails.
Agent: So that if I have an important message like a webinar or upcoming features and functionality that I really want to make sure everyone's engaging with, I can do a one-off send where I allow [PERSON-11] to look at historically when is every individual prospect on this list most likely to engage?
Agent: [PERSON-11] will then. send those messages specifically for each individual So for example, I am on [LOC-3] . If you sent me a message at [TIME-2] time, probably wouldn't engage with it right away.
Agent: Whereas if you sent [PERSON-11] might notice, hey, [PERSON-9] likes to open her messages at [TIME-3] on the [LOC-4] side of things, it will send me that message at that time without you having to update anything.
Agent: This can really help with things like throttling as well if you're sending to a bunch of people at a specific company. You don't have to worry about hitting those spam blockers.
Agent: And two can just really help with the overall engagement effort.
Agent: Making sure that those top-of-mind messages are getting to the right peopl e and that they actually have a chance to interact with them But for those more detailed journeys that's what we have here with our engagement studio program Let me just zoom out a little bit .
Agent: This is where you can come in and create sort of that traditional decision tree look and feel providing a customer or a lead journey. First off, you can choose exactly who you want to send to.
Agent: You can send to multiple lists and you can also have suppression lists here too so that way you don't have to worry about cross-contamination or anything like that.
Agent: Of course, you have control over when these messages go out and then we have a variety of different ways to interact.
Agent: We have actions which are doing things, simple options like sending out emails, but also aligning to the sales process doing things like assigning a new lead to the right team [PERSON-28] r based off of rules set up in the [PRODUCT-4], creating a sales force [PERSON-33] k so the team knows they need to follow up or even making quick one-off adjustment s to the scoring model right here, whether it be a positive or negative approach So you can even do that right here on the fly In addition to those actions, we have triggers, which is paying attentio n to those behaviors So did someone click an email fill out a form, view a landing page, and you can even pull in third party triggers in to this as well.
Agent: Again, that Zoom webinar one is a common one. So if someone registers or attends a Zoom
EndUser: Webinar, how do we want to guide that journey?
EndUser: Go ahead, [PERSON-33], if y ou want to ask something sort of relevant to thi s. Yeah, I have a quick question.
EndUser: How does this work with our Sales Engagement cadence?
EndUser: Does it get connected with the cadence, or is it a totally separate two system with the amount of [ORG-44] and sales engagement?
Agent: Good question. So this is completely separate from sales engagement. That focus is more on obviously for the sales teams directly.
Agent: Oftentimes we see teams using sales engagement, either one for active deal cycles where maybe you want to really make sure that you're nurturing those leads correctly as they're going through your actual deal conversations.
Agent: But your team doesn't want to have to worry about sending every sort of asset that they need to, or two for those times once the Account Engagement platform.
Agent: Has qualified that lead, but we're not in an active deal cycle yet, that's really where [ORG-46] comes into play.
Agent: Sales engagement and [ORG-14] work very well together Again, that's something that [PERSON-10] and his team can sort of talk through from a strategi c perspective for your specific business on what might make the most sense.
Agent: But I think that th e most common way that I see customers using it is again, [ORG-14] acts as that sort o f initial filter, qualifying people, making sure that they're a good fit.
Agent: And once they're showin g that interest, that engagement .
Agent: Have that [PERSON-11] score, we'll pass them over to the sales tea m, where then it can go into a [ORG-46] progra m, and then sort of continue that process moving forward as [PERSON-28] answer your question, [PERSON-33]?
EndUser: L. Does that help Any follow up ther
Agent: E?
Agent: That's it. I understand. Thank you for that. Explain that.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. [PERSON-33] is a pro at
EndUser: A sales engagement.
Agent: Awesome. I'm glad you're not yet forgetting there. I mean, the good thing about this is that, again, it has a very similar sort of look and feel to flow or sales engagement.
Agent: So it's a really easy process to learn again. So I mean, his team will absolutely be able to help you set some of these programs up directly.
Agent: But again, you can also have it say, hey, since we can pay attention to all of the data across Marketing and sales, if someone is in an active [ORG-46] program, let's actually suppress them from receiving [ORG-14] messages.
Agent: That way we don't have to. like we're overwhelming someone either or sending sort of duplicate efforts if there might be simila r Messaging across those conversations.
Agent: Again, that's where this rule information comes in all of those different data points like default and custom fields, that behavior grade, tha t excuse me, behavior score or demographic grade, as
Speaker 7: Well as where someone in th e campaign, what is this person's sales for status, etc.
Speaker 7: Hey, [PERSON-33], did I hear that right?
Speaker 7: So i f If [PERSON-33] is doing something with sales engagement, then part of the rules site could say, hey, let's hold off on Marketing to this person while that's actively... on.
Agent: Going there's a go the other direction too.
Speaker 7: Yes. And
Agent: Sure. Well, that's something that you could set up on the Sales Engagement side. I'm not an expert on sales engagement. So, as well, we might lean on you for that functionality specifically.
Agent: But I have heard of customers saying, hey, if somebody is actively in being marketed to on the Account Engagement side, let's not have them be in a Sales Engagement play.
Agent: But I do think the caveat there is that individual reps can add contacts and leads to a [ORG-46] program. And I'm not sure if there's a way to circumvent that happen.
Agent: If someone's act, but it might, from an automated process standpoint, that shouldn't be an issue [PERSON-10], any experience with that from your standpoint ?
Agent: Yeah, Sales Engagement doesn't exactly have the same concept of like a suppression list in there, right?
Agent: So it's a kind of a different animal, but definitely with attributes in [ORG-10], I mean, there's ways we can simulate these kinds of things on that side.
Speaker 7: But it almost feels to me that as a best practice, into every Marketing flow if that's how you want to proceed, right?
Agent: You would almost want to build that
Speaker 7: I mean... that hey if there's Sales Engagement
Agent: Going on let's pause Exactly.
Agent: On this.
Agent: You know
Speaker 7: And then that becomes part of you know the
Agent: Template for every flow.
Agent: Totally. So from that side of if someone's in a [ORG-46] program, don't send them [ORG-14] emails, that is fine. The flip side, I'm not as quite sure on if someone's in account engagement.
Agent: Can they be suppressed from receiving Sales Engagement messages?
Agent: I'm happy to look into it, but that's why these suppression lists come in here.
Agent: So here I have customers, but you could have a list that's just called [ORG-46] active, for example, that will suppress anybody at any point from being a part of these different sort of Marketing program.
Agent: Programs if they're in an active [ORG-46] program .
EndUser: And that would be in dynamic based on any cadences that they're in just to be very specific.
Agent: Yep, [PERCENT-1]. All good questions and again just
Agent: Beneficial to talk through all of this. And again, one of the nice things about being on the [ORG-10] platform too just makes things easier for everyone across the board.
Agent: In terms of the flow itself though, I've built a very simple one here. Of course, you can have different types of flows for different situations.
Agent: Here, we're just sending out that [DATE-25] newsletter, seeing how people engage with it after [DATE-19].
Agent: So we'll take anyone who engaged by clicking on this newsletter down this yes path here where we create a [ORG-10] task that can go to the person.
Agent: And assigned to that individual prospect in your [ORG-10] CRM You can provide due dates and reminders and see in this case too we're even having the team add these different prospect s to a specific sales cadence Your team will get notified here in [ORG-10] via emai l and even via [ORG-6] if you like And you can still do some automated Outreach You could continue to build out these flows to make the m as sophisticated as you like or keep them very simple and straightforward Lots of flexibility, lots of functionality her e, and very easy to us e. And you can test these, get reporting on thes e, have lots of insights across the boar d. So I'll [PERSON-33] Any questions on creating these nurture journey s, it sounds like that's definitely somethi ng top of mind for the tea m. So any follow-ups her e?
Agent: Or we
EndUser: Get to go. Uh, just so for if I want to. So if I want to nurture a lead and I want to add that that I target with programmatic advertising, something that we could do here.
Agent: Lead to a list I assume that's I just don't see. Yes, no, don't know that. So you could have this be add to. I just have an ad suppression.
Agent: Let me see if I have a. I thought I had an ad list, but we'll pretend that this is active ads. So you can have it add to that specific ad list.
Agent: You could have one for [ORG-25] ads, LinkedIn ads, pass that over to the ad studio side of things where ad studio will be able to. pick up that ad journey,
EndUser: Push that person over, etc. So then, okay, so let's say I did that. I, we went down that list, they took whatever action that resulted in them getting added to that list.
Agent: So they're on
EndUser: That list, I got that list into the programmatic advertising platform. Then that prospect clicked on the ad and visited the landing page, which I have [ORG-47] tracks. So into sales force.
Agent: The event goes back
EndUser: I didn't use that ad click to trigger, them to a sales
Agent: You know, adding sequence because hey, they're engaging, the ads are interested together. Yeah, for sure, so you can use either one that landing page visit or view if you want, but you can also use.
Agent: The custom redirect link side of things. So if you have that link in the ad. I think I might actually have one.
Agent: Yeah, so we have a banner ad if someone clicks on that, they will automatically be added here. Or again, if someone doesn't click, we can take them down a different journey.
Agent: Got it. Awesome. Now we have [TIME-4] left. Want to just touch on some of the reporting capabilities.
Agent: Again, in addition to the Account Engagement tool that we're looking at here and the [ORG-50] tool, you also have access to [PRODUCT-1] intelligence, which is a whole other flexibility from a reporting standpoint to really help normalize a lot of that ad data specifically since [ORG-25] and [ORG-19] and [ORG-5] all sort of have their own ways and definition.
Agent: Intelligence is really going to be able to help normalize all of that data . you have out of the box supporting available here with the Account Engagement tool as well .
Agent: First off, as mentioned, we use the same campaign object across Marketing and sales . this is actually a [ORG-10] campaign .
Agent: Have, again, Einstein Insights available at the campaign leve l so I can come in and see which assets are performing particularly well for this campaign .
Agent: Will also help me identify new segments that might be a good fit so I can make sure that they ar e and build a dynamic list around this audience if I [PERSON-50] t, as well as, hey, if I notice something's not [ORG-31] as well, maybe I'm asking just too many questio ns in this form, shorten that up, tighten it up to give me a little bit more flexibili ty and get people filling out this fo rm at a higher rate, more consistent to our normal form engagement.
Agent: In addition though to those [PERSON-11] insights, of course we're also tracking how people move through this process with things like responses, opportunities created, one, the ROI itself, and we can come in as well and see how people actually interact with the campaign overall on these engagement history dashboards.
Agent: This is great to really start building out some of that [ORG-36] approach as we can see our most engaged accounts. Spikes and engagement, you can play around with the time frame, be it.
Agent: Asset type and the activity type And I can see who's engaged most recently just from an individual level too But if I wanted to click on green fields, for example I can see only [ORG-34]'s here is interacting Maybe I work with the account team who owns that relationshi p and say, hey, who else should we be inviting to this event We need more people from green fields Let's make sure that we can really get engaged ther e and help you from the Marketing sid e with that sales conversation Now, since we're using that same [ORG-10] Campaign Objec t. It allowed us to build an entire BI too l, again, included in your edition toda y, called B2B Marketing Analytic s. Because we have that same campaign obje ct across Marketing and sale s, it allows us to really dive deep into that Marketing and sales alignme nt to understand, again, attribution, [ORG-37], and the overarching [PERSON-37] With this BI tool called B2B [ORG-37], you'll have access to five out of the box dashboard s. This is built on to p. of [PRODUCT-4] analytics.
Agent: So you can actually come in and create custom dashboards. Pretty much any data that lives within your [ORG-10] database is fair game.
Agent: But from a short out of the box functionality, which is what we'll look at [DATE-4], you have access to an [ORG-31] dashboa rd, engagement, Marketing manager, which is what we're looking at right now, multi-touch [PRODUCT-6] on, and pipeline.
Agent: Again, all available out of the box. Here, as you can see, I can get a quick gla nce at my [LOC-5] health, a quick glance at my engageme nt. and everything here is dyna mic.
Agent: So I can actually click on this trade show campaign, for exam ple. It will update to show me the pipeline, the revenue, the conversion to close time, specifically for that trade show campaign.
Agent: I can share these dashboards with members of my team, whether it be posting to chatter, giving someone access or just downloading these dashboards too.
Agent: What's also nice is that I can come in and explore any of these out-of-the-box views, add in different fields and filters, play around with the visuals of it.
Agent: It gives me a lot of flexibility without even having to build it to custom dashboard to see. detailed information that might be more relevant to what I'm looking for or what I need I'll pause here.
Agent: We'll take a look at any of the other dashboards as well I particularly really like this multi-touch attribution questions ?
EndUser: And [ORG-31] dashboard but any initial
Agent: Thoughts so far.
Agent: Can you export this to power BI?
Agent: That's a good question. I'm not sure if you can export it specifically to power BI. I'm happy to take a look. So I mean, I'm not sure if you or your team have done that in the past.
Speaker 7: You certainly can download the data, but I'm not sure specifically there's an Integration I guess the short question would to power BI.
Agent: Be, is there an API access to the data?
Agent: There is API access to the data. And we don't need to talk about it. It's fine. Okay.
Speaker 7: I was going to say that you from an API
Agent: Perspective, I'm set that up yourself, don't know if there's a answer.
EndUser: Sure you can but I
Agent: If the answers, yes, we're fine on that.
EndUser: Okay. Then yes, you should be fine then.
EndUser: [PERSON-33], did you have a question too?
EndUser: Yeah, I have a last question. Thank you very much for the demo. I know [PRODUCT-7] has a customer journey builder.
Agent: What's the difference between the app studio and the journey builder?
Agent: Yeah, good question. So [ORG-49] is another one of our [PRODUCT-1] tools. It's part of the Marketing Cloud engagement platform. That is a great focus.
Agent: If you're focused more on a one-to-one individual journey as opposed to an account-based journey, and it also has a lot of focus on more of a self-service approach for things like e-commerce triggers, paying attention to again somebody's individual behavior, whereas here in account engagement, we are looking at that individual behavior, but also looking at that broader view of one, how does this impact the sales team here internally directly, and two, from a customer perspective, how does this work at the account level?
Agent: So that's really where the biggest distinction lies is more on that. Self-service one-to-one [ORG-49] versus here in [ORG-14] where we have that
EndUser: Journey in
EndUser: More. sales alignment and account-based focused journey . understood. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Great question though. One thing I really want to make sure we understand this is comprehensive.
Agent: I mean, I do appreciate the demo on the tools super robust, right?
Agent: How do I train my team?
Agent: Yes, great question. So again, that's absolutely something [PERSON-10] and his team can help with for that initial implementation.
Agent: I wasn't part of the original deal process that, [PERSON-6], I don't think you were either, but it sounded like there was an [LOC-6] that might have been created to one help implement and to train the team.
Agent: The second thing though, as [PERSON-36] mentioned at the beginning, you do also have access to our premier success.
Agent: For account engagement, that is sort of an ongoing success team that works with you You can sign up for a variety of different sessions for one-on-one engagements for a variety of different things, whether it be building out those engagement studio programs taking a look at new features and functionality.
Agent: Doing a health check,
Agent: So there's a lot o f different ways that you can get support. [PERSON-36], I'm sure you can send over some information
Agent: O n Premier's success, but [PERSON-10], if you have any thoughts on that initia l Implementation and training side of things too.
Agent: I can pass it over to you to talk about [PERSON-11] Yeah, yeah, I think you covered it very well, right?
Agent: I mean, as we've done right now with the sales cloud, right?
Agent: We've got, we've done the initial implementation, but then helped with the team that's come on board with helping them see what we've implemented and how we've gone about doing it.
Agent: And of course, [PERSON-33] and a lot of other folks on the team there have picked up a lot of how to build and support on the sales car platform.
Agent: We would definitely be able to replicate a similar approach on the Marketing Cloud side and then we can also sort of, I mean we certainly don't get too deep into like Marketing strategy and things like that.
Agent: We know that that's really where you guys kind of will build your strategy.
Agent: But when it comes to just the tool itself, I mean, we are, will certainly have a reasonable amount of training activity as we go through and build the platform
EndUser: Out and go through our testing cycles before we get a deployed production. Yeah, I mean to clarify too, we have some junior members of the team.
EndUser: I don't know that I have much institutional knowledge in the group about how to use the tool.
EndUser: What about online resources?
EndUser: I think, you know, speaking, [GPE-14], they help us super strong in self-service, you know, kind of training as it relates to their tool. And that's one really attractive element do you guys stack there.
Agent: How up in terms of, you know, online training, self-guiding that kind of thing?
Agent: Totally, we have a whole resource [ORG-47] that's exactly that.
Agent: In addition to the resources that we already talked about, the premier success and [PERSON-10] and his team, [ORG-47] is a completely free resource that you and your team can use at any point.
Agent: I can even send you some trailheads over right away to kind of give you an insight, but it's not just for [ORG-14] either.
Agent: We have plenty of trailheads on all of our [ORG-10] tools, including [PRODUCT-8], as well as, you know, ads.
Agent: Studio, the intelligence tool I was speaking to earlier So very helpful, also learned how to use a lot of the tool s here at [ORG-10] as well .
EndUser: Very flexible And that's how I've
Agent: Yeah, if you have material you could share, I'd love to see it. Yeah,
Agent: Absolutely. And [PERSON-31], I can send that over to you to maybe send in a follow-up. Yeah, definitely.
Agent: I was going to say after this, I can include what I'll do in like a recap email, include this Recording so you guys could feel free to share that with your team.
Agent: I'll include a breakdown of your full contract. That way you guys know exactly what you have.
Agent: I'll include, I do also have some snippets on like premier success and some extra cooking sessions and then I'll include what [PERSON-50] is going to me.
Speaker 7: Send over, or excuse me, [PERSON-9] is going to send over to [PERSON-6], along those lines too, I think it would be helpful too to really understand not only what we have but what's available and what we don't have, right?
Agent: Hey,
Speaker 7: Because I think the whole, the challenge I see with [ORG-10] and Marketing sometimes with [PRODUCT-7] is that you guys have done so much rebranding. You have different components.
Speaker 7: It's really kind of getting a broad view of, you know, we ordered for dinner, right?
Agent: What have
Speaker 7: And what have we not ordered for dinner?
Speaker 7: And I think a little bit of clarity for this, for this, you know, group would be kind of nice to have on that on that.
Agent: So that we really have a good understanding Sure. Yeah, I'll see what
Speaker 7: I can find and send that over. Thanks.
EndUser: Yeah, of course. And [PERSON-33], I think you had a question I interrupted you. No, I'm sorry about that. No worries. I actually send a link in the chat.
EndUser: That actually has a good information about Marketing and then the [ORG-47] related to the marketing. So that link, if you could share with the team chat, I think they're going to benefit out of that.
EndUser: The Trailhead session there too.
Speaker 7: That's it for me. Awesome. Hey [PERSON-9], so the last question I have if we do
Agent: Have this, does that mean we have a sandbox for it too?
Agent: Yeah, so you do have a sandbox available for the [ORG-14] platform. I don't know off the top of my head if the additions of.
Agent: Add studio or intelligence includes the inboxes, but the [ORG-14] platform when I've been showing you [DATE-4] does include a sandbox.
Speaker 7: So once again, the challenge we're having internally is that we have kind of an internal deadline on when we're trying to make a decision on things.
Speaker 7: So we want to kind of be able to jump into all these tools as quickly as possible and start kind of kicking the tires on things.
Agent: Sure thing. Yeah.
Agent: When you ask the question about what's on the menu, are you looking specifically from a marketing, for the Marketing team?
Speaker 7: Or are you looking at it, [ORG-10] in general?
Speaker 7: Because. No, Marketing only. Because quite honestly, I think there's a little confusion, even for people who have been admins for [DATE-28], in terms of.
Agent: I think there's
Speaker 7: Okay, we see Marketing cloud, but it includes this piece and we get this thing and this thing and which things do we have
EndUser: Or do we have it all or do we have part of it?
EndUser: What don't we have?
EndUser: I think that's [PERSON-3], am I missing the boat on that one?
EndUser: Nope, Marketing Cloud is a... kind of an unwieldy beast in terms of all the pieces that can go into it.
EndUser: And it makes sense from a menu perspective of a B2C company would have purchased a completely different package that we would package, we would purchase. So no, you're having a full view of the menu would definitely help out.
EndUser: And if you guys can even give us an indication of, you know, products that might be good fits
Agent: For us versus products that you don't think we could even consider, that also would be pretty helpful too.
Agent: Yeah, there's definitely lots of resources available on all the different [PRODUCT-1] products. And I think that part of it will depend a lot on how your strategy involves.
Agent: From what you've said [DATE-4], if your focus is on that sort of more [ORG-31] approach, sales Marketing alignment, I think the mixture that you have right now is a really good fit.
Agent: But there's other tools like our personalization tool, which can really take things to the next level in terms of website personalization. So different accounts. view your web pages would see different things, for example .
Agent: There is a myriad of different options, but again , with what you have right now, we als o don't want to be overselling or putting too much in your plate . not beneficial for anyone .
Agent: Especially since this sounds like it sort of got los t in the shuffle regardless, I think, where you're at right no w with the Account Engagement tool, the intelligence tool , the [ORG-57] tool .
Agent: Based off of our conversation [DATE-4] is a good fit, but certainly happy to
Speaker 7: Work with [PERSON-31] and see if there's any resources we can pull just on the broader [PRODUCT-1] umbrella to.
Agent: I know we're three
Speaker 7: Minutes over. So maybe we should wrap it up. And then if we have any follow up questions, we can reach out directly. And if we need another
EndUser: We need another meeting on things as we kind of evaluate, then we will set that up immediately.
EndUser: Hey, one final question from my side, maybe it's for swarming is you mentioned Implementation and then kind of the support that goes along with that.
Agent: What is it like granted we have the tool, but how long does it take on average to implement and be up and running and functional in your experience?
Agent: Why don't we do this?
Agent: I can set up a separate call, walk you through what we had put together in the proposal previously and then we can see if that
EndUser: Needs to change or get adjusted. That way it will be a little bit more, give us a little bit more time to chat I am just kind of through that.
Agent: Okay, fair. But curious about a job in the pipeline.
Agent: Are you not comfortable sharing this?
Agent: It's so easy. for different companies or... No, no, I'm just late for another meeting. That's one part of it. But I mean, there are times when we've
EndUser: Done like implementations that are like [DATE-33] and there are things that we've done that are [DATE-33], right?
Agent: So it really varies upon kind of the amount of work we're doing in that implementation.
Agent: So you guys available in the near future to start our project or are we on a waitlist, essentially?
EndUser: That's right. Are
Agent: Can I get back to you on that Typically we say like two is kind of the duration can get.
EndUser: One?
EndUser: Two [DATE-28]
Speaker 7: That we can.
Agent: We Okay.
Speaker 7: Yeah.
Agent: Cool. We'll meet you all. Thanks again, but I do have to drop right now.
Speaker 7: I will send over this recording, everything that we talked about. Just give me some time.
Agent: It'll probably be about [DATE-33] morning.
EndUser: But if you have any questions
Agent: In the meantime, please don't go from there.
Speaker 7: Hesitate to reach out
EndUser: And we'll
EndUser: Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 8: So, [PERSON-37], thanks [PERSON-9] for walking through everything. Appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Bye all. Thank you guys.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. The customer expressed confusion about the products and features they currently have access to, as well as what they don't have. They requested a clear breakdown of their contract and what is included.

2. The customer has an internal deadline for making a decision and wants to ""kick the tires"" on the tools as quickly as possible. They need to understand what they can access and how to use it.

3. The customer is unsure about the implementation process and timeline. They asked for a separate call to discuss the proposal and implementation plan.

4. The customer is interested in understanding which products might be a good fit for them and which ones they shouldn't consider, indicating that they want help narrowing down their options.

5. The customer wants to ensure that the proposed solution aligns with their focus on an account-based approach and sales-marketing alignment. They need help understanding how the tools will support their specific strategy.

Answer to this question is unclear:
- The customer's budget was not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, so it is unclear if budget constraints could prevent the deal from closing.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Some of these questions include:
- ""Is there anything you want to layer in here that we make sure we're getting out of the conversation [DATE-4]?""
- ""I mean, is there anything specific you'd like to cover in this conversation [DATE-4]?""
- ""Can I ask that question again though?"" (referring to a question about external sources for Einstein scoring)
- ""How long do we need to have data collection happening through Marketing Cloud in order to get these insights?""
- ""Can we apply that decay model to event-based scoring, our manual score?""
- ""How does this work with our Sales Engagement cadence? Does it get connected with the cadence, or is it a totally separate system with the amount of [ORG-44] and sales engagement?""
- ""You would almost want to build that pause on this if someone's in a Sales Engagement program, right?""
- ""What's the difference between the app studio and the journey builder?""
- ""How do I train my team?""
- ""What about online resources?""
These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs, concerns, and priorities better, enabling them to tailor their presentation accordingly.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product, which includes Account Engagement, Intelligence, and Ad Studio tools, generally meets their needs for Marketing automation, lead scoring, and programmatic advertising. They expressed interest in robust campaign management tools, integration with outbound sales motion, enhanced lead scoring and management process, event tracking and logging, customer journey mapping, and robust reporting analytics. The seller demonstrated how the product can fulfill these needs, and the customer asked questions and provided feedback, indicating engagement and interest. However, the customer also had questions about the specifics of the implementation process, which suggests that they are still evaluating the product and have not made a final decision.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of the seller's product to help them with their Marketing automated platform needs, specifically mentioning the need for robust campaign management tools, integration with outbound sales motions, enhanced Lead Scoring and lead management process, event tracking and logging, customer journey mapping, and robust reporting analytics. They also mentioned the importance of the email Marketing program, social media management, landing page creation, and forms setup. The customer emphasized the need for these features to help them reach the right audience and improve their program, which they mentioned was a top priority for them.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and addressing their concerns. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's current situation and pain points. This would have helped the sales rep tailor their pitch to the customer's specific needs.
2. When discussing the features of the product, the sales rep could have asked the customer if they had any specific requirements or use cases in mind. This would have helped the sales rep highlight the features that are most relevant to the customer.
3. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep could have asked the customer if they had any remaining concerns or questions. This would have given the customer an opportunity to raise any issues that had not been addressed during the call.

Overall, while the sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs, there were a few missed opportunities to delve deeper into the customer's specific requirements and use cases.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or who the correct person would be if they were not. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The seller proposed setting up a separate call to discuss the proposal and implementation, but it is unclear if this call has taken place or what was discussed.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They expressed interest in the product and its features, and asked questions about implementation and support. However, they also had concerns about understanding the full scope of the product and its capabilities, and requested more information and a separate call to discuss the proposal in detail. Overall, they seemed engaged and interested in moving forward with the deal, but needed more clarity and understanding before making a decision.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of the company and product throughout the call. However, there are a few instances where they could have provided more clarity or elaborated further:

1. When discussing the difference between Account Engagement and [ORG-49], the rep mentioned that Account Engagement is better for account-based journeys and sales alignment, while [ORG-49] is more focused on one-to-one individual journeys and self-service. It would have been helpful if the rep provided a concrete example or two to illustrate the differences more clearly.

2. The rep briefly mentioned the Premier Success team, which offers ongoing support and training. However, they could have emphasized the value of this service more strongly, especially since the customer expressed concerns about having junior team members with limited institutional knowledge.

3. When discussing the implementation process, the rep could have provided more specifics about the timeline and what to expect during the implementation phase. While they did mention that the duration can vary, they could have given a rough estimate or shared success stories of similar implementations to give the customer a better idea of what to expect.

4. The rep could have done a better job of addressing the customer's concerns about the complexity of Marketing Cloud and the different components that come with it. While they did mention that the mixture of tools the customer currently has is a good fit, they could have provided more guidance on how to navigate the platform and make the most of the tools they have access to.

5. The rep could have provided more information about the sandbox environment for the [ORG-14] platform, including whether the add-ons like Account Engagement, Add Studio, and Intelligence include sandboxes as well. This would have helped the customer better understand the resources available to them during the implementation and testing phases.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""So, [PERSON-3], are you done in [GPE-1] [DATE-1] or up in [GPE-2]?"" The customer provided a detailed response about their current location and their recent move, indicating engagement in the conversation.
2. ""What we sell. Okay. Thank you for all joining [DATE-4]. So, I'm with you. Thank you for the. I'm not going to cut you any [ORG-6] on that one, though."" The sales rep acknowledged the customer's input, which seemed to encourage the customer's engagement in the conversation.
3. ""So, you're saying we don't need to go across the street to [ORG-10]."" The customer engaged in a discussion about their current situation with [ORG-10] and showed interest in understanding their options.

These questions seemed to pique the customer's interest and resulted in more engaged responses.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. The customer was unsure about the functionality and features of the product as they had previously purchased it but did not implement it. They wanted to clarify if they needed to look at other options or if they could utilize their existing contract.
2. The customer was also unclear about what products and services they already had access to, as the Marketing Cloud platform has many components. They requested a clear breakdown of their contract and what was included.
3. The customer had a tight internal deadline for making a decision on the product and wanted to quickly explore and evaluate the tools. They inquired about the availability of a sandbox for the Account Engagement platform.
4. The customer was interested in understanding the differences between the Journey Builder and App Studio, particularly in terms of one-to-one individual journeys versus account-based journeys with sales alignment.
5. The customer wanted to know more about the implementation process, training, and ongoing support for the product, as they had junior team members who needed guidance on using the tool. They were also interested in online resources and self-guided training options.

Overall, the customer's top concerns revolved around understanding the product's features, their existing contract, evaluating the tools, and finding appropriate training and support for their team."
video_19782_167_6qr3y000000sbCyAAI,"Agent: Oh, there you go. Awesome. So again, for those of you who have not met on our previous call, my name is [PERSON-1]. I am [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3]'s partner on the technical side.
Agent: And really, my goal as a solution engineer is to partner with your team to understand your challenges, your priorities, your vision for the future. And I think on the last call, we delved into that a little bit.
Agent: But then the take all that assess it and then align our sales forces capabilities can really help you.
Agent: Reach your goals and your desired business outcomes And just a quick [TIME-1] about me Prior to the solution engineer role I was also a marketer like yourself So I've been on the other side of the fence And I know [DATE-1] how incredibly challengin g It is with just a plethora of data, systems, technology, apps that you have to manage.
Agent: So hopefully what we show you [DATE-1] will give you a little glimpse into how we can help you. In terms of what we'll look at [DATE-1], this is a slide you're seeing on the screen right now.
Agent: We're going to look specifically at [PRODUCT-1], of course, share on [ORG-1] or [DATE-2].
Agent: And really the goal of Marketing Cloud engagement is to empower your team to connect [ORG-2] alluded to, that entire customer journey from that first touch to ongoing engagement, to purchase, to then turning those individuals into loyal subscribers, advocates, loyalists to your company.
Agent: The way that's done is primarily broken down in three ways . very first, again, [PERSON-3] alluded to [TIME-2] , just want to dive into a little bit i s by activating relevant customer data .
Agent: Told us about some of the dat a that's kind of disconnected [DATE-1] . the first thing that we're going to focus o n is how you activate and unify all that data .
Agent: Once you've done that , How do you then engage your audience with highly dynamic, highly personalized [PRODUCT-2] on their preferred channels?
Agent: And then once you've done that, of course, you need insights to understand your performance, where the improvements can be made and how you're doing.
Agent: What we've seen is when our customers are able to do those three things and by no means simplifying those three things I know there's a lot involved here, but when our customers are able to do that they actually see [PERCENT-1] Increase engagement so the opportunities are definitely significant here and we hope to help you realize those opportunities Any questions on what we're gonna look at [DATE-1]?
Agent: Nothing awesome. So I'm going to share my screen.
Agent: Can everyone just give me a head nod that you're seeing my screen?
Agent: Okay. Yes, thumbs up. Awesome. So what we're looking at now is [PRODUCT-3] engagement. And as a marketer, I have access to the capabilities, the permissions that I have been granted.
Agent: So in my case, I tend to show all parts of the platform. So you'll see lots of options, advanced options. So I have access to everything.
Agent: But just know that you can configure the platform based on your needs, based on the needs of your team members. What we're looking at here is [NORP-1] n the homepage.
Agent: So this is my starting point, your team's starting point, and how you access different areas of the platform.
Agent: Across the top, you'll see the different channels that you can engage with your customers on, whether that's email, mobile studio, a little bit of social advertising, and then the web as well.
Agent: So again, doesn't mean necessarily need to leverage all these channels, but know those capabilities are there. And that's one differentiation.
Agent: Between what you have [DATE-1] in PartDOT and Marketing Cloud engagement, where you have all of those cross-channe l capabilities . So you just wanted to highlight that as well.
Agent: Once you have your channels, this next section here are all what we call the builder.
Agent: So where you're actually creating the content, where you're creating audiences, where you're creating emails, and those campaigns or journeys that we'll look at in [TIME-3]. Finally, on the right here is [PERSON-4].
Agent: And we'll look at some of those capabilities [DATE-1]. [PERSON-5], you talked a lot about wanting advanced capabilities, leveraging the [PRODUCT-4] to make your team more efficient, to make it quicker to create content.
Agent: So we'll look at some of those [FAC-1] capabilities [DATE-1], just kind of throughout the demo. And finally, the app exchange, just think about that similar to [ORG-3] on your iPhone or [ORG-4].
Agent: These are plug and play apps.
Agent: That you can take advantage of to make your team more productive So whether that's a webinar, whether that's, let's say you're doing print we have apps that we can plug and play into Marketing Cloud engagemen t to make you more efficient and to provide those advanced capabilities .
Agent: And I'd really like to think of that for your team as a way to foolproof your marketing. So maybe [DATE-1] you're not thinking about print, but maybe in the future there's a need for that.
Agent: From what I hear and what we've seen contrary to profitable belief, print is not dead. There are still use Cases that are very valid, very impactful for print.
Agent: So just a couple of examples of how we might extend the platform beyond what we're talking about [DATE-1].
Agent: Finally, as I scroll down, in terms of keeping your team on the same page, you'll see a calendar that summarizes everything that's happening across marketing. Again, this is a demo instance.
Agent: You don't see a whole lot populated here because we don't tend to send emails through this demo instance is to to an audience. These are just demo assets.
Agent: But you can see this can bring your team on the same page in terms of everything that's going on. So you're all in sync on the day-to-day happenings across marketing.
Agent: Across the bottom here, you have access to resources that can help you get up to speed on the platform, training, asking questions, engaging with the community.
Agent: So you're always interacting with all the resources that you have access to across [ORG-5]. And then on the bottom here are the details of all of the activities that are available.
Agent: Are taking place again in terms of recent campaigns that [ORG-6] e orchestrated recent emails that we've built and recent emails tha t we've sent again we're not really sending from th e STEM environment that's why you see that blank .
Agent: One of pause for [TIME-3] here and just see if there are any questions on kind of this overview of Marketing Cloud engagement.
EndUser: Is this a personalized dashboard that we could adjust or is this a set dashboard.
Agent: So you can control specific apps, but the dashboard will be personalized based on permissions and roles that you assigned to specific users and that's all configurable in the platform.
EndUser: Got you.
Agent: Awesome, so that's kind of the intro, the navigation, the lay of the land, if you will, in terms of Marketing Cloud engagement.
Agent: Now, as I think about marketing, as I think about, and then [PERSON-6], what you shared with us, I know, and marketers know that data is the foundation for everything that Marketing does on a day-to-day basis.
Agent: So, [PERSON-5], you talked about the need to better leverage data to create more impactful campaigns. So, I want to address that first.
Agent: One of the benefits of Marketing Cloud engagement is that you define and organize information about a contact and everything else that you know need to know or want to know about them.
Agent: So, The system at its highest level is data agnostic. Doesn't matter where the data comes from, you can easily build and link data as you need to.
Agent: So the way you do that is through this data designer hub and spoke model with your contact in the center. That's your audience, your customers, your prospects who you're communicating to.
Agent: And then all of these attributes on the outside that are connected to that contact. So if I dig into this a little bit, if I dig into the customer.
Agent: Kind of spoke here You can see that I have information about the customer That information can be behavioral informatio n or it can be profile information So in the case of profile information who is this individual What company do they belong to Your customer company, what state are they in I can also start to profile them at a deeper level So if I know, again, in your case if they belong to the chemical industr y or they've told us that or we've glean that informatio n. That profile information can be stored her e. They belong to pulp and pape r. Again, one of your target industrie s, I can store that information here as [PERSON-7] I'll show you an example of how I've done that f or demo purposes in this industry [PERSON-8] These are known attributes that I know [PERSON-9] this customer from a profile [ORG-7] This is going to be very important as we talk about personalization and segmentation and serving up dynamic [PRODUCT-5] for each specific customer that's relevant and contextual to them.
Agent: So that's the profile information. The second piece of this is the behavioral attributes.
Agent: For example, this table of products you see here could include information like, what [ORG-8] products or services have they purchased in the past?
Agent: Do they own your air emission software or do they own one of your hardware analyzers?
Agent: When did they buy it?
Agent: Has it been serviced?
Agent: Have we ever had some type of Support case issued against them?
Agent: All that behavioral data could be... stored here as well.
Agent: Again, this is just an example of how this could be organized for demo purposes, but you could continue to build on to this and add additional tables here, which are just going to house that data that you need to better target, personalize, and segment your audience.
Agent: So I just want to make
EndUser: One is lost here. sure I understand this correctly. So what we're saying is, let's say we have one person, one contact.
EndUser: And the advantage to this is that not only do we pull data from [ORG-5] and [ORG-5] fields about this one contact, we're also going to pull in all the data related to this one contact about what pages they visited on the website, whether or not they started to fill out a request or quote, but stocked it.
EndUser: And all that data from all these sources.
Agent: Various different
EndUser: Not just [ORG-5] is going to be pulled into the profile .
Agent: That's exactly right. That's exactly the advantage and the benefit of being able to structure this data in the way that you just described.
Agent: And the way we see a lot of this being used is, I think some of the attributes that you described just now are things that we would collect on [PRODUCT-3] as well.
Agent: I know you use [ORG-9] forms, but should you use [PRODUCT-3] forms or [ORG-10] parameters like that information could follow in from Marketing cloud. But beyond that, think like other sources outside of that as well.
Agent: So like social media ads platforms, again, like any of your events where even trade show information, even things that might not have like an open.
Agent: Information,
Agent: Api. If we want to, you know, during the Implementation process, a integrator could work and hel p you kind of set up like a quick like SFTV file drop from any of those different sources as well .
Agent: Yeah, and to that point, and I think that the advantage here for your team is, again, you talked about all these disparate data sources [DATE-1].
Agent: These data tables, these are just essentially data tables, rows and columns that can be populated again via a manual import of data.
Agent: So if you did have pay, I have offline data [TIME-4] to bring into better segment or market or personalized content.
Agent: You can bring that in in as simple of a way as importing data directly within the platform, or you can automate it again as three two many.
Agent: Either through an FTP, a file transfer, or in the case of [ORG-5] data that would be an API that would synchronize data so there's no extra work on your par t once we configure that connector.
Agent: So all of that data can be made available.
Agent: It's just how do you want to bring that data in?
Agent: And we would help you initially set that up and [ORG-11] has access . to all those data points.
EndUser: Gotcha.
Agent: So digging into this just a little bit deeper.
Agent: If I dig into the customer, again, just a table of customers with all the attributes that I need to better segment, better market, better personalized, I have an industry attribute you can see here.
Agent: If I had just a general checkbox, it's that they've purchased from us before or are they a customer or are they a prospect that just attended one of your events.
Agent: I noticed you guys do some webinars and events and trade shows and things like that. So we can add any. of those flags here and then start to intelligently market to those individual s based on that engagement .
Agent: You define these attributes. If I wanted to create a new one, I don't have to go to an IT team. I don't have to go to a database developer or someone else that's far, far away.
Agent: Your team is empowered to be able to create. those attributes and then start populating that data through the mechanisms that we just talked about, the option that we talked [TIME-5].
Agent: Again, no surprises in terms of you have access and visibility to the data. So this is just sample data that's been populated.
Agent: You can see for a couple of these customers or contacts, I've populated their industry as either chemical processing or glass manufacturing. Again, this could have been pulp and paper or any of the other Industries that you cater to.
Agent: But I'm going to show you how we then leverage the power of this data to [ORG-11] and to segment these individuals Again, simple example, but it should illustrate the point of how we use this data .
Agent: Any questions here, what questions can I answer from the broader team on like the first step here on getting the data that you need for better marketing?
Agent: Anyone else on the team and thank you [PERSON-5] for the questions.
Agent: What questions can we answer for you on getting your data into the system?
Agent: I'm just wondering, kind of just like in the interest of time, if we want to go to the [NORP-2] builder, the campaign builder, because I believe that like a lot of this data set up, like But you know, once it's set up, it's like, you know, kind of set it and forget it.
Agent: Show kind of like
Agent: It's cool.
Agent: So I feel like they might, that might be more relevant somewhat Yeah, sure.
Agent: To day to day. So I want to just take a quick stop by Content and email it in because I know [PERSON-5], that was important to you.
Agent: So would you like for me [PERSON-5] to cover the drag and drop email letter or would you like to go directly to orchestrate and campaigns and journeys.
EndUser: I think we need to look at the drag and drop email editor. I think that would make a So awesome.
Agent: Ok, great. once you've created the content, it's time to. organize all that content. And what you're seeing here is directly built within [ORG-13] engagement is a robust [PRODUCT-5] management tool.
Agent: And this is where your team can consolidate, organize, upload, documents, content, all from this single location. The tool is called [PRODUCT-5] builder.
Agent: And this is where I'll also create that dynamic messaging, emails, Content blocks, and virtually any type of Content that you need in order to effectively market.
Agent: So you can see here that I've created a folder or for [DATE-1]'s demo purposes, where I've organized all the [PRODUCT-5] whether it's an email, whether it's images or templates as well So you have complete flexibility to create any of that Content here .
EndUser: Is this a quick question?
EndUser: Is there an ability to have like a style guide, branding guide, you know, like there would be in [ORG-9] or Canva where, you know, you're like, H1 tags or all this, H2 is that, you know what I'm saying?
EndUser: Like a place to Yeah, yeah,
Agent: Find all that?
Agent: Um, typically the way I've seen customers do it again, different customers have done different ways, but typically some of those standards are stored in a template itself.
Agent: And I'll show you like all the different ways that those templates can be utilized.
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: So we're going to go ahead and just really quick go through emails and I'm going to get to journey. So here I can create an email message which is going to be a specific message.
Agent: I can leverage email templates. Again, we're going to focus on drag and drop [DATE-1].
Agent: But if you have someone in house who is familiar with HTML coding or you have an agency or a developer, someone who likes to Code HTML, absolutely you can bring that in here as well.
Agent: So we're going to go ahead and create an email message.
Agent: Sorry, was there a question ?
Agent: [PERSON-5] codes awesome [PERSON-5].
EndUser: I don't want to do it.
Agent: No, I don't want you to do it either. So we're we're gonna show we're gonna show you an easy way.
EndUser: Gonna show Thank you. [PERSON-5]'s done.
Agent: Here within the platform, have multiple ways of starting an email. So you're not starting from scratch. You can leverage a template and you talked about I need templates. I need like some of the best practices.
Agent: I need to get up to speed running very quickly.
Agent: So you can start with a basic template, which is just kind of a straw man, if you will, for a two-com layout, three-com layout, image heavy, not image heavy, and leverage any of these templates. Again, you can start.
Agent: Start with these basic empty layouts Or we also provide themed templates in here as well as well as [PERSON-5], what you just asked about is how do I ensure your brand best practices are included in here I created, for [DATE-1]'s example, a templat e that would be available in here Again, you can have multiple templates in here These are just a couple of samples that we have in the system So lots of ways to be able to create an email What we're going to do [DATE-1] is, in the interest of time we're going to add .
Agent: Email that I have already gotten started for us so we can understand, and you can understa nd how to create that target and personalized Messaging based on the data that we just looked a t. So again, tool is drag and drop, really easy, really flexibl e. It's easy enough for me to add [PRODUCT-5] by dragging the components on [FAC-2] to the canvas on the righ t. So very quickly here, I wanna go ahe ad and make this look a little bit more visually [PERSON-10] So I'm gonna again leverage the [PRODUCT-5] librar y, and I'm gonna go ahead and.
Agent: .. this ima ge. You can already see I had the logo in he re. I've got the hero image here as we ll.
Agent: So very easily, very quick ly, and I actually didn't wanna start with this templa te, so I'm gonna go ba ck. I actually wanted to start off with my email itself.
Agent: So I kind of got this started for us just so we wouldn't have to build it from scratch. But I'm very quickly showing you how easy it is for me to go back here.
Agent: And insert the image, that hero image that I just inserted [TIME-6]. So I've already started to insert the images I have through drag and drop.
Agent: Again, I'm not a coder, I can code, but to [PERSON-5] to your point, I can adjust the padding, the width, all of the properties of this image, the size of the image as well, very quickly drag and drop point and click.
Agent: I can also adjust this block. So if I wanted to do sophisticated layouts, I could do that here as well. At this point, I'm pretty happy with that image. I'm going to go ahead and... close that image out.
Agent: Where this gets really efficient for your team is, again, we talked a lot about AI in our last call, is where we start to leverage [PRODUCT-4] to actually create more inspirational content.
Agent: So in this case, I have a place or holder in here, it was a template, but I'm going to leverage [PRODUCT-4] to actually generate the Content for me. In case I didn't mention, this is just a welcome email.
Agent: Maybe it's first time someone's a customer or a prospect. I want to quickly write an email.
Agent: Again, to your point, [PERSON-5], you can specify that brand tone in the system and in your brand identity and kind of what your brand voice is.
Agent: So what I'm now going to do is I'm just going to say, yes, I got it. This is [PRODUCT-4] doing some magic for me. I'm going to say, OK. And now [PRODUCT-4] is going to.
Agent: Quickly spit out a couple of options here for me to take advantage of. And again, you decide what works for you. This is a really great starting point.
Agent: I don't have to have that proverbial writer's block and start from scratch. I'm going to go ahead and select this option. Meanwhile, I can also leave feedback for the AI. So that just helps improve the eye over time.
Agent: I'm going to go ahead and add that copy. So I was drafting an email about continuous emissions monitoring systems, which seems to be a strength of [ORG-8]. So I drafted a very quick piece of Content here .
Agent: What I'm also doing is promoting a webinar within this [PRODUCT-5] as well. So you can see very quickly I was able to create that email.
Agent: Now, if I wanted to get fancier with this, I could also start to leverage that data that we looked at [TIME-6]. to [ORG-14] this email.
Agent: So if I wanted the individual's first name, I can go ahead and add that first name. And I can just say I'm done editing here as well.
Agent: I've also personalized the subject line because from what we've seen, personalizing [PRODUCT-5] results in an Uplift in engagement in email. So I've gone ahead and done that as well.
Agent: If I wanted to continue building out this email, I have all of the options that I need to either do an AV test or add additional [PRODUCT-5] or a button.
Agent: Or again, if you do choose to HTML code, I can add HTML Code and Code directly within this drag and drop interface here as well.
Agent: So I want to pause for a second, because I've talked about a lot of things here.
Agent: I know this is an important topic for questions that you might have on how this might make your life a whole lot easier and end team.
EndUser: It seems, I mean, to me, is this so much better from what we're doing now?
EndUser: I mean, just I can see at least 10 steps we're cutting down on. For example, with a preheader now, you actually have to put that into the HTML. It's also a really easy step two forget.
Agent: I just started the
EndUser: Drag and drop. This is more similar to what we have in [ORG-9]. So I feel like this would be very similar looking and very easy for us to adjust to. I don't know.
EndUser: What do you all think?
Speaker 6: I mean, this is like, yeah. I'm also way more of a hands-on learner. And I don't always have [QUANTITY-1] of questions in the demo, but afterward is usually where my questions come in.
Speaker 6: But I mean, this is leaps and bounds from what we've been working with [DATE-3].
Speaker 7: I also
Speaker 8: Kind of found it too, like, kind of similar to the elementary tool we use on [ORG-9]. So I feel like we all kind of will already be able to navigate that.
Agent: Yeah, for sure. So this was I'm glad I'm going to appreciate the feedback. I'm glad this is received positively. So this was building the basic email now. I could go and add additional content. I could add additional layout.
Agent: So again, similar to the tools you're using [DATE-1], we want to make you efficient. We want to make it easier for you to quickly build these layouts.
Agent: If I decided that, you know what, this is not quite what I wanted. I really wanted three columns. I can go ahead and add those three columns.
Agent: If I change my mind, I can I can very easily delete kind of that.
Agent: Back column layout here as well So that was the overview of how easy it is to drag and drop Where this gets really powerful for your team is again, being able to preview it So if I wanted to preview this on desktop or mobile I can see that it's well formed .
Agent: And I can take this even to the next step and start to make this more dynamic other than just the first name personalization. You'll see I have a block here called dynamic content. So when we preview this email.
Agent: You We can start to see that I've inserted Content in here based on the knowledge of who this individual is.
Agent: Again, going back to that example of are they associated with the chemical industry or the pulp and paper industry?
Agent: And I define that dynamic Content directly again within this UI by a simple rule. If their industry is chemical processing, then I'm going to insert [PRODUCT-5] that your team would create and [ORG-14] this email.
Agent: If it's class manufacturing, then we're going to change the content.
Agent: In real-time altogether So what I'm now starting to do is make that [ORG-13] between the data we have, the data that we know the power, what it is that we d o in terms of personalizing this [PRODUCT-5] So what you're seeing here is just one of those customer s from that data table we looked at earlie r and you can see this individual is associate d with glass Manufacturing So now this [PRODUCT-5] is highly Personalize d to this individual Now they're gonna take note that , That's really interesting.
Agent: Ok, that's my industry. They're speaking to me. So we're now starting to create that one-to-one personalization based on the data that we have. Again, this is a very simple example. But let's think about your service data.
Agent: Let's think about your webinar attendance. Let's think about forms that they may have filled out and information they have given that you now have access to within the platform. Let's think about information from [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: Did they have a case recently that we were able to resolve to satisfaction?
Agent: If we weren't, maybe we insert content. engineer that says, you know, we really appreciate your business and we would appreciate you r your feedback, whatever it might be, leveraging that data to power this dynamic [PRODUCT-5] .
EndUser: Yeah, I love that. That's so exciting. There's so much we can do with that.
EndUser: I mean, just, I think there's a lot of possibilities for [ORG-11], but also just serving our own customers and making the information more relevant to them instead of just blasting out the same message It would behoove us more if we had individualized messages.
Agent: To everyone.
Agent: Absolutely, absolutely.
Agent: And last thing here, just for your team, in terms of just collaboration across the team, you can send to, we want to make sure that this is, email is accurate, it's well formatted, adheres to your brand guidelines as professional.
Agent: So we can send to a seed list from here, we can even take the testing and proving to the next level with the built-in integration, if you have a litmus account, you can now start to preview what this email will look like across, I believe it's over 79 different email clients directly.
Agent: Here within Marketing Cloud engagement So I can see that in [ORG-14], for example this email looks pretty good So I'm good to go I can see that dynamic content, again for that sample individual that we looked a t is being embedded into this just as I wanted it to be So very quick, very easy to be able to preview that [PRODUCT-5] directly here within the email builder .
Agent: And at this point, I can save this email or I'm ready to go ahead and send this email. But more than likely, I don't want to do one-off emails. You want to be more efficient.
Agent: We want to help you be more efficient.
Agent: And that's where we get into how do we orchestrate multiple sets of emails?
Agent: If this was the first email in a welcome campaign, how do we then start to understand how it is that this individual is engaging?
Agent: And in this case, it's all yet.
Agent: And if they're not engaging, how do we start to engage them and take that?
Agent: Take them down that path to conversion.
Agent: So, want to pause and I'm going to jump into journey orchestration and campaign orchestration next, but do want to give you an opportunity to ask any questions you might have on the email piece.
Agent: And if you don't have any, we'll happily move on.
EndUser: And one bit
Agent: As a new urge gets into that screen for [WORK_OF_ART-1] is that he probably already mentioned this and I might have missed it, but the dynamic [PRODUCT-5] doesn't need to be plain text.
Agent: I mean, it can be images as well. So you can have relevant product services, ports, all that show up.
Agent: You can even have like a sales rep's name pull over from sales force to say, like, hey, like, you know, looking forward connecting soon. Best whatever it is as well.
Agent: Yep, great point. And a great example of that is I inserted a somewhat static hero image here.
Agent: But again, if we had those data points from [ORG-5], if we had an individual attended a webinar on a certain topic, versus someone who attended on another topic, we could Personalize every piece of Content in here.
Agent: And it's more relevant and increases the likelihood of this individual engaging so lots of opportunities to be able to do that to really amp up your email programs.
EndUser: Absolutely. So I'm going to assume that [ORG-13] is similar to engagement studio.
EndUser: Are the renamed [ORG-11]?
Agent: Yeah, it's a little bit different. I think you'll find you'll find there are similarities, but there are differences as well. So let's go ahead and look at look at [ORG-13]'s if that's okay.
Agent: So revisiting where we are in our Marketing journey [DATE-1] for [DATE-1]'s demo, you've unified your data, you've created Messaging that's highly personalized, you've tested that messaging.
Agent: So now you're really ready to orchestrate a campaign, which is going to be a series of intelligent communications that are all coordinated.
Agent: So, What we're looking at here is called [WORK_OF_ART-1], again, similar to what you're doing [DATE-1] on the automation studio side. But from this single screen, we can start to build out those journeys.
Agent: And those journeys can be of multiple types. You have lots of flexibility. And we'll look at each of these. We'll look at primarily multi-step journeys, which is exactly what it says. A series of Marketing touch points intelligently coordinated.
Agent: If this was a single send, let's just say the email that I just sent now is my name. one email welcome campaign. I could absolutely do a batch and last with a single send .
Agent: I can also do transactional sand. So, customer buys a product or they just had a service call and I have that information coming over from sales for sales or service. I can trigger communications transactionally as well.
Agent: So, every time they have a case, if the rating was less than three, then maybe I want to send a feedback. So, I rate a gauge what went wrong.
Agent: Those are transactional messages which you can do here as well. So we're going to do a multi-step journey, but again, we want to help you jumpstart your program.
Agent: So what we're going to provide you is a series of journey templates built into the platform. You can create your own best practice templates here as well.
Agent: So we're going to leverage one of these templates as a starting point for our journey. Going back to our email, we're going to actually create a welcome journey here. That's what you're looking at now.
Agent: So the first step of any journey, again, this is [WORK_OF_ART-1], the first step of any journey is to think through where's this data coming from?
Agent: How do I want to engage with this audience, this target audience?
Agent: And then what decisions along the way are going to help me tailor this orchestration and customize the path that my customers go down based on how they engage actions they take or inaction if they don't engage.
Agent: So I'm going to walk you through... through each of those pieces here as well But again, all drag and drop I'm gonna go ahead and select my audienc e for this specific campaign Going back to our example earlier that's the list of customers that table of customers we looked at earlier However, if this was data from [PRODUCT-6] if this was service data if this was recent webinar attendees if this was those who attended an event in person you have access to all of that data , through these data tables directly from here.
Agent: So again, you're not going to another team to have them pull the data. You have direct access to that data here.
Agent: From a segmentation standpoint, you have access to all of those, the comprehensive attributes that we looked at earlier. So what company this is individual belongs to, what type of customer are they, what industry they belong to.
Agent: So in this case, if I want to further segment down this welcome campaign and only look at those who are.
Agent: Associated with the glass Manufacturing industry then I can do that directly from here as well So now I've kind of taken that first step . and define my audience for this campaign right here.
Agent: So you can now see that I see, turn this guy off, individuals are a part of this campaign. And I further segmented based on a filter criteria where I'm only looking at individuals who are in glass manufacturing.
Agent: So that's how I start to build my campaign here. Now, we talked a lot about AI again and how that can improve your efficiency. So I'm going to start becoming a little bit more intelligent here.
Agent: And I'm going to go ahead and drag this [PERSON-4] app here. What this is going to do now is look at the history of my subscribers. So imagine I'm one of your customers.
Agent: I wake up, I reach for my cell phone, and I open my inbox to check emails that I received from [ORG-8] after [TIME-7] of rest.
Agent: Or I'm on my lunch break and maybe I'm commuting home and that's when I check my email. That's the optimal time when I check my email.
Agent: Whatever that timeframe is, the Einstein AI understands when I'm most likely to engage the propensity for me to engage with those emails and sends those emails at the right time for each of your customers.
Agent: So typically what we've seen customers do is insert that [PERSON-4] step, it's called a flow control, before they send an email. So now...
Agent: When I send this welcome email, which I'm going to go ahead and quickly select from here Again, I don't need to go anywhere else I'm doing all this from kind of that one centralized dashboard or screen I'm going to go ahead and select that welcome email that we looked at earlier here That's my email I can configure that email I can decide who is coming from and have some advanced options here as well Already, I've started to build a very targeted campaign .
Agent: I've started to add some intelligence in it as well. And I can start to take some decisioning with these controls that are available here.
Agent: So before I send, let's say, the second email in this welcome series, I can start to understand and decision based on, you know what, did [NORP-3] actually open that first welcome email?
Agent: And do I care if he opened it or do I care if he clicked a link?
Agent: Do I care if that email bounced?
Agent: More than likely you care about all these things. But in this case, it's a welcoming.
Agent: I want to see if [ORG-13] click through to maybe our [PRODUCT-7] landing page that we link through the email If he did, now I want to start to action based on what he's don e or what he hasn't done And then I can continue to build .
Agent: This journey as I need based on my requirement.
Agent: Where this gets really, really interesting is through all the capabilities you have, because you're going to integrate this with [ORG-13], and when you integrate this with [ORG-26] Cloud.
Agent: So if I see a certain action taking place, if NIRG opens this email, I can actually create tasks, I can create leads on the [PRODUCT-6] side, I can update the Sales rep that said, hey, NIRG is really interested in our a hardware analyzer product, maybe you should reach out to him.
Agent: So we can start to make that connection between our Marketing activities and really drive sales impact at the same time through the options that are available here.
Agent: If I now know that maybe [PERSON-11] wasn't interested in hardware analyzer, she's really interested in maybe your software.
Agent: In real time, I can drag a step and update [PERSON-11]'s contact directly within [PRODUCT-6], directly within here that integrates with your [PRODUCT-6] to say, you know what?
Agent: [GPE-1] is really interested in software and not hardware, and that's kind of what we're seeing So we're going to update that insight and that data point and make it available on the [PRODUCT-6] side .
Agent: I'm going to pause for [TIME-3] because I did a lot of talking there on questions on this journey orchestration and how you would build this out. And again, I just did this for an email channel.
Agent: I can certainly drag SMS advertising, those cross channel capabilities here as well.
EndUser: You know, [PERSON-6], it didn't really occur to me until just now, strangely not that. And I don't know if we have service cloud.
EndUser: Do you know if we have service cloud?
Agent: We don't know.
EndUser: That not only can this be leveraged for leads and for sales, but it can also be leveraged potentially for customer support.
EndUser: And I think what I was thinking is, you know, I don't know if customer Support or the [ORG-30] tech team sends out surveys every time they do a customer visit or, you know, I think there's a lot of survey and feedback data that could drive these kinds of journeys that could be coordinated with customer Support potentially.
EndUser: However, it does sound like they would need to be on Service Cloud for us to do that.
Agent: So with surveys, there are some simple surveys that can be built into an email within Marketing need?
EndUser: Cloud. Right. What do we necessarily
Agent: Certain cloud.
Agent: Again, as long as the system has access to that data, wherever that data is coming from, even if it's something as simple as every night, I need an upload or file of all the individuals who logged a service case whose rating was less than three.
Agent: We can use that data to kick off our journey here and that data would just feed into this first step here where we had that data extension again.
EndUser: So they wouldn't need service club to do that. That's just data we get pulled from our, like if they submitted X number of Cases or prevent the X number. [DATE-4], things like that.
EndUser: I know they already do a survey, but I was kind of thinking as a.. You know, if they had, it's just a silly example, if they called customer Support for four different Cases around reporting, maybe they're a good candidate for reporting services, they obviously are struggling with that.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Because
EndUser: So I think there's a lot of potential there to leverage that data from the service side in order for us to do Marketing campaigns.
Agent: Yeah, it's a great use case.
Agent: Same. One thing.
Agent: Yeah, I just wanted to clarify that you guys do have service cloud. You have sales and service cloud. That's what I'm not sure if you guys just aren't using it for the full service offerings that you have.
Agent: I saw in the contract.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: But you do have sales and service cloud. So whether that's I don't know, extending more licenses to those people or however you're using that, that's not fully being Realize, but
EndUser: It's not it's probably not being used for many any service aspect of it It we have service people they're not using the service aspect of The platform we may have just extended a license to them as a service because maybe it It is a lower cost than a sales license I'm not sure.
EndUser: Okay, I've just it sounds like what we can either wherever they have we can get their data and we might be able to use it for some cool stuff.
Agent: So, yeah, maybe [PERSON-2] can connect with you [PERSON-6] separately and make sure that your team is leveraging that effectively so that you know we can use that data.
Agent: On the service piece
Agent: But two other things that I wanted to point out here, [PERSON-5], you kind of hit it on the head in terms of leveraging that information that comes from the service side to say, hey, there have been four Support cases.
Agent: You know, maybe there are there are good candidates for reporting, you know, and identifying that. Just just similar to that kind of use case.
Agent: There are a couple ways where you can further align with your sales and Support team is that one, you know, we talked about how we can.
Agent: Add in steps in the journey, update contacts or you know, track lead or service a lead to people. with those icons that [PERSON-11] showed.
Agent: The other thing that you can do is filter the data of the customers that you're reaching out to based on specific parameters as well.
Agent: So saying like, hey, if there's a current active opportunity on the account, we don't want to send out Marketing emails.
Agent: Or if there is like a really bad survey that came back or Support Cases that are currently flat, we don't want to send them Marketing emails and we want to suppress that.
Agent: So you can use that information to even tick off a journey too.
Agent: And the second thing I want to mentioned is that while we call this Marketing Cloud I really like to consider customer engagement Because again, like [PERSON-5], you mentioned you can be sending out emails like as if you are like a service rep or as if you are a Sales rep And we showed some of those dynamic like HTML looking kind of fancy Marketing email templates You can of course send out plain text emails as well So you can have a journey that looks like it's jus t an outlook email that's plain text and insert the signatur e of whoever is is listed as a sales contact or service contact in [ORG-30] and essentially nurture someone to help Support sal es efforts or service efforts because we always know [PERSON-13] people say they're going to follow up with leads, but may be after a trade show, they're not the best at following up wi th those leads.
Agent: And perhaps we want to just send out that Messaging for the m.
EndUser: Yeah, that's kind of a bit clunky right now. I mean, you can set up a template, but they still have to go into [ORG-5], select the template and send them from [ORG-5].
EndUser: So work a lot more smoothly, I think with this tool.
Agent: Yeah, that would
Agent: Yes, you can have that fully automated for them.
Agent: So last thing here in the interest of time, I'm going to just mention one more thing here because I think it's a key differentiator. Again, I talked about again, [ORG-1] [DATE-1]. What you're using [DATE-1] is primarily email.
Agent: Here's where you get into multi-channel cross-channel. So in this case, if I know that someone's not engaging with email, or they're engaging. Maybe I try a different panel, whether it's WhatsApp or push notification.
Agent: I can start to now engage on different channels for improved results. So I'm not limited here just to emails. I can truly take that cross-channel approach.
Agent: When I'm done, I can save this journey, but I can also validate it. So the system does the requisite checks and balances.
Agent: So if there is something that I have not done or haven't properly configured, it's intelligent enough to do that hard work for you. So you don't have to do all that troubleshooting. And then you have analytics built in.
Agent: The one thing that I think is going to be a huge efficiency play for you here is, [PERSON-5], you talked about [ORG-21].
Agent: You want to do it?
Agent: [ORG-30], all of these emails that you were seeing here will append those [ORG-10] parameters. So then you can start to understand beyond the click beyond the open.
Agent: What am I actually doing?
Agent: Okay, I ended up on that landing page like what did I do?
Agent: Did I convert?
Agent: Did I complete a form?
Agent: So with the [ORG-21] integration, You'll have [ORG-33] built right within this one screen where you'll be able to see for each message, like what did individuals click on?
Agent: Did they open?
Agent: So you have that deeper level of insight on what is happening beyond just the click.
Agent: You're correct me if I'm wrong, but you can also. Select messages that go out saying, Hey, you only feel that partially for him like we miss you.
Agent: And so it's worth to.
Agent: Try to get them further.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: Again, based on data that is known or based on data that's unknown, these journeys can be highly tailored based on that data, which is really why we have the data conversation first, because everything from there on out really hinges on that data that's available to you.
Agent: And I think you do have a lot of data, just how can we help you bring that data, put it in the hands of Marketing so you can more intelligently engage here in a more efficient way.
EndUser: Yeah, form abandonment is a great example of a way we could leverage this.
Agent: Yeah, a great example and I'm happy to share more information about [ORG-21] with you We've published [QUANTITY-1] of Content out there About Google Analytics. So we have [TIME-8] left.
Agent: So I do Think it's important and I'm hoping the team is okay with me just talking a little bit about Analytics if that's okay
EndUser: Works for me
EndUser: I have to drop off exactly at hand. If all available, you can stay on and continue to collaborate.
Agent: You guys are
EndUser: For me, the next steps for me is working towards, will it take to implement this?
EndUser: Will our cost difference be?
EndUser: And how soon [DATE-5] can we get this done?
EndUser: Thank
EndUser: You.
Agent: Well, I'd love to hear So I'll coordinate with [PERSON-5].
EndUser: That.
Agent: She has access to your calendar.
Agent: Maybe we can schedule some time at the end of this call with her to discuss next steps, had a partner scope this out for you in terms of Implementation costs and talk about pricing as well. OK. And
EndUser: I think timing as
EndUser: Well is a big one. And understanding what resources are needed on either side. Thanks, [PERSON-5].
EndUser: All right,
Agent: Thank you. [PERSON-5], does the team have time
Agent: To go over?
Agent: I just want to be mindful, everyone's timed.
Agent: Do you have [TIME-9] to go over, or should we schedule more time to dig into reporting?
Agent: What works for you?
Agent: I Thank you.
EndUser: Have time. Just today. So everybody else. OK, great.
Agent: Wonderful.
Agent: Should I like, I think, [TIME-10], right?
Agent: Yeah, [TIME-11]. Yeah. Very nice right before you
Agent: Hop in this one thing I did want to point out was again like the multi-channel functionality of Marketing Cloud engagement in terms of the journey builder.
Agent: So when you're talking about SMS, we do have SMS functionality that's built into [PRODUCT-3] engagement, which is different from part-off. It also has that ads functionality too.
Agent: So you can start to retarget ads within a journey or within a campaign or within that flow.
Agent: The third thing that I want to point out is we have an Integration with a third act party called [ORG-33] that does direct mail as well .
Agent: So while manufacturers, I think some of the more savvy ones that I'm speaking to now are like, we want to do text. Like that's something that's big for us on a roadmap. But maybe you're not quite there yet.
Agent: A lot of manufacturers, they know still do catalogs, still do direct mail, still do kind of poor mail.
Agent: If you have that, then it's actually a very interesting cost-saving kind of partnership where you can have direct mail only sent to people who are engaging with that or using those discount codes or buying from catalogs or we know how that and you can build it into a journey as [PERSON-14] l so that you're kind of starting off maybe with email [PERSON-13] e and then dropping off a direct mail to them .
Agent: I'll head back to the nearest.
Agent: Yeah, no, a great point. And again, that [ORG-33] app would just be another activity on that journey builder. So that's an app exchange app that you can access directly from there. So it's not like you're doing the integration.
Agent: It's just more of setup and configuration. So. Revisiting your Marketing team's journey at this point, your campaign's live, your customers are engaging with the awesome [PRODUCT-5] you created, and now you need to analyze your performance.
Agent: The system comes built with out of the box report, so you don't have to create reports from scratch. You have all the insights that you need.
Agent: And so instead of like, cobbling to the other reports and visuals and exporting data and importing data, you have these pre-built reports directly here that are highly visual. And you can filter these reports.
Agent: So I'm going to look at this in two parts. First are the out of the box reports, which, again, are just available directly.
Agent: Within the system and then you have advanced reports which [PERSON-3] can talk about in a fe w minutes that are an add-on to the standard reports that are available.
Agent: So in terms of th e out-of-the-box reports , Again, we know email is important to you. So the very first thing we're looking at here is a high level overview of your email campaign.
Agent: So the number of emails you've sent, the open rates, delivery, engagement. And as I look at performance, I can see the top five and the bottom five journey. So You don't see a lot of data here.
Agent: I apologize for that. But if I look here on the left, I can see that this fitness tracker is journey. Again, this is a demo environment.
Agent: So we have multiple people creating campaigns here is working well, whereas maybe some of these others are not working as well.
Agent: So this is a great data point for our team to say, you know, let's re-examine our post-purchase program, our post-purchase journey. Post-purchase journey here just means I bought a hardware analyzer.
Agent: Now I want to see what happens after that. And I want to do some kind of engagement. campaign to keep that individual top of mind, maybe sell them a service to you or sell th e [LOC-1] product.
Agent: So I can start to understand which of those journeys are performing at jus t like the highest, highest aggregate level .
Agent: Should you need to dig into the types of campaigns?
Agent: You can of course do that. So we talked about a welcome program. Yeah, promotional campaigns, journeys, and abandoned card journeys if you were to have ever have.
Agent: I don't know if your products are available online or not, but if they're not any type of journey, any type of campaign can be filtered down here as well.
Agent: Where we take this to the next level is where we start to dig into. Now let's look at, that was the aggregate level, let's start digging into whether or not your email campaigns are actually performing.
Agent: So what do your sends look like?
Agent: Are your emails reaching the inbox?
Agent: If they're not, well, they're apparently bouncing and what's the reason for that?
Agent: And we can start to access different views of that data to understand who we're sending to, when we're sending, and even the audience that we're sending to.
Agent: So are these customers, are these prospects?
Agent: Of these webinar attendees . we can start to understand the performanc e and understand if we're actually getting throug h our emails bouncing . they are, then maybe we need to course correct .
Agent: We can see in this email signup , a bounce rate .
Agent: Demo data, but if I saw that, I would be concerne d and I can now start to dig into , revisit that email signup [ORG-33] and understand why we're not getting through this , to this audience, excuse me .
Agent: It bad data ?
Agent: It old emails ?
Agent: Do we need to do some kind of campaign where we reach out on another channel?
Agent: Those types of insights can help us kind of understand what's happening behind the scenes.
Agent: So that's email overview, deliverability, and now we can start to actually get into are those emails being opened?
Agent: When are they opened?
Agent: Which audience is actually opening our email?
Agent: So top performing audiences. You can see that the newsletter has significant. Engagement, these are the unique open, so we're actually getting to the inbox and individuals are actually engaging with those emails as well.
Agent: And additional details on which messages are getting through here as well.
Agent: So I'm not going to show you every one of these reports in the interest of time, but just do know that you can get down to the email level and the success of each email and the performance of each one from an overall perspective.
Agent: And then you can also start to look at emails across the journey.
Agent: So if you have a post-purchase journey or a welcome journey or a re-engagement journey, you can start to understand what's happening at each step of that journey as well.
Agent: So highly granular, highly precise for you to be able to get to that . Those are out of the box reports.
Agent: Now, where we get a little bit more advanced is the reporting that's available in the cross-channel tab, and that's what you're looking at now.
Agent: So if I wanted to take this one step further, again, we talked about e-mail the web conversion, right, in terms of e-mail.
Agent: Integration with [ORG-21]. So again, [PERSON-5], you told us that [ORG-21] is very important. There's data data attribution. There's Marketing attribution campaign performance that that's highly important to you.
Agent: So what we're doing here is we're connecting [PRODUCT-3] data, those journeys to your email campaigns in [ORG-21]. So you can now start to understand.
Agent: Are your sins performing, not just from a delivery perspective and engagement perspective, which is what we just looked at in the out-of-box reporting, but on an ongoing basis, have your visitors hit your website and have they started to quote unquote convert in some ways.
Agent: Again, we can talk about what conversion means to you and what those conversion points are, but this is actually a good analysis of how your emails are performing from that initial send in the Marketing platform.
Agent: To ongoing activity so I can see conversions I can see the traffic that we're driving What are [DATE-6] If I know that [DATE-7] are a strong performer then more than likely I'll try to send on [DATE-8] s and [DATE-9] because those are my highest performing days Of course, someday we would expec t to be low performing so weekend But I can understand the best performing day average time that individuals are spending on the site all the metrics you need to understan d the performance .
Agent: An email to conversion [ORG-33]: And then as we're thinking about the last thing that I want to talk about here, as you're thinking about, you know, you talked, and I believe talked about link, I think it was LinkedIn ads or [ORG-32] ads, as you think about media performance and media optimization, you can connect and analyze your advertising across channels here as well.
Agent: So [ORG-34], [ORG-33], [ORG-32], and you can do that alongside your Marketing data. So you see your Marketing data here. And then you see the performance across those connected channels here as well.
Agent: So I can start to drill down into what is performing You have all those conversion data Our individual is actually visiting what the cost per visit is And then you have insights into what does my CPM look like What's my best performing campaign What's my worst performing campaign How much is it costing me So I can start to dig into those characteristics And I have insights available that summarizes al l of those findings for me directly here within the platform So .
Agent: A plethora of data available for you to dig in. And there are other cross-channel advanced intelligence reports here as well that we can certainly spend more time talking about as well.
Agent: Again, last thing that I wanted to kind of drive home here is that Integration with [ORG-21] is going to be very important.
Agent: So you can then start to track and analyze journey activity and that email-to-web conversion as well. And the beauty of the advanced reports is in the out-of-the-box reports. It's you're able to filter those down.
Agent: You can't really customize too much ther e But what you get here is the ability to be able to customize some of these reports if I go back to our [ORG-34] l view here if I have my email overview and let's say this wasn't the exact exact way you want to show the data, present the data.
Agent: You could share this data exactly as it is now. So again, you're not having to create that that [ORG-34] or any other type of PDF.
Agent: You can immediately export it from here, send it via email to anyone who needs to access this.
Agent: But more importantly, if I get in the edit mode, the advanced capabilities where I can then start to make this look like an [ORG-8] data.
Agent: So whether that's the layout, the backgrounds, the colors, the fonts again, from a branding perspective, you have that control And we make it really easy for you because if I could just upload your logo add a background image that's relevant for you we'll automatically pull those colors from your logo and give you a visuall y stunning dashboard just as a starting point very quickly in [TIME-11] And again, if I needed to filter this data and it's not exactly what I want to share with other stakeholders with the advanced reporting user .
Agent: Have the ability to be able to customize, agai n, not just the branding and the look and fee l, but the actual data and [ORG-21] that are available here as [PERSON-11]: Cool.
Agent: What questions can I answer about reporting?
Agent: Did I answer your questions?
Agent: Is there anything else that you have doubts about from a reporting perspective?
EndUser: So with the reporting, it sounds like the advanced reports are an add-on. So with the add-on, I'm going to assume, kind of like with the data, I could pull in beta from anywhere that has an API that connects.
Agent: Correct. Any data that's available within the platform, any data we have within the platform in those data tables, you have access to all of that data here. These were just kind of the out of the box.
Agent: You can start from scratch and build from scratch to your heart's desire. So you have lots of flexibility in terms of how to report on the data of your choice.
EndUser: Right. So like I wanted to do a report on. Okay. Everybody who attended a webinar.
Agent: In the past, Yeah.
EndUser: I want to see what emails they opened. To make those connections.
Agent: Sure. Yeah. And again, once [ORG-21] is integrated at the journey level, so we looked at that welcome journey, some of that will be available directly within the journey automatically because of that integration.
Agent: Once you integrate, you start to append those [ORG-10] parameters. You have some of those out of the box already directly within the journey.
Agent: But if you want to get more sophisticated and create something more custom, absolutely, you can do that on the reporting side. Okay.
EndUser: And one
Agent: Clarification I do wanna make is that it doesn't be an application that has open APIs.
Agent: Necessarily need to
Agent: So often times you're gonna work with many factors. You have legacy software, you're working your homegrown systems that might not have APIs or may have limited APIs.
Agent: That's where you can work with an integrator that can easily can implement an SFTV drop-through. So it's a file drop.
Agent: So if it's an [PRODUCT-8] spreadsheet that gets file dropped, you know, [TIME-13], whatever it is, that information can be available to you as well.
EndUser: Yeah, so just in
Agent: Terms of data, just to cap off our demo to the in terms of data, just think about data that you can bring in directly within the UI.
Agent: If you chose to do that data via file transfer arena, just describe. The best solution is the automation. Again, because you're using [ORG-5], you have access to that data through more automated means.
Agent: Typically, that's an API that we would set up for you as part of your initial partner implementation.
Agent: All that data, you define what data you need for marketing, for segmentation, for personalization, and for reporting purposes, and then you have access to that data across all those functions directly within [PRODUCT-3] engagement.
Agent: So that was an overview. Hopefully you found that helpful, but again, Marketing cloud, just to summarize what I showed you [DATE-1], how Marketing Cloud connects across your entire journey.
Agent: Hopefully you saw that [DATE-1] so you can deliver consistent value. You can unify all that relevant data. enable that real-time personalization and engage with your audience with that very personalized, hyper-dynamic content.
Agent: So our goal is to really help your team maximize your effectiveness with the insights, the capabilities, so we can drive overall customer value. And that's really the goal of Marketing Cloud engagement. Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, I love it. It's a lot. It's a, you know, it'd be a learning journey for us because it's so much more highly functional and advanced than what we're doing now.
EndUser: But I think if we took the time to learn it and maximize it, you know, I think we'll see a return on our investment. That the money part is not the part for me to decide.
Speaker 6: Part
EndUser: Of that too, [PERSON-5],
Agent: Is that you can meet one of our partners that we recommend for sort of quick <inaudible> like this. And they do include training as part of the They'll to do it.
Agent: Show. show you kind of how
Agent: Everything will be time stamp videoed, Recorded as well, and they can help you kind of really understand how to do it.
EndUser: Yeah, we will definitely need some training because it is so different than what we're doing now. And I don't think we're going to have trouble understanding it.
EndUser: I think what is going to be most useful is there is so much functionality. It's going to be for us to understand what all the functionality is at our disposal and which parts of it we're going to use.
EndUser: Absolutely.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: No, I was just going to say typically what we've seen is, you know, crawl walk run, right?
Agent: Let's start off with a baseline. Let's get the system set up, configure your data in. You start with some high level campaigns. Maybe it's a simple welcome campaign like the one we looked at.
Agent: You're starting to collect that data and then maybe you're then starting to orchestrate those multi-channel journeys.
Agent: So it really is a crawl walk run phase and really that's how we consult our clients is to really take it in that fashion versus, you know, obviously not trying to bite the whole, bite the whole apple in one bite.
Agent: So.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, it would be a lot. Well, that was very helpful is it was great to just see it and see how the functionality is different.
EndUser: [PERSON-14].
Agent: I think in a. second.
Speaker 6: We lost you for a
Agent: She might
Speaker 6: Go. Yeah.
Agent: We'll see you should come back in the meantime, wondering for the rock with you, what your feedback is, you know, does this suffice for what you're looking for, what you're hoping for in terms of an upgrade of part.
Speaker 6: In [TIME-14].
Agent: But Are there any other gaps or anything else that we're missing that we can cover?
Speaker 6: Honestly, no, it's I overload It's just kind of everything that we've been like begging for [DATE-10] now.
Speaker 7: Don't know. It's not information
Speaker 6: So it's really exciting.
Speaker 6: I hope It works out for our team like [PERSON-5] said we don't really have any like Decision like wait to the decision based on budgetary reasons and everything but I hope it all happens for us Yeah, anything's
Agent: Better than the part out
Speaker 7: That we've been working with. So anything like anything is better than what we've had. So this all looks awesome. He's your intuitive and great place for data management. So and I hope we make a decision towards it.
Speaker 8: I'm excited
Speaker 8: I think we would have been fine.
Speaker 8: Like if it was just the updated like email building, but all the other stuff is really exciting to like being able to navigate and look at like the past and to optimize those other tools as well.
Agent: Wonderful.
Speaker 7: [PERSON-5]'s PC crashed. So she will not be able to log back on. So she just wanted to extend her apologies.
Agent: No worries. Do either of you have sort of like her office line so that I could just set up next steps with her. I know [PERSON-6] wanted me to set up that call.
Speaker 6: She does not really have like used her office number. But I have her cell phone number.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, that would be great.
Speaker 6: It is 583. I want to. Sorry. I have four two zero one nine three.
Agent: Or two
Agent: Perfect. So. Yeah, we'll give her a quick call here instead of next steps in terms of budgeting and pricing.
Agent: That's sort of our job too, so we'll work with [PERSON-6] and try to see if we can get this to your hands.
Agent: But something we said within before too is part of it is something we've kept around as a legacy product because it's great for manufacturers that, you know, maybe there's someone that's like a one-person team that really has very simple needs that has been doing this forever and really just wants to do, you know, new slither class, but we understand you have a [ORG-40] team and you have a young team that is used to technology now I want to bring you kind of [ORG-34] to speed in the modern world .
Speaker 6: .
Agent: We'll be chatting
Speaker 6: With you . you .
Speaker 8: I'm excited to be
Speaker 6: There.
Agent: Wonderful. Well, thank you all and feel free to reach out to me if you have any other questions.
Speaker 6: Thank you guys.
Agent: Thanks everyone.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep asked several open-ended questions during the call to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""What questions can I answer for you on getting your data into the system?""
2. ""What questions can I answer for you on the first step here on getting the data that you need for better marketing?""
3. ""What questions do you have on this journey orchestration and how you would build this out?""
4. ""Do you have time to go over or should we schedule more time to dig into reporting? What works for you?""

These questions allowed the sales rep to understand the customer's needs and concerns better, and to tailor the conversation accordingly.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer seemed to be impressed with the capabilities of the seller's product and expressed excitement about its features. They mentioned that it has everything they have been ""begging for"" and is ""really exciting."" The customer also appreciated the potential for data management and optimization that the product offers. However, they did mention the need for training to fully utilize the product's functionality. Overall, it seems that the customer believes the product meets their needs and is hopeful for a decision in its favor.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current marketing solution and challenges. This would have helped the sales rep tailor the demo to better address the customer's specific pain points.
2. The sales rep briefly mentioned the possibility of integrating with the customer's service cloud, but did not explore this opportunity further. Understanding how the customer currently uses service cloud and how they could benefit from integrating it with the sales rep's product could have been a valuable opportunity to highlight the product's capabilities.
3. The sales rep mentioned the possibility of using data from the customer's service team for marketing campaigns, but did not delve deeper into this opportunity. Exploring the types of data the customer has access to and how it could be used in marketing campaigns could have been a valuable way to demonstrate the product's capabilities.
4. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep briefly mentioned the possibility of using the product for customer support, but did not explore this opportunity further. Understanding the customer's current customer support processes and how the product could be used to improve them could have been a valuable way to demonstrate the product's capabilities.
5. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's marketing goals and challenges in order to better tailor the demo to their needs. This would have helped the customer see the value of the product in addressing their specific pain points.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the personalization capabilities of the seller's product, specifically the ability to create dynamic content based on customer data. They also appreciated the multi-channel approach, including SMS functionality and the potential for integrating with third-party direct mail services. The customer mentioned that these features would be a significant upgrade from their current solution and would help them better engage with their audience.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The sales representative mentions setting up a call with the customer's colleague regarding budgeting and pricing, but the outcome of that conversation is not included in the transcript.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They expressed excitement about the features and capabilities of the seller's product, and mentioned that it meets their needs and is an upgrade from what they currently have. They also mentioned that they hope to make a decision towards it. However, the final decision will depend on budgetary reasons.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of articulating the value proposition of the product, Marketing Cloud engagement, by explaining its features and benefits in detail. They demonstrated how it can help the customer unify and activate relevant customer data, engage audiences with personalized content on their preferred channels, and gain insights to improve performance. The rep also provided examples of how customers have seen significant increases in engagement after using the product. However, there were a few areas where the rep could have further emphasized the value proposition:

1. Tailoring the demo to the customer's needs: While the rep did a good job of demonstrating the features of Marketing Cloud engagement, they could have tailored the demo more closely to the customer's specific needs and use cases. This would have helped the customer better understand how the product could solve their unique challenges and provide value to their organization.
2. Highlighting the differentiation from the customer's current solution: The rep mentioned that Marketing Cloud engagement has cross-channel capabilities, but they could have further emphasized how this differentiates it from the customer's current solution, which primarily uses email.
3. Emphasizing the potential cost savings: The rep mentioned that Marketing Cloud engagement can help the customer save costs by integrating with third-party apps like [ORG-33] for direct mail. However, they could have further emphasized the potential cost savings of using a single platform for marketing efforts, rather than relying on multiple tools and systems.
4. Providing more concrete examples of success: While the rep mentioned that customers have seen significant increases in engagement after using Marketing Cloud engagement, they could have provided more concrete examples of specific success stories or case studies. This would have helped the customer better understand the potential impact of the product on their own organization.
5. Addressing potential objections: The rep could have anticipated potential objections or concerns the customer may have had, such as the learning curve associated with a new platform or the cost of implementation. By addressing these objections proactively, the rep could have further emphasized the value proposition of Marketing Cloud engagement."
video_19783_167_6qr3y000000odR8AAI,"Agent: Okay, we're all good to go.
Agent: Thank you. And yeah guys, so as I mentioned, thanks a million for joining us [DATE-1]. In the interest of time, you want to get through as much of the demos possible. So I won't labor on this slide.
Agent: I know it's something that some of you have seen already, but just the set the scene in terms of what we're going to focus in on [DATE-1].
Agent: And we recognize that the challenge from we camera [PERSON-1] at the minute is the disconnect with sales in the multiple different ways you guys are using [ORG-1]. It's a little bit disconnected.
Agent: So I The idea is as the business grows and we allow for scalability, we need to ensure there is a level of ordination required to gain better insight into orders, stock allocations and manage that customer journey in a much more process driven way So the areas that we're going to focus on is as you have the order orchestration and [PERSON-2] this is very much what we had [DATE-2] in terms of improving visibility and allowing for forecasting understanding element th e So making sure that we can run reports and get a clear view on those supporting docs or indeed actually making those supporting docs embedded into sales so that they can really ta lk about better and we're not reliant on attached to our doc s. The future proof of a tech stack is also incredibly important as we look to grow on sca le in terms of offering a front end for B2B session, perhaps multi currency is t he exponents the [GPE-1] looking at potentially a partner [PERSON-3] but the idea is optimizing your current sales force infrastructure and ensuring that it is [ORG-2] ure proofed for that ability to scale and grow as you enter new markets and switching on a differ ent functionality is as easy as what we wanted before you.
EndUser: Of
Agent: Last but not least a couple of points th ere in terms of [GPE-2]'s easy use, make changes, allow for better business efficiencies and opti mal visibility is really what we're gearing towards here and then of [PERSON-4] taking into account each buyer group and the different type of scenarios or workflows that they may fol low, which I think CC is going to touch on.
Agent: But all in all, what we want to do [DATE-1] is exemplify our ability to automate the sales business proc ess, provide better visibility and allow for a seamless ordering process for all buyer gro ups, inclusive, relevant workflows, and supporting docs from our H [ORG-3].
Agent: Do keep in mind that what we're showing [DATE-1] is the commerce element of this proj ect, but it wo n't.
Agent: Run in isolation, [PERSON-5] and I will work to make sure that it is complimentary to the re st of yourselves for <inaudible> second at all runs way to ward.
Agent: So, um, [ORG-4], what I'll do is stop presenting and hand over
Agent: To you if that's okay. Yeah, sure. So I have my seat of coffee, so I'm ready to go. I'm joking. So morning, everyone, as [ORG-5] said, we had great conversation with all of you and it was great.
Agent: We understand how come our metric is looking.
Agent: To grow and kind of deliver this idea of automation from the order fulfillment, aggregate kind of like the order doesn't matter if it's a customer or an installer or how or so you kind of manage the kind of the order capture.
Agent: So across this demo and you can see a lot of things like healthy stuff and very kind of cereal bar and so on. Just to say that the scene, don't get hooked on a product.
Agent: What we're going to focus is on the journey of the customer, how they're logging, how they go through the experiences. We are going into have maybe around like four different kind of mai n Yes, sure, you admit you.
Agent: Hi, [PERSON-6]. So hi, hi, [PERSON-6], you just don't write on time.
Agent: Cool.
Agent: So here. Right. So sorry. That's fine. You're right on time. This Don't worry about it.
Agent: Is like you just perfectly on time.
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: So as I was saying, we are going to try to cover about four different topics and the question that have raised across our conversation [DATE-2], a conversation that we had with [PERSON-7] [DATE-3], so it's kind of multiple journey.
Agent: What we're going to talk about is that the main idea of the [PRODUCT-1], how a buyer, and I'm purposely going to call it a buyer, can navigate through the self-service experience, how you can manage the order capture.
Agent: And again, this is kind of been materialized to you agents to you direct customer, to yo u and direct customer to your resailors and so on What we're going to do, just according to the time we're going to go through one journe y to show you how you can orde r how the self-service experience looked like Then we're going to flip the coi n and then we're going to see when an order is submitted what is happening, what is the kind of like self-servic e and kind of like automation that you can provide to your service agent Doesn't matter, we're going to go throug h a kind of like a self-service type of wa y when you capture an interrogation from a customer from a chatbot, but again, it's just an idea of how to capture the elemen t. You The third party is going to show you how you can also kind of cater for multiple type of product.
Agent: As much as the first experience is going to focus on product goods, the second one, and I think it was mentioned by [PERSON-7] [DATE-3], he was talking about like service, all this licensing, how you can deliver that, how you can cater for the different product and so on.
Agent: So we're going to touch based on this one as well. And the last piece is that how you can personalize this from a design perspective, how you can organize those different things is kind of.
Agent: Creating one experience with one offering that [ORG-6] has, but depending who' s lugging in what they're going to have access to, what they can buy from you, what they ca n reorder and so on.
Agent: Again, I want the decision to be interactive. We have [TIME-1], [PERSON-8] s if I stop in [PERSON-9] . What we're going to do is that we're going to cover this. I want the decision to be interactive.
Agent: So if you have any questions, feel free to pop any that you have.
Agent: Ok?
Agent: [PERSON-10] up, come up, mute, chapter, any form of questions are welcome. Hi, [PERSON-13].
Agent: Yes?
EndUser: I
Speaker 8: Was just letting you know why they're still alive.
EndUser: Thank
Agent: You very much. I appreciate it. So there we go.
Agent: Can everyone see my screen to start with?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Ok, perfect.
Agent: So what we're going to start with?
Agent: Thank you. So what we're going to start with is the journey of [PERSON-6]. So [PERSON-6] is an existing customer of [ORG-7], [ORG-7] partner.
Agent: [ORG-7], as you can see, this sell a very healthy stuff like cereal bars, energy drinks, and so on. What we're going to do is that here kind of going through an opt-in experience. So it's an existing customer.
Agent: This is your first realization kicks in.
Agent: When we talk about delivering an experience to different audiences, this is how it works All the screen that we're going to go throug h are template screen is drag and drop experienc e based on the [ORG-8] that we hav e and I'm going to touch based on Again, if you experience needs to be pixel [GPE-3] t from a camera metric perspective, branding and so on it's totally possible and we're going to touch base d on it as well So as you can see here, it's the standard landing page Loved in experience, [PERSON-15] just login with her emai l and a password that has been provide d by camera metric From that standpoint, everything that she's going to see and act on or have access to is based on her navigatio n. She had a negotiated relationship with [PERSON-11] being said, here, just for the purpose of the demo, we're going to go through existing customer s, but nothing stops you to create what we call a guest-prosing experienc [PERSON-11] that doesn't know you with a simple URL, definition of SEO, they can find your websit e. They are able to order, so you don't [PERSON-11] don't miss.
Agent: As much as you're creating retention and loyalty with your current customer, you can also capture a new busine ss. So here this is [PERSON-15].
Agent: As you can see here, we are going to kind of sparkle around this experience a lot of reminder that it's a co-branding experience.
Agent: So from the top here, as you can see, and here this is where the company that [PERSON-15] is working on, but she's navigating through [ORG-7].
Agent: From that standpoint, it's just kind of like a reminder that [PERSON-15] is navigating through an experience that is designed for her because [PERSON-19] knows her.
Agent: Here it's [ORG-7] partner, but the company that she's navigating through, sorry, and has a commercial relationship.
Agent: She knows her and she can kind of like navigate in safety She doesn't have to ask question if she has access to this product or not or if she can order everything is designed for her .
Agent: So as you can see here on the top page, we have access to different tile menus, can be definition of like product categories, could be also some actions.
Agent: Here you can have business insights, you can have way to order, and we kind of kind of process this for like most kind of like [ORG-9] customers. I think a question has been raised [DATE-3].
Agent: You have some customer who come to you and they're not looking for a specific product or defined packages, but they just want that to order and bulk.
Agent: Five camera, [DATE-4], [DATE-5], and they can order in grid if they wanted to.
Agent: Also, the loyalty here, as you can see is just the internal aspect that you can define If you don't have the loyalty, earning point, and so on you can define this with the customer But what we're going to focus on is the commerce experience itself Here, when you scroll down, you're having a welcome banner defining that here every banner can be different coloring depending on who's logging in and how we navigate to it Easy things that you're going to access catalog but we're going to leave this for a second We're scrolling down And again, this is a - reminder that it's a personalized experienc e. Like we literally have like a, an image, a photo of [PERSON-15], we know who she i s. And it's kind of like mirroring a lot of B2C experien ce in the B2B world as much as we need to be [PERSON-19] Like not spending [TIME-2] to be able to capture orde r. What we're looking at is that like a personalizatio n. We need to know how and where we can act on the produc t. So we don't have to think [PERSON-21] We don't have to go through thousands approval [PERSON-19]: Everything is divine for this relationshi p. business to business. Here it's a B2B experience, but [PERSON-15] could have been a single custo mer like me think about this [ORG-10] like experience, which doesn't have an account.
Agent: She does n't act on behalf of the company. [PERSON-15] could have been an individual person and just hav ing a loved experience because she's a cannot locate on this brand as we ll.
Agent: When you scroll down here, you can see that [PERSON-15] has access to, if she wanted to, from the get-go, what we call in it is like a one-stop-flop experience.
Agent: The first thing that she can do is that kind of creating a new message. She has questions, she has an interrogation, could be some knowledge about the product, could be someone that she needed to reach out to.
Agent: You can deliver this experience to [PERSON-15] from a self-service instead of picking up the phone, reaching out emails, having those back and forth with customers. Any concerns or questions that she has can be captured here.
Agent: As you can see, it's a kind of HTML form, going to be captured as a case internally, using a Service Cloud so you know how you capture this. This can be processed through queue.
Agent: You can even decide to have more detailed and sliders, because depending on the question that [PERSON-15] has, it could be sent to product. It could be sent to the customer.
Agent: And to sales or even customer support This is one of the kind of actio n that only I can have from the get go But then when we're scrolling dow n from a commercial standpoint this is where we're going to have the personalization So as you can see here, we call it kind of lik e the center control This is where [PERSON-15] managed a different kind of order Again, we're talking about her being an existing customer So she navigated through the platform She created her different lists depending on what she needs For example, those are the products recommende d by [ORG-13] potentially product launch for different idea s. Here, it's kind of like the same idea, but for a specific event that you need to hos t. As you can see here, those product links can be rename d, delayed, you can create a new one from the scratc h. What you can do is that you can decide to delete any it em or even convert this full list into an orde r. So you can leverage it as a wishlis t. You can decide to leverage it as an order template if you wanted [PERSON-17]: It's helping you kind of tracking your customer intere st or kind of like incentivize your custome [NORP-1] support to be able to push maybe targeting or providing s ome traditional promotion into th at.
Agent: The second layer is that, again, we're talking about the next existing relationship. And we give to [PERSON-15] a view of her previous orders.
Agent: Here could be orders, could be subscription, and we're going to touch base this in the second part of this demo.
Agent: But here is to kind of see like all the order that [PERSON-15] has processed through times here, as you can see, you have an exhaustive list, maybe not like very nice and very design newies, but you can decide the number of lines that you wanted to provide her here.
Agent: I provide like quite 10, but you can decide to have only three if you wanted to. It's just drag and drop in the design of the expression.
Agent: You can decide to filter from the first time that you ordered Here what she can do is that she easily can kind of decide to reorder the same product that she needed to Think about those more consumable that you have Think about those different things Here at the system again, we're talking about this kind of connected experience We are able to provide information to [PERSON-15] that those products are not available So the product that she wants to reorder are not available as we speak [DATE-1] They are out of stock .
Agent: Here, as the information is static, you can decide to give her the possibility to preorder or give her the possibility to just move forward with the rest of the product that she has in her cart.
Agent: And this is going to be directly linking her to her cart as we speak. Yep. Going too fast.
Agent: Here, as you can see, all those different layers are kind of like manageable from the way that [PERSON-15] wants to manage her experiences.
Agent: Then here, when we talked about cases, what you can do is that when [PERSON-15] raised the case, when she asked the questions about a product or specific thing, she wants to make sure that [PERSON-21] is kind of taking care of the questions.
Agent: They are able to support her moving forward from that. So as you can see here, it's the list, again, like a recap of all the latest cases that [PERSON-15] has processed through times.
Agent: We can see the different channels, the subject, we can even kind of add it again because it's a fiel d and we can have added a filter, a kind of specific retiree of the statue of the specific order All those different lengths are manageable as well .
Agent: Here, when we're scrolling down, we have different information, such as here you have the cart upload. Again, some customers, and this is, you think about mass order. They don't have to navigate through the store.
Agent: What they want to do is that they have an [PRODUCT-2] spreadsheet. They have a large company. What they want to do is to over order the camera because they're coming out of date.
Agent: Or they're having a new fleet that they're going to hire.
Agent: What you can do is simply upload, you see as you find, or even your text file, and decide to convert this directly into an order if you want to take it. Thanks for watching .
Agent: But then here, when we're going to go through this kind of experiences, what we're going to do is to drill down into the experience and the catalog itself.
Agent: So after navigating through the account, and again, this is a template to you, it's a really high level.
Agent: Everything that we saw from the homepage can be tailored based on what you need to deliver, what you need to be exposed to your customer.
Agent: If it's a case, if it's questions, if it's information about your branding, if it's a product lunch as well for the banner standpoint, you can do this as well.
Agent: The second layer of this [PRODUCT-1] is also the catalog You can have free products as well from a service standpoint .
Agent: Yes, [PERSON-5]. CC, I was just going to just pause to see if anyone had any questions, maybe.
EndUser: On that point, I know it's just thinking of a question there because a lot of the stuff that we are dispatching other customers or sales
EndUser: Sorry, so a lot of the orders that you face are bundles where they have to choose what configuration they want.
EndUser: Is that possible to the system where they would choose that they want a, say a drive 315 which is our DVR plus three cameras. They then have
Agent: To specify which three cameras. Oh, I don't have it in this demo, but what you're talking about is just the variation.
Agent: Basically, what you can have is that for the purpose of this demo, what I have is that like a static product and I was going to go through the catalog here and to define the idea of like the core, the statue, the inventory and so on.
Agent: Here, as you can see, you have a single product. Here, instead of having a variation, it could be a bundle.
Agent: And then you can have the list of you collect a product set that is pulled together or that, instead, what you can have is that a link of like recommended product.
EndUser: All the bundled product
Agent: So even if you buy the main one, you can add the one that you want.
Agent: As a group or individually So this is one way of having static product But then if you said that you have some configuration nothing stops you to have different start sliders even if this screen is showing one product on the back of it, you can have 175 variation s based on the selection that you're going to make Maybe here we're talking about drinks so it could be the pack, it could be the flavor it could be the delivery stages All those different things can be helping yo u to have
EndUser: This variation order from that [ORG-15].
EndUser: And is this the way that you would recommend for the sales people to loan the customers?
Agent: Orders or is this more just focused on We have customers and this is what I said this time. The direct buyer. So she needed like when we're going, what we're going through is that [PERSON-15] had on the store.
Agent: She's like owning a store and she's buying this for like her her ails and so on.
Agent: But in the camera magic setting, you can have this defined for, as you said, you sell straps or going into use it, you can have this for your customers and you can even have this for your installers We talked about this kind of stuff that you're losing because the kind o f installers have those packs into the van.
Agent: So you don't have a track of the inventory What you can have is that based on what they need, based on the different spare part, the y can use that as well.
Agent: So here, as you can see here, it's a quite standard page and it's kind of like , Product name, you have the different pricing. Again, we're talking about negotiated relationship. The pricing can be different depending who's logging in.
Agent: The essence of this navigation is based on what we call a buyer group. A buyer group is a collection of element that is going to drive the experience.
Agent: From a buyer standpoint, doesn't matter if it's an customer, a reseller, a salesperson is going to be personalized. From camera matrix, it's just going to be a standardization and a segmentation of the customers.
EndUser: Does [PERSON-19] saw your question?
EndUser: It was a long monologue.
EndUser: Yeah, I suppose I was just thinking there when you had the CSV file, if they were to, if they were putting in an order for a hundred packs of drinks, but 28 were cola, 11 were seven off and, you know,
Agent: Is it easier to do it this way or is it easier to do it through those CSV file?
Agent: So it depends what type of customer do you have. You have customers who need to navigate through this catalog. Again, and I was talking about here when I was mentioning the catalog navigation.
Agent: We have this idea where the customer needs to navigate. They need to go through facets. So as you can see here, you have a product catalog.
Agent: You can care about what?
Agent: Million, 5 million of different products, spare parts, and so on. Based on what you're looking for, you have a dynamic kind of filters. Based on my selection, as you can see, the filter is going to be updated.
Agent: And I'm going to find a different product. It's one way to look for product if you wanted to.
Agent: But then the second way is that if you know the customer and the customer knows exactly the product they want to buy, they don't want to add anything.
Agent: Doesn't matter the CSV, every single product has a located to a skew.
Agent: So as long as the CSV file has the skew and the quantity, the skew can be only done for [ORG-11], [ORG-11], [ORG-11], Pac-28, every single skew is going to be gathered. So you don't have to move.
Agent: Care, I would say, because the CSV file is going to get off for every single entity into it and it's going to kind of convert it into an order So if you have [ORG-11], [GPE-4], energy drink, [PERSON-17], and you have berries, because you have this cube, then you're going to convert it is going to directly convert to those different products In the cart level, when I'm going to add those different products, you're going to see the image of each one .
Agent: The thing is that both ways are good. Both ways are good. Navigation or cart upload. I think it's more a business decision.
Agent: See what you sell people are responding to because those both route to order are out of the box.
Agent: The solution is providing it and it's just a matter of providing the aspect of if you want to do a CSV file or if you want to order from the catalog. It's just matter of configuration
EndUser: Basically. OK.
Agent: Any other questions?
Agent: Okay, so we talked about the catalog here, kind of navigating through different aspects around kind of like the different product and so on.
Agent: Every information related to your product that can help your customer to find what they need can be defined here as a facet, as I said earlier, could be one way for the customer to search.
Agent: Imagine those customers of yours are kind of like stick to one single product and they buy the full set, but they have one consumable of the fact that they bought kind of like not working anymore and they don't want to go through that.
Agent: They don't want to go through that. whole punk because they want to save costs. You can decide to have all those products here Here, those products are kind of like looked from [GPE-5] and it's quite easily.
Agent: But we even hav e some customer who add the layer of kind of customization and deliver what we call the barcodes .
Agent: Is just a customization and I think this is what we touched based on [PERSON-28] last time, is that you can kind of reference that this is what I'm going to focus on is really the out-of-the-box type of capability that you can leverage by [DATE-6].
Agent: But nothing stops you to facilitate the life of you installers or yourselves, people and so on to add a layer, a kind of like additional level of effort in the future and to decide to have this kind of kind of to convert to a current instead of like navigating for the catalogue as well.
Agent: For this demo and for the conversation that we're having [DATE-1], I'm really trying to show you what the solution is and what you can deliver by [DATE-6]. Okay.
Agent: From here to [DATE-7], but yeah, you get the ideas which is out of the box cap for capabilities.
Agent: Okay, so when we talked about the catalog and finding the right product, so for example, here I'm looking for like a different tease, you have the packaging, you have the type, all those different fields are part of like the product and the offering that you're delivering.
Agent: You just decide to allocate this as a searchable field in terms of facets. The searchable field can also be part of here, the account of experience. Let's say here, I'm looking for a shy product.
Agent: Here what you're going to have in looking for a specific type product when I'm going to do my search.
Agent: All the product, again, at defined specific search item, the system is going to kind of show me all the product that I'm looking for. Again, I don't know the SKU specifically. I know the name of the product.
Agent: I remember the color and so on. The searchable field, again, based on the product are defined by camera metrics. Everything is like to make this experience from a customer standpoint as seamless as possible.
Agent: Again, a B2B or even a B2C relationship here, a customer doesn't spend [TIME-3] on this website.
Agent: So as much as you can provide them the tool and the experience to kind of be able to add the different product they wanted to record, it's kind of like a really good point.
Agent: Again here, it's a [ORG-11] company. We're looking at specific drinks, flavor and so on.
Agent: Camera magic could be a laser focus of the camera, could be the capacity, could be the saving battery, could be all those different elements coming together as well.
Agent: Here, for example, you can see that even kind of this logging experience, and we said that this existing relationship, [PERSON-15] is based on is allocated to a specific buyer group.
Agent: So here, again, we have a reminder that [PERSON-15] has access to a different pricing, price list than like a public customer.
Agent: For example, here, we have two different pricing, the public price that anyone can have access when we talked about this guest browsing experience, if you wanted to, but then the discounted price because she's a non-customer.
Agent: She's loyal to us, and we have a contracted relationshi p basically She can add this product to the cart kind of like decide to continue her experienc e or even click on another one two see what exactl y this product is about .
Agent: Again, and we're going to touch based on when we're going to process the order. But here, this is a view of how this product looks like. As you can see here, we touch based a little bit on it.
Agent: The idea of having a product image, you can have up to a different image to the product. You can enrich this product knowledge as much as you want. We have some customer who very detailed.
Agent: They need to provide as much information that the customer need before moving forward, because it's kind of like helping them create the conversion.
Agent: We have some customers, very simplistic because their customer knows the product What they want to do is to make sure that they have access to the right <inaudible> e if there is any associated discount and to move forward Here for the purpose of this demo, what I wanted to show you is a little bit of both So you kind of again here having kind of like the idea of her price the original price of this product She can decide to add it to the cart or add it to the list that we saw a minute ag o because she may not be ready to move forward with it But then below that because of this specific experience and the specific price list that [PERSON-15] has access to, what we' re making available to her is what we call a tier pricing because [PERSON-15] is a volu me customer of us.
Agent: She buys a lot. So what we're going to do is to emphasize the idea of [PERSON-28] for her.
Agent: For example, here, as you can see, if I'm like literally putting like a quanti ty of [DATE-8] item, the product is dynamically going to be reducing based on the quanti ty that she's going to add.
Agent: For example, here, if I put 0. the price is going to decrease. Here you can easily add it to the card and still navigate into the page here.
Agent: When you're going to see to the page, I'm going to bring your attention to the left side of the screen when you have different information based on the inventory. And I know this is crucial.
Agent: All those information are coming for [ORG-19]. Those screen are kind of just exposed to [PERSON-15] so she knows the different locations, the product where they are located.
Agent: If it's internal to [ORG-7], if [ORG-7] is going to have to reach out to a supplier to get this information.
Agent: Product produced, potentially, all those different layer can be talked about And we even kind of like talking, we kind of exposing her to kind of like expected shippin g date so she know when she can expect the order that she wanted to When we're scrolling down, we're going just to provide more information about the product As you can see here, we have the different specs about like the flavor, the type an d the packs We can even provide like support video based on each product Each product will have different video if you wanted to because t o kind of help the customer to make [PERSON-28] goes with the resources.
Agent: You can have some documentation here. It's nutritional information and more information about [ORG-7]. It could have been a user kit, it could have been an instructions, all those different information that laid down as well.
Agent: And then here again you have different kind of aspect here for the purpose of this demo. What you can do is to import your own stock. So we have visibility on what you have.
Agent: This is more kind of a [ORG-11].
Agent: So I'm not going to spend too much time on it, but just to have a rationality between what you have in stock and what the customers should be able to kind of have a certain recurrancy as well.
Agent: And then here, when we talk about the recommended product, here, as you can see, this is the kind of like associated relationship.
Agent: Every time that you're going to add this product here, when you're going to have this specific relationship, every time we have a certain behavior that customer are buying, for example, the tart cherry chicken bar, what you can do is that you can create relationship as a recommended product.
Agent: The relationship can be complementary, or even could be upsell as well. Everything is really up to the business. You can make it as independent.
Agent: If the customer wants or don't want to add it to the cart and just click on this button or you can make it as a bundle as we just talked about You can make it as a product set where the customer wants to move forward or not with it .
Agent: But for the time being, [PERSON-15] is happy with what she searched when she added the product to the cart, and she's moving out to the cart
EndUser: Level.
EndUser: Any question?
Agent: Before I move forward to the screen?
Agent: No question. OK, cool. So here, this is the card. So you can see here we added two different products with different packs. Again, for the purpose of the demo to show you how the different product works.
Agent: As you can see, you can decide to have a recurring order. And again, this is kind of more kind of a physical product. Let's say that the recurring order can be done for you installers.
Agent: Because they're going to have a pack and they're going to have their van needs to be fulfilled. So they don't have time to go [DATE-9] and to kind of making sure they have.
Agent: Five different packs ready to go in the van.
Agent: All the salespeople are kind of like reordering for some customers of theirs because they're going to have a large project and for [DATE-10] they're going to maybe order like 97 camera because they're building their new fleet.
Agent: It's a new business as well. So it's something to consider as well. hear what we have, hear what we have and we're going to move forward with it.
Agent: Here, this is what we're going to go to the checkout aspect. Here, for the purpose here, you can have all the checkout in one screen, kind of like, resuming everything such as shipping information.
Agent: You can have even a requested date to making sure that the buyer is ordering on the behalf of the customer to make sure someone is like there to collect, or maybe the installer here is the one who's acting here.
Agent: He's going to come to a specific point that the camera metric is delivering to him.
Agent: So he wants to be delivered [DATE-13] because he has a has like three intervention and he has enough materia l in his van to move forward All those different lengths and variation are totally possible This is what I meant in terms of like self-service Here we're going for [ORG-19], which is kind of straightforward But the variation, depending on who's buyin g or whose kind of need a certain stock or new member of product can be also cared for For example, here you also have the delivery method Depending the customer, you can have multiple deliver y methods Here you have the standard one just to kind of like the idea But you can have them one single one are at least not even expos ed because whoever order is going to be fulfill ed and delivered by camera magic as [PERSON-31] Everything here can be cared fo r. Here, for example, we're going to go through the free shipping.
Agent: Every step here can be a mandatory field. So for example, if I don't select any delivery method, the screen wouldn't let me replace the order. Same goes as the payment.
Agent: From an out-of-the-box perspective, the solution delivers two different payment authorization that you can extend the solution to. Here, it's credit card and purchase order.
Agent: But nothing stops you to involve things such as internal payment processing, such as we talked about invoicing, potentially. We talked about POs.
Agent: All those different things can also be cared for Here, for example, I'm going to go through the [LOC-1] moving forward with it and kind of like processing the order .
Agent: Again, the payment here would be more for an buyer, but maybe some installers of yours wouldn't have to pay. What they would have is that not having the payment option.
Agent: What they would have is just to be able to capture and deliver the product that they need as well. So here from that standpoint, as you can see, the order has been submitted.
Agent: We have an order number, we have all the different information, and we are able to track it.
Agent: If we come in back to the homepage, we're going to see a quick update like in real-time that the order that we've been submitted is already processed through the system.
Agent: The order has been created and the statue is creating and waiting to be fulfilled. So for the user experience from a common app
EndUser: Like product standpoint, physical product that camera matrix is offering, this is what I wanted to show you.
EndUser: Any other question before we kind of switching to the auto management piece?
EndUser: Yeah. So it's stock control.
Agent: Not really going to act.
EndUser: It's kind of like, so one was all our case, camera matrix. Um, I have a question. Yeah, sure. I'm just wondering from the finance point of view, we're talking about stock movements here.
EndUser: How is that Recorded and is it possible to see. Like is there a [NORP-2] entry scene generated or. Is it linking to.
Agent: It's like, right, because I mean, moving stuff I want to know. Hey, so I have a hospital, I do have discharged one that can work out and it is all over.
Agent: I think takes us half time to take that record team kept here. So the record and this is what we're going to talk about a second, [ORG-19].
Agent: And if there is no more questions into the [GPE-6], I can fit to the [ORG-19] part directly now.
Agent: So because it's going to answer your question, [PERSON-28], like, if it's stored here, how the relationship works with your current system and your system of like truth, my understanding is that all the information are like in the ERP.
EndUser: Around the kind of
Agent: Yeah, okay, cool. So this is the part that we're going to cover because this is kind of focusing on the order capture.
Agent: It's one of the kind of variation that you can have is that having those different audiences of yours, how they go into process or instead of having emails back and forth, numbers of phone, not trustability of the part that has been sent.
Agent: And my understanding is that camera magic has.
Agent: A kind of like a standard process where as soon as there is an order process, there is a pack send, but not necessarily the need of the full package and so on, all this complexity and Losing inventory, visibility as well, can be managed when you have this process into place.
EndUser: And stocks
Agent: When everything is traced, every product, even a pack or spare part, I identify as a single item, you're able to process this from an order perspective.
Agent: It's not something that is done from your team as a self-service, all those information I capture directly from the customer, installers or potentially, you sell straps.
Agent: So here, when we switching around is that we are shifting to the console of order management.
Agent: So order management, if you kind of like familiar with those screens because you're using service and sales at the moment, is exactly the same line of engagement. Everything that we're talking about is based on the [ORG-1] platform.
Agent: What we have here is that the Waffle. The Waffle is kind of having like the full suite of [ORG-1] product. Those product are not integrated. They're just part of the same ecosystem.
Agent: They are shared data model We're talking about the same account same order, same product, same contacts Everything is kind of consolidating to one view As you can see here, we have Service Cloud we have B2B [ORG-21] and we have order management The focus that we're going to have is tha t this specific line of engagement which is order management As you can see here from the get-go we have a screen Screen with the basic dashboard capability that are provided with the solution giving you a Snapchat of the activity around the inventory .
Agent: What we have. the latest order, the order exceptions, the returns, and so on. To answer your question, [PERSON-28], is that this solution is a consolidated view of what is happening in the ERP. We're not erasing what is happening.
Agent: We just integrate with your current solution that are the system of truth. But what we can do is act on those different behaviors.
Agent: For example, here, when I'm going to the order summary, capturing all the orders here in particular, I focused on a order that has been processed through the e-commerce platform.
Agent: But it could have been in order submitted by a sales re p through a direct input It could have been an order coming from EDI It could have been an order come from [ORG-19] any channel that you're selling into This is the great thing by [ORG-19] is that it's only channel It's not only focusing to the online it could be also some offline sales channe l that you have as well You have a very consolidated vie w based on the order that has been kind of processed which is kind of like the outstock but also what is the other ability in the ER P. The thing is that when you have those two different information, you are able to aggregate the different requests.
Agent: For example, here if we go to [ORG-17], is it processed already?
Agent: Yes, perfect.
Agent: So here, like, for example, here, if you go to the full process here, and you have visibility on the order, as you can see here, you have a full screen of the order, the different stages that are defined.
Agent: Again, all the level here in familiar with [ORG-1] can be tailored to the processes that cameramatic have in terms of like here, the order has been activated.
Agent: Or if the product between the creation and the activation, some customer are looking for what we call it. period of grace.
Agent: They need to have [TIME-4] between two because they need some kind o f logistic or manual input from internally.
Agent: But you can easily automated it because yo u know that the system is going to aggregate and ask the kind of question from differen t systems. You can move forward with that. Same goes like approval.
Agent: It could be one ste p of yours. Maybe you have a certain threshold and there may be 46k. You don't need, again I'm going big here, but like 46k, you don't have the customer to get an approval.
Agent: Bu t above that you need a certain approval to make sure that it's the right custome r, the right product, may be having a more key account type of relationship with those customer s. Or even it can be an approval done externally.
Agent: Think about those more customers of your s. The intern is managing the order.
Agent: As you said, he can kind of fill up the CSV fil e, processing the order moving forward, but then he's not able to process the paymen t. He needs some approval.
Agent: So you can have two layers of that as well.
Agent: If you want to a dd additional level of report as well her e. then the order is approved, kind of rejected, picked up, waiting for fulfillment because the information has been said and their location is kind of in processed, partially fulfilled.
Agent: This is kind of very interesting and astonishing based on the conversation that we have with [PERSON-7]. Think about those hybrid orders.
Agent: When you have those packages, when you have a camera, you have like different product with associated with it, but you also have a software license. So basically you have two different type of fulfillment.
Agent: You have a physical fulfillment that is going to require to have access to ERP and those kind of like product to be able to trigger the kind of like fulfillment.
Agent: But you also have the part of what we call the [GPE-7] fulfillment. And it's going to be auto provisioning or it's going to be someone to kind of creating the credential for the right customers.
Agent: This is also totally possible. When you're scrolling down, this is where you have the detail of the order, how you can act.
Agent: So as you can see here, I could have easily, if I flip again, fear from the customer, I could have easily, let's say the customer has a specific questions, and we can process this through time.
Agent: Like literally, I'm looking for an order of dates here. Again, from self-service experience, an integration could be damaged, could be anything. Here we're going to start the chat.
Agent: This conversation is going to be highlighted and the customer is going to receive an information.
Agent: So as you can see here, we are going to have a kind of like two different way to answer the customer, to save time, to kind of light up the workload from your customer services or potentially your sales reps.
Agent: But we're going to start with kind of a script and kind of like different action that the customer can do independently to save time to your internal teams.
Agent: Basically looking for a simple kind of order update Basically, the system is going to kind of like for what every order that you pass throug h maybe [DATE-15] is up to camera magic how much you want to define that I want to have an update on the one that has been passed like [DATE-11] ONS is going to kind of provide all the updated information that the customer needs As you can see here, we have the order number, the amount spent, the statue of it, and eve n the tracking shipment Again, this extension can allow us to go to the third part to see where is my order in real [PERSON-23] If camera magic is taking ownership of the [ORG-21] ry could be embedded here, or if you can kind of ha ve an extension to a put-by-party syste m, you can provide the link for your customer as [PERSON-31] So they can track where is the ord supposed to be delivere d. Then what you would like to do, let's say that we're going for the worst-care scenario and I want to report a damage because I received some cable damage from the order that I ordered.
Agent: Here again, they ask us what do you want to do?
Agent: Yes, it's about the specific order and I have questions about it. I want to be someone to be able to help me.
Agent: Again, here, taking the one that I processed on [DATE-11], Moving forward with this, again, the system is going based on my selection, provide me some multiple actions.
Agent: As you can see, what type of issue?
Agent: Missing, damaged, the product wasn't there, the order hasn't been received late and so on.
Agent: Again, all those different actions are going to trigger a specific queue and a flow in the back end that they're going to allow you to talk to here for our example.
Agent: What we're going to do is that let's say that the order hasn't been received, even if it has not fulfilled, what we're going to do comes from problems. And not . received.
Agent: Here and then the actions from that standpoint is like what they would like to do.
Agent: Let's talk to an agent and again we're going to kind of like do scenarios can be so multiple could be simple wisdom where is my order as soon as I have the information I'm good to go.
Agent: I want to talk about your return.
Agent: I want to have additional information as soon as we saw a captured capture of a form which is quite static you can decide to have additional information and kind of talk to someone directly.
Agent: So if we go back here into our internal channel.
Agent: Is it working?
EndUser: Yeah. I'm just in my time. I think for me personally, it's drilling down into that industry management team rather than customer experience.
EndUser: It's a possible to show that because the law virus is the order we place by ourselves, guys, then somebody internally will qualify it.
EndUser: So it's loaded almost as a bundle, then somebody will determine, right, these are the parts that you need to make sure that this is right. That then creates a pit list for the fulfillment element.
EndUser: And I think a lot of people on the call here are really interested to see about how the stock movements are managed
Agent: And Recorded and how that would then integrate them.
EndUser: I think I could stop want it .
Agent: It for the second part, but we didn't like not looking at how any questions moving forward and looking Okay sure so you
EndUser: At this from more and I turn on the first slide. Yeah okay sure
Agent: No problem.
Agent: Here, like, this is the order management. So it doesn't matter, as I mentioned earlier, how the order has been captured. If it's been captured from e-commerce and so on, you have a full list here of the different orders.
Agent: You can have different kind of categorization of lists if the order has been done through the B2B commerce, if it's done through [ORG-19], or if it's like from different kind of like cell straps as well.
Agent: Based on different skills, those kind of been allocated to who you need to be allocated to. As we talked about here, for example, if we go to a fulfilled order, let's this one .
Agent: This one we kind of having a trigger that has been done all around behalf, which means that this order has been done from a sales rep on behalf of the customer. Internally, the customer has made a request.
Agent: Let's say the sales rep has visited the customer, they had a conversation, and they process an order from that.
Agent: Here, as you can see, we have the total order of the total amount of the order with the different kind of shipping add-on and so on.
Agent: We have the different action that can be happening in the order has been fulfilled. Here, when you have the order in detail, this is a kind of a summary of the different steps.
Agent: As you can see, the payment that has been processed, as you can see, you can have the different... and payment authorization captured or [ORG-17] refound if the customer has defined this Here, it's automatically happening base d on the different stages Here, you have the delivery You have all the fragmented price s around the physical product, the shipping price, and so on You have also the delivery shipping and you have the fulfillment order As you can see here, the fulfillment of the orde r has been done from one specific location .
Agent: Based on the product that has been selected, the fulfillment can be done in multiple locations. And again, it's based on camera metrics.
Agent: On the product that I'm going to have, let's say I'm ordering 10 items, but you have two different providers.
Agent: As we saw from the customer screen, you can have five customers, five items on this location and five on this location.
Agent: You can aggregate that basically fulfilling the order of the customer, deciding to kind of like multiple fulfillment or priority one based on what's allocated.
EndUser: Destination,
Agent: So as you can see here, you have the free of time to be allocated. You have the fulfillment
EndUser: Order that is kind of provided. So this can be tracked based on the record that you have in ERP.
EndUser: Sorry, is there an actual pick seem to fulfill that order?
Agent: List?
Agent: Like what would the warehouse
EndUser: How would they view the product codes?
EndUser: Sorry?
EndUser: So when the order goes in and then it's going for fulfillment, what screen would the warehouse see to know, right, what am I putting in the box?
EndUser: And how would they record that?
Agent: Here, like literally, it's literally the screen that I was showing earlier. So basically everything here is that the product screen, the order summary is the recap of all the product here.
EndUser: And can they scan the barcode to mark that as that part is in the box?
Agent: Exactly. Here, the barcode is kind of like putting like, as you can see, it's an example here of the barcode.
Agent: You have the barcode for the full order, but you can have like a different barcode for every fulfillment if it has been split or like different kind of allocation as well. It really depends
EndUser: On how you want to. So when somebody orders 10 tips, there's up to 21 items per kit.
EndUser: So we would need to know that the warehouse are putting those 11. stuff I can say for that one kiss and doing that ten times .
EndUser: How would they record that?
Agent: The record that is that basically as soon as this kind of product, this scan is going to be allocated to a single item is 17 or is going to be divided by path.
Agent: It's really dependent on how the record is As I said, the product skew is exposed and is like a record that is an entity.
EndUser: Like in [GPE-8].
Agent: You can by a simulator.
EndUser: Have the barcode
Agent: As soon as it's in, it can scan any item and 10 of those and it's validated that it's posted because as soon as it's scanned it, the stage of the order is going to be added.
Agent: To be progressing
Agent: Here .
Agent: Are we saying this is something we quite commented to see with management integrations?
Agent: Are we saying that stored at level is all split out
EndUser: I guess the data the bottom whereas we're
Agent: I guess that depends on how we want stock to be stored in [ORG-1] because the [ORG-28] we can have a direct connection between SAP where it pulls up the individual items that I needed to make up that product or we sort of tweak the integration, say that it sort of stores the, I guess the full product that you guys are looking for as the quantity.
EndUser: Say it really depends on how we handle that between integration of what the data is in [GPE-9] and how we data within the [ORG-28].
Agent: Store the stock
EndUser: So definitely as <inaudible>, but the [ORG-28] entry is going out as parts.
Agent: The orders are coming in Yeah.
EndUser: And then they're bundled into a kit. So each bond is in a box. Yeah. And we need to be able to manage that at a granular level.
Agent: So that if there is an item missing, but the kit still goes, we can then generate a follow up take for it to go as soon as the stock is back in stock. Yes, it could be a definition
EndUser: Of your flow if you wanted to. As long as every item in a box has an independent report, as long as it's identified independently, it's looking for a mobile to track it.
EndUser: Yeah, because in my head, the warehouse, they get the picklist, pro <inaudible>. And that is going in that box, they scan it with the barcode, it goes in the box, the seal, but that's marked.
EndUser: So they might only send five <inaudible> out of 10
Agent: <inaudible> And that would order.
Agent: Still show then as half the order has gone and half the order is still scheduled.
Agent: Okay. So I would say this is part of the kind of aggregation when you have the order.
Agent: As you said, from a customer standpoint, if you hold 10, as you said, and they are able only to kind of fall it with five different items.
Agent: If they are not able to provide it, if it's a partial fulfilled order, what you can do is to inform the customer, as you said, partially.
Agent: The process that you have internally is that if you decide to send those five items, or if you're waiting to have the 10 to send it in a bulk if you wanted to, as long as you are able to identify those five items.
Agent: Items, even if it's a bulk or independent kind of record for each boxes that you're going to have it's going to b e how and where this information is going to be located.
Agent: If it's replicated in [ORG-1] and is automated, so we're going to have the information, depending the system that you use, you scan it one by one, or it's just automatically partially fulfilled into the system.
Agent: I don't know if it does make sense.
EndUser: I do know it's a last really, I suppose because we're quite complicated in terms of You know, each case is going into a vehicle, each vehicle has a different make and model and so that complicates things.
Agent: Isn't it?
EndUser: And then, well, our slumber customers have multiple sites, so we can't always fulfill the whole order because we're waiting for a confirmation of which side the vehicles are going to be on. So we need that flexibility
Agent: In how we... These split orders. These are the parking bill.
EndUser: We would split orders level.
Agent: At a <inaudible> level, yeah. at the <inaudible> fine.
EndUser: Okay,
Agent: So you might send five parts at one point and then,
EndUser: So I guess what?
Agent: Yeah, it needs to sort of tailor the logic so that it sells for some of that then rather than because I guess we've done it different ways of different been the integration will pass over the bundle and then split out the bit of a tier as it goes into your ERP.
EndUser: Clients. Sometimes it's sort of full
Agent: What we're looking at here though, we need sort of the order to be placed and that order to then split out into the individual stock items.
EndUser: Because we might need to,
Agent: Then we're managing fulfillment, it's creating a fulfillment for five of the items and a back order for the other three items and then that would then go through the [DATE-11] stock check that we would be handling within [ORG-1].
Agent: So, yeah, I think we'd want to handle that logic from order to fulfillment order in [ORG-1] rather than being part of the integration. But definitely possible.
EndUser: Okay, and then I suppose just thinking back to [PERSON-28]'s question earlier on is then when idea I would like is that the warehouse is going into the box when that's sealed and dispatched, how is that transaction done to take that item out of stock and how does that then integrate back to [PERSON-28] which is as the moment
Agent: Are We want there to be and this probably comes back into our other conversations about mapping out processes.
Agent: I think we need to really refine and understand what that business process looks like because We're not just talking about the [ORG-1] here, we're talking about your data architecture across systems.
Agent: So we need to understand the triggers, the criteria when information speaks from one system to another. It's all as possible to do.
Agent: It's just making sure that the definition is correct in terms of what's updated where, when you're speaking about when it comes back into [GPE-9] and fulfil what happens and at what point we stop to be drawn down.
EndUser: Need that We can change the we can reserve
Agent: State system in the [ORG-28] so before it's fully fulfilled.
Agent: We put into the revenue and the information that we have from [ORG-28] is not basically fulfilled so we can change different criteria between systems but as we've seen like certain clients, I mentioned sort of our different use cases here of our process are done.
Agent: This is always a point where we need to sort of dive into . what you guys need it to be doing and sort of how your processes work.
Agent: And then we can align systems and solutions to ensure that effectively that we're performing the right action in the right system because [ORG-19] and auto management here wants to be the front end, the order support, and the side where once it goes over to your IP, that's when you're sort of managing your fulfillment lifecycle, you're picking, packing, etc.
Agent: But if you need to handle things like cancellations, return, reshitments, those actions are driven from [ORG-1].
Agent: There's probably going to be some level of communication with your ERP because even though we get stopped later into [ORG-1], we're still going to have to handle and create maybe future fulfillment orders or [EVENT-1]'s or whatever it might be.
Agent: But yeah, all of these sort of different processes need to be discussed And I guess at this point, we're talking sort of how does our integration
EndUser: Need to wor k between those two products That's effectively sort of the key at this stage of the process .
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: Because we were in discussion with [PERSON-23] a while ago, which was another provider for inventory management.
EndUser: And when the discussion came, having different entities and SAMs, we've got [GPE-10], which is We've got provision which is sterling and then my safe drive which is [LOC-2].
Agent: Our
EndUser: They then have to actually create three different systems to link up to those three two
Agent: Were saying that we would
Agent: Make sure that our currencies and everything were still aligned.
Agent: Is that that is going to be a challenge later on or is that something that you can compete with?
EndUser: Something
Agent: I'm currently doing an unleashed integration with a client at the moment where they've got two entities.
Agent: So I've revolutions that has formed for [GPE-1] sigh with [ORG-31] the [GPE-13] and then we've got [LOC-2] and [GPE-15] and they've got two unleashed instances and sort of managing stock and integrations between them.
Agent: So yeah, I'm familiar with that. I'm going through that right now with another client.
Agent: But yeah, it's that, it's all, as we said [DATE-3] when we spoke, it's really down to making sure that we've understood and we've mapped things out correctly to start with.
Agent: Once that sort of definition comes in, we've scoped, we've understood processes.
Agent: When you get into the build, it's the case of sort of going through the projects, but the foundation is really important to really understand sort of how and where those differences come in.
Agent: They're all going to be things that come up within the project that we had an accounted for, but as long as the high-level process is understood, we can sort of manage those sort of nuances.
EndUser: But yeah, I think that's for me, it's always the key part to any project is that initial discovery.
EndUser: So now in my head I want to find some chicken and egg for the conversation, as you [DATE-3], the conversation we're having [DATE-1], the conversation we can actually
Speaker 9: [DATE-19] is the priority, the form look at something like this because we have to do this for the president, we have to do that laughing before those. I think I'll jump in on this one.
Speaker 9: Thanks for the presentation, [ORG-4].
Speaker 9: It was great that [PERSON-34] organized this and gave me a bit more insight into into where we are and the potential, but I think, unfortunately, I missed the call [DATE-3], but I had a fair idea from that call we had earlier.
Speaker 9: What needs to be done is the business itself needs to figure out what it wants to do and How an order is transferred from a customer regardless of where it comes from which customer that is and flows through the system To fulfillment to invoicing and everything else and it would have seemed that we need to address some of our own [ORG-28] processes and procedures eliminate ones that we don't want eliminate duplicates and everything else and figure out what we need is the best fit before we can tackle this self-service Opportunity that we've seen here [DATE-1] and I think that's the more pressing work Because it has a whole lot and block-down consequences for the business between interactions with [NORP-3] and everything else revenue recognition inventory control all those other
Agent: Things So I think until we get our house a little bit in order and figure out what we all want from the different departments, I think that needs to be done first before we can proceed with anything like this.
Agent: Yeah, I think in terms of what you mentioned there, [PERSON-7], we again, sort of, go from [ORG-23] here.
Agent: What we spoke about [DATE-3] was looking at mapping out and supporting you with sort of mapping out what those business processes look like. In terms of SAP integration, [GPE-9], sort of how we handle orders.
Agent: I'm sure we'll probably come into that conversation as well.
Agent: I know that we're looking at, trying to rely on with ensuring that there's automation and efficiencies between the different business units, because at the moment, as we understand it, it's quite a siloed.
Agent: And I think, Yeah, there's different what we spoke about was looking at sort of mapping out those processes as a whole and then looking at road mapping in sort of different different solutions.
Agent: Some we want to get quick wins in. We want to make sure that you can start to get value from certain areas salesforce that are that you're not currently.
Agent: But potentially when you look at things like an SAP integration.
Agent: Maybe not big to be, which is what [ORG-4] was initially could look at, but order management here and sort of how a fulfillment handled that naturally come into those conversations, sort of around integration, around managing orders, around fulfillment, if that's a process that we're looking to bring in with SAP earlier in the project, then order management might be sort of where we lead, but yeah, I don't think.
Agent: We've been at the stage of discussing that yet, as we said [DATE-3], I think it's going to be mapping out what exactly what you guys
Speaker 9: Need from a business process perspective first. I completely agree.
Agent: And that's something we have to fix internally.
Agent: And we find also, also, if you're kind of like thinking about the processes, as much as we talked with [PERSON-28] about physical product, and this is what we focus on [DATE-1], [PERSON-7] touched on the SaaS product, and because of the time is already 11, we didn't have time to talk about the SaaS product, which was key for you.
Agent: Things we talked about now are in [GPE-11] for into like three different products, and kind of how this is also orchestrated.
Agent: So the idea is that maybe when you're mapping those two different needs, it's kind of like having a view on both physical and...
Speaker 9: Also SaaS product as well would be kind of like facilitating this kind of next step .
Speaker 9: I think when you talk SaaS, the both same side of the point, physical you know, empowers the SaaS element, the business itself is going through a transition where We will talk about less and less about hardware and cameras and things like that, but about the actual software and service that we provide, because the cameras and elements of hardware are just a device.
Agent: About physical and
Agent: Device that,
Speaker 9: They're a communication device. They take a snapshot. It's the data in our software, which is where we want to focus on and
Agent: Talk about and change the mindset internally and externally with our customers.
Agent: Yeah, and I think this is the piece and unfortunately we don't have time to talk about this kind of like a subscription type of product because it was the second part of the demo after the request
Speaker 9: But happy to have a follow up on that so you can have a view as well on how this can look like.
Speaker 9: Yeah, well thank you I think I think everybody's jumping off and got other appointments to go to but I want to say thank you for your presentation.
Speaker 10: I'll have some work internally first. Yeah, just to add to our conversation [DATE-3], I'm written up an email that you'll be receiving shortly on the sort of proposal and plan next steps and all that kind of thing.
Speaker 10: And the overall architecture where these pieces that we've seen [DATE-1] will come into that overall review and roadmap and architecture. I'm not saying we're going to do the full on workshop or anything like that.
Speaker 10: But yeah, you'll see from my email later
Agent: On what we're suggesting. Okay. Yeah, and [PERSON-7] just on that point just to [DATE-19]'s session was recorded, so we get your kind of feedback on the plans that.
Speaker 9: Wrap up [DATE-1].
Agent: You know, the team, [PERSON-23]'s the partner and herself's had to kind of move forward which have happened over [DATE-19] around, you know, what that future looks like, because ideally we need to get the basis, know, the basics set up correctly so that we can grow
Speaker 9: Based on the conversations
EndUser: You
Speaker 9: With you guys. So time, if you could have a look at that,
EndUser: In your own
Agent: That would be fantastic. So, yeah, thank you to me, yeah, it's just on the meeting invite, you'll see it below.
EndUser: I think. Yeah,
Agent: I've added you
Speaker 9: Would access it .
EndUser: To
Speaker 9: Okay. All right, folks. Thank you very much for your time.
Agent: Thanks
Speaker 8: Very much. Thanks. Have a great afternoon.
Speaker 9: Hi, kids.
Agent: Bye bye. Thanks all.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of explaining the features and capabilities of the product, but there are a few instances where they could have better articulated the value proposition of the company or product. Here are some examples:

1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep mentioned that the product would help the customer's business grow and become more scalable, but they did not provide specific examples or benefits of how this would happen.
2. When discussing the product's ability to optimize the customer's current sales force infrastructure, the sales rep could have provided specific examples or use cases to illustrate how this would translate into cost savings or increased efficiency for the customer.
3. The sales rep mentioned that the product would help the customer's business become more automated, but they did not explain how this would lead to improved customer experience or increased revenue.
4. The sales rep briefly mentioned that the product would help the customer's business become more future-proof, but they did not elaborate on what this meant or how it would benefit the customer in the long term.
5. The sales rep mentioned that the product would help the customer's business become more efficient, but they did not provide specific metrics or benchmarks to illustrate how much time or money the customer could save.

Overall, the sales rep could have done a better job of connecting the features and capabilities of the product to specific benefits and value propositions for the customer. By providing concrete examples and use cases, the sales rep could have helped the customer better understand how the product would solve their specific pain points and needs.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or who the correct person would be if they were not. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The speaker only mentions sending an email with a proposal and next steps, but the content of that email is not discussed or agreed upon in the call transcript.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They did mention the need to figure out their own business processes and procedures before proceeding with the self-service opportunity presented by the seller. However, they also showed interest in the product and its capabilities, particularly the integration with their existing systems and the potential for automation and efficiency. The customer agreed to a follow-up discussion to further explore the product's fit for their needs.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific use case for the product, particularly in terms of how it will be used in the customer's business processes. This is evident when the customer asks about how the stock movements are managed and recorded, and how the order fulfillment process works.
2. The sales rep could have also delved deeper into the customer's current systems and processes, particularly in terms of inventory management and order fulfillment. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's needs and how the seller's product could be integrated into those processes.
3. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's experience with similar products, including any pain points or challenges they have faced. This would have helped the sales rep tailor the demonstration to address those specific issues and show how the seller's product can provide value.
4. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's timeline and decision-making process. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's sense of urgency and what specific information or assurances they need in order to make a decision.
5. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's budget and resources for implementing a new system. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's constraints and how to position the seller's product in a way that is feasible and cost-effective for the customer.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. The customer expressed the need to first figure out their own business processes and procedures before proceeding with the self-service opportunity presented by the seller's product. This includes eliminating unnecessary processes, duplicates, and determining what they need as the best fit for their business.
2. The customer mentioned the need to get their house in order and figure out what they want from different departments before proceeding with the deal.
3. The customer also mentioned the need to tackle some block-down consequences for the business between interactions with external parties and revenue recognition, inventory control, and other related matters.

These concerns suggest that the customer is not yet ready to proceed with the deal until they have addressed their internal business processes and procedures. The seller should work with the customer to help them address these concerns and prepare for the implementation of the seller's product.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions were focused on understanding the customer's needs, pain points, and requirements. Here are some examples:

1. ""What we're going to focus on is that here kind of going through an opt-in experience... When we talk about delivering an experience to different audiences, this is how it works...""
2. ""So here this is [PERSON-15]. As you can see, we are going to kind of sparkle around this experience a lot of reminder that it's a co-branding experience...""
3. ""What we're going to do, just according to the time we're going to go through one journey to show you how you can order how the self-service experience looked like...""
4. ""And again, this is kind of been materialized to you agents to you direct customer, to you and direct customer to your resailors and so on...""
5. ""So we're going to try to cover about four different topics and the question that have raised across our conversation [DATE-2], a conversation that we had with [PERSON-7] [DATE-3], so it's kind of multiple journey...""

These questions helped the sales rep to understand the customer's needs and tailor the demo accordingly."
video_19784_167_6qr3y000000g5yvAAA,"Agent: Okay, and in the interest of time, I am also starting to share the screen, but first of all, let me give us all of you a background.
Agent: So I think with the [GPE-1], sir, we have been associated almost from last three [DATE-1]. It was such like that, that we had started off our discussion with [ORG-1] and loan collection system.
Agent: Okay, so for example, entire loan or is nation.
Agent: And how the servicing of loan application will happen that we had discussed, but on a ver y high level from the system feasibility check point of view Now, very recently the I think the overseas have already shared some workflows which the y wanted to check whether that kind of Workflow be built on since force or not .
Agent: Yeah. But that Workflow is very much related to the kind of loan originations system we will talk about. But at the same time, we will also deep little dive into loan collection part of it, servicing part of it.
Agent: There is only one caveat to our discussion or any Implementation which is done for any [ORG-2] bank or [ORG-3].
Agent: So, loan management is something which is always on the premise because of obviously [ORG-4] regulations and guidelines which you will have to do . But beside that, low-no-regnation and low-collections system accept low management system.
Agent: Low-no-regnation and collection can be built on sales force.
EndUser: Yes. Yeah, I think I will just correct you. I think the conversation that has happened with [ORG-5] is not on origination and management or even collection at this moment.
EndUser: So basically what we are looking at are two things here. One is what we are calling as the lead management system. Yeah, before I log in.
EndUser: Before our leaders logged into what we call as the origination system, it is to pass through a journey, right?
EndUser: So basically it is to drop into our system, we have to call out the customer, we have to collect documents, we have to do some other things and there might be three, four workflows, right?
EndUser: For example, we might get data using API or there might be manual input to the data. All those things is what we are calling as a... So, let's hold it till loan lease management.
EndUser: We don't want to, I think in our time, we are not in a position to look at loan origination or collection or loan management.
EndUser: The second part is what we are calling as, I don't know if you mean customer service or servicing. So, basically, when the customer, after the, after the, loan has been created or even a lead drops into our system.
EndUser: After that, a customer might call us anytime and we will have to go and resolve their queries looking at the data that is available on So, that is what we are calling as the customer support.
EndUser: Apart from that, there will be some caveat to it like the resency of data, the data, how do I get the data from my core system to the [PRODUCT-1] system, how do I integrate it to the dialogues, how do I integrate it to my other chat services, right?
EndUser: So, these are the four two that we want to look at. We can hold off [PRODUCT-2] collections for now. We may not even take those services from sales source.
EndUser: So, the other points, other parts, we would want to have a look. Go ahead.
Speaker 4: Thank you, [PERSON-1], for setting that context. So, [PERSON-2], there was this workflows that I had shared with you. So, the entire conversation is just going to be around that.
Speaker 4: So, that is what maybe if you could demonstrate what [ORG-6] had.
Agent: I already have that. And let me present you the Workflow as well. So, just give me [TIME-1], guys. I am presenting the Workflow also, which the verses are had shared.
Agent: So, I think this is the Workflow which we are talking about.
EndUser: Yes, this is a very high level workflow. We want to understand your capability or if you have something around this. So, this might change by the way.
Agent: This is
EndUser: The one. Small amount of conversion we want when we deep dive this work from my team. Okay, but anyway we are involved.
Agent: Okay. So anyway, so this can change of course because different financial instrument which you want to implement for example, personal loan, education loan, vehicle loan, invoice financing, bulky capital loan, whatever specific financial instrument you will talk about.
Agent: This entire [ORG-7] collection activity or [ORG-7] management activity will change according to that loan product. Now the point here is if you see this workflow, I mean, this is an internal Workflow with respect to credit settings .
Agent: Everybody already would be knowing it .
Agent: On a very high level, with respec t to any particular partner or let's say any channel , example, it could be website , could be any third party API , will be getting the details of the lea d into the system, okay ?
Agent: Basic detail .
Agent: Mean, which product they're interested in , are their personal identifiers , first name, last name, address span et c. And based on that, we have a CRM system where in all business [ORG-8] related information will be processed.
Agent: I mean, quantitative data engine would be there, where we would be checking some basic detail and on the basis of that basic detail, we would be telling whether this application or this loan request is duplicated or not.
Agent: Once this has happened, then probably of course, if it is about single applicant, mostly in the retail sector of the loan, you will have only primary applicant for example, personal loan, education loan, but at the same time, these could be clubbed with co-applicant details and all.
Agent: So, you will also have due dupes running on the basis of whether that application or the applicant itself is existing in the system or not.
Agent: Okay, so for example , [ORG-9] would be running on [PERSON-2], which is a customer and his application of personal loan, [MONEY-1], which he has applied in [DATE-2], and which has not been processed.
Agent: Post that, you will have your [ORG-10] scorecards and all would be running. And this could be one of the APIs which is hosted on your platform or it is, let's say, [ORG-11], or any other third party API.
Agent: Okay. Post that once that [GPE-2] core card has run, maybe some initial telephonic conversation, WhatsApp or email conversation would be happening in the system.
Agent: Beside that we collect a business detail and while we are collecting all these business detail, we can also ask for co-applicant details, signer details etc. these kind of things. Okay.
Agent: Post that once we have validated and here also maybe while we are collecting co-applicant data, we can run our basic do-do upon co-applicant as well, that this co-applicant is available as part of how many applications, something like that one internal database check on the do-do.
Agent: Post that we would have to proceed further with [ORG-13] collections and all. Nowadays, I mean it is video [ORG-13].
Agent: And all is already enabled So if you want to go over those kind of APIs those kind of APIs are possible in this .
Agent: So this is the high level Workflow which we are going to talk about and to support this workflow, I have configured the entire system in some four five processes.
Agent: So, for example, sourcing the application, okay?
Agent: Sourcing the application can happen from bulk CSV, can happen from some web to lead application form or any third party API. Then, due to check on application and customer level.
Agent: So, customer level due to, of course, you guys understand, application level due can also happen.
Agent: For example, if [ORG-17] has applied for personal loan [DATE-2] itself and his application has not been processed ahead and whenever he i s applying once again we can say that your one application is already there you try to wor k on that itself .
Agent: Then co-applicant. On co-applicant level also we have some processes to add a co-applicant on any existing application and also co-applicant level do-doop is there.
Agent: Okay, then as of now we have provided certain dummy APIs which will fetch credit score which is part of our bureau score fetching in our workflow. Okay, now this could be one third party API.
Agent: This could be already as an [ORG-2] you will have all those APIs available. Let's say on AWS or whatsoever. So we can integrate that.
Agent: Then for business detail, we would be creating tasks in the system for whosoever is the lead owner. They would be looking at one button and they can add business details etc.
Agent: Bank details similarly and then there could be possibility that there are certain. Custom scorecard, some business rule engine like [ORG-8] engine you had.
Agent: So those [ORG-8] engine you can configure very simple configuration with respect to pen card, age of the person, marital status of the person. These kind of some business details you might want to check.
Agent: And at last, you will also get some bank detail and all from the customer. So, this is the high level system which we have built. And of course, I mean, we have ticket process as well.
Agent: But only one thing, as soon as customer has input their loan details into your system. there will be multiple different kind of tickets which can be invoked from the customer side, multiple kind of query.
Agent: For example, if let's say in this person has not happened, you have reached out to them for processing fee and all or maybe he just want to know low-application status or you have redirected them to your website from there, from where they are uploading their documents or you have a mobile application and they have certain problems.
Agent: Running those functionality. Or some sort of discussion they want to do with respect to loan terms, condition, any transaction on your website is failing, any feedbacks, they want to give, any additional documents they want to give.
Agent: And tons of different other issues which a customer can get into, for those we would be looking at a simple support process, not like a collection. management system, local election system.
Agent: So this is the high level things which we are looking at. And also we had designed certain KPIs and all that while we would be showcasing system for your customer support team.
Agent: So on the C-set, on first contact resolution, on average handling time, your [ORG-17] feedbacks, loops, and all if you are sending to the customer on ticket resolution time. So these are different KPIs which I had planned for.
Agent: And of course these are assumed [ORG-13] . can let us know what KPI matters for your service team , customer support team and we design [ORG-17] I according to them only .
Agent: So, something like repeat contact rate, overall single query, average time to first response, customer feedback response rate, etc. How many customer support ticket has been escalated, etc.
Agent: So, overall this is the kind of flow which we are going to see now to start off.
Agent: I am just starting off with the lead insertion into the system and lead can be inserted by multiple ways like one I said it could be via API, it could be via bulk CSV.
Agent: So if you want to adopt a very simple CSV approach, I would say you would of course have a template but basically till you can provide like a click and name, email, phone, requested amount.
Agent: Purpose of loan which tells me that what is the product they are applying for personal loan education loan, vehicle loan, working capital invoice, financing etcetera, design tenures.
Agent: So similarly you can give me data in a bulk way inside CSV itself. And that's yes, we will get uploaded inside our system, and leads will get created.
Agent: Also, second Workflow could be I can integrate your web portal or web application form, something like this. So very simple, same web form we have created. These kind of web form can be integrated with your website.
Agent: We can create, let's suppose you have loan application coming from agents, etc, which are for party agents, we can create an agent porta l and give you that so that loan application starts [PERSON-3] in terms of as a lead into the system .
Agent: Ok. So, ah loan application once it has been sourced, now I am showcasing you certain system which we have developed and which we have talked according to your workflow.
Agent: Just allow me a second and I will open up one of the loan application.
Agent: So now I am on to a loan application and here you can see or I can create a loan application manually also into the system.
Agent: So I am just going over, I am saying I am going to create a new application with respect to personal loan just along me a second.
Agent: Okay, so this is the very basic detail I have provided. I have just told my contact details, I have just told how much money I need and the tenure I am looking for.
Agent: Now here you can see as soon as I inserted that detail, okay so you have mentioned additional borrowers etc., co-borrower etc., we are calling them as key parties, okay.
Agent: So these are different parties who are getting attached to one of the applicants. Now, initially application is in created state.
Agent: Now also you can what you can see as soon as loan application comes into the system, this loan application will get assigned to one of your salesperson. So right now, I am the user in the system.
Agent: So we have a sandbox and this sandbox user is [PERSON-2]. So it has been assigned to [PERSON-2]. This you can consider as any one of your initial agents or [ORG-17], business development officer.
Agent: Or any salesperson in the system, it will get assigned to those salesperson . here you can see according to whatever taskmaster we have configured . example, now this is a very good technique .
Agent: What we have given ?
Agent: With respect to personal loan, we have configured a task master at different stages. So, here you can see update employment detail. This is your business detail.
Agent: I mean if you are talking about personal loan, it could be the organization you work for. If you are talking about working capital loan, it is the organization who is taking the loan.
Agent: Update fix deposit, update existing loan details, existing obligation, add co-applicant detail, update income details, update bank account details, update credit cards etc. If you want to know overall exposure of the customer, then credit card details and all.
Agent: And application assessment task which gets generally created for any loan officer who is looking at the loan firsthand.
Agent: So, these kind of tasks will get created with a specific due date which your team would have to work on and the process is very simple.
Agent: I mean first of all I must showcase you one specific thing for example, just allow me [TIME-1].
Agent: And I am very quickly moving to something called as an admin and there we will showcase you some of the high level things which is not relevant to the entire lead management only but is relevant to assigning task etc.
Agent: So right now I have three products which are configured in the system orthogon education loan personal loan okay. With respect to personal loan product, you can see these are different, different team who comes on different, different stages.
Agent: Now we are just talking about lead management. We are not talking till this first stage.
Agent: Otherwise application assessment team is there who is doing the actual job of all those initial checks, whether business details are available, whether bank details are available, whether income employment, these kind of details are available.
Agent: Then there is pre-qualification team, then there is credit review team. These different team members will get allocated all these tasks depending upon whatever configuration I have kept in personal loan product itself.
Agent: Then also I have some rate cards etc. Then whatever documents I need for example at last you do [ORG-18] check as part of your lead management system.
Agent: So at [FAC-1], what are all different documents will get collected from the customer?
Agent: All of those documents are attached over loan-product itself. And also whatever Messaging for example, this is product message association.
Agent: For example, at a particular stage of the loan, If you want to send certain message to the customer via let's say this message could be WhatsApp, this could be email, this could be whatever.
Agent: So it simply says, hi customer name your application has been created successfully. So it this message will go over any communication channel. It is a configurable module. So all of your communication WhatsApp email will get sorted from here.
Agent: Okay, now I'm just coming. back.
Agent: Similarly, who will approve etc all those things are not needed but all of thos e are configuration on our system and similarly you have for personal loan you will have EM I calculator etc.
Agent: But the most important part is I have designed one process flow for ou r personal loan product and what does this process flow says?
Agent: Very simple . When this process flow very simply says on different stages in the loan applications. So, for example, these are the statuses.
Agent: What actions will be taken?
Agent: What would be the next actions?
Agent: And whether that actions would be kind of automated action, I mean, will be taken by system or it would be a manual action. All of those are configuration in our system.
Agent: At the same time, whatever task we have showcased you. So, for example, Just allow me to showcase you one of the tasks master .
Agent: Just give me [TIME-1].
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Okay, so here you can see on application created stage, you would have seen so many tasks, employment and income details, then obligation detail, existing loan, bank details, credit card details, fixed deposit details.
Agent: Now, all of these tasks gets created automatically depending upon that loan application has come for working capital loan or let's say personal loan or education loan or vehicle loan. Even document checking related tasks etc.
Agent: All of them will get created Accordingly, we have set the configuration in the system So all of these are not coded These are configuration in the system Now I'm just going back to our previous loan application And I will showcase you the workflow, which I was just mentioning .
Agent: So this was the loan application which we just created. Okay. These are some of the details and all. And here you can see these are all the tasks which has got created.
Agent: Now one by one as a salesperson and these tasks could be created one by one. These tasks could be created in single sort. What I would do. So for example, let's suppose I have to add a co-applicant.
Agent: I clicked a task and I need not to do anything.
Agent: So it is saying to me, hey, you have to add a co-applicant, so very simple. I will add let's say [PERSON-4] as a co-applicant who would be a borrower or co-borrower, sign-up, guarantor, etc, etc.
Agent: There could be multiple rules.
Agent: I mean if I want multiple let's suppose had this been a working capital loan and three directors are associated who are becoming borrower, one is becoming signer, one is becoming guarantor.
Agent: So, I am just adding another co-applicant just allow me a second, go borrower. and I will say save. So now I have added co-applicant details if I just go back okay.
Agent: In my key parties all of those three records will get created. So for example here you can see [ORG-17], [ORG-17], three COBOROORs have been created.
Agent: Similarly if I have to work on let's say update bank account of the customer. Now this is just a hypothetical example but again if I am this is for some who needs to work on this .
Agent: I do not do anything else. I just look at my task which has been created as part of late management journey. Okay.
Agent: If I have been assigned five different tasks on one application or fifty different tasks on let's say ten application, I just need to come on each of those tasks. One task register gets created for me.
Agent: I simply hit next action, next action on each and every task and task itself will understand what action is has to be taken depending upon whatever configuration we have done.
Agent: For example, now if bank account detail has to be filled, it has automatically shown me I need not to do and search for. So for example, I also have the option that I can simply go on the application.
Agent: I can find a specific section. For example, I have income details section, I have facility, I have application, collateral, etc. There are tons of different ways. I can add all these details.
Agent: If I want to add employment details and all, I can add from here as well. But the point is we are just working on our lead management module.
Agent: To simplify the lead management module, we have created a task master friend of frame. work on each and every stage and whenever I go on that particular specific stage for exampl e update other obligation of the customer.
Agent: For example, he might have certain other obligations. So, maybe he is supporting some of their relatives in their education etc. And that is kind of eating their 10,000 exposure [DATE-3].
Agent: So, their debt service coverage ratio is getting reduced. So, they can add their obligation had gross obligation, net obligation and frequency it could be [DATE-4] etc. And this task will get closed.
Agent: And their obligation details will get added to my low navigation itself. So, similarly I would have multiple tasks. I can complete all of those tasks as part of my lead management journey.
Agent: For example, I have One new income head, for example, let us say I do for, I should not say this, but let us say I am doing some freelancing, I am earning some unlike rupees, net income is again one like after TDS whatever that deduction you want to do.
Agent: And how are you paid bank account or cash depending on that. So I simply add this. I hit next and my task also gets completed. I come back.
Agent: So, this entire journey will go forward like this and at last I mean of course, we have workflows where we are fetching the [PERSON-5] APIs and all.
Agent: You will already have different actions as a salesperson available on the dashboard itself of the loan application where you can see flexible score. Now, possibilities are we would have to do some Integration here.
Agent: Right now, we are firing one dummy API so it will fetch a civil score and it will update civil score over here [PERSON-6] e just allow me a second I can simply check .
Agent: So, here you can see some dummy number will get updated between whatever 0 to 810 or if it is about let us say a business entity there would be instead of credit score there would be CMR score 0 to 9 which will get updated ok.
Agent: So, different action items can also be provided which will give pointers to our salesperson or who forever is managing the lead.
Agent: At the same time, once they have made sure, so according to our workflow, once they have made sure that everything works fine and I mean they are into the journey ahead of whatever we wanted to do.
Agent: So, for example, we have sourced the application.
Agent: Okay, do you do?
Agent: Do you do is very simple in [ORG-21], do you do is a standard practice ?
Agent: Which is again configuration, it can be changed by any admin person as well. So you can simply go and set up a dual-dupe on application on contact.
Agent: So we have as of now set up dual-dupe on our contact record and account record in the system. So account is like a business entity, contact is like a normal person.
Agent: So lead and contact we have set up duplicate rule. It is very simple. I mean you can simply choose object.
Agent: You can define your criteria and I mean due loop should be on the best of what particular fiel d So as of now we have set up due loop for late end contac t with some specific fields like pen number and their mobile phone, email usually all of the people will not have.
Agent: So, due to you can set on multiple fields it could be any criteria given by your team. Okay.
Agent: So, once we have sourced the application and due to has been done, then co-applicant would be like a simple task, fetch current score would be like action button, business detail, bank detail, again these are task and as soon as you hit that task you go for next action, okay.
Agent: It automatically will ask you at that particular stage what kind of information system is asking or we have configured on the product level.
Agent: Similarly for bank detail, now just to the flow, just allow me a second and here once you have collected all these additional business detail, co-applicant details etc. Then comes your K by C details and all.
Agent: So now like I showcased you that on product level, I have already configured that for personal loan, these are the documents which will be required.
Agent: So all of these documents, I mean document categories gets created automatically through the system.
Agent: And what do I mean by saying document categories and all?
Agent: If you receive any document from the customer, all of those documents, will be showcased here itself.
Agent: So for example, just allow me a second and I ca n just go over some other application or the same application somehow this document preview window is very small.
Agent: Ok, just give me [TIME-1]. I must showcase you this document feature, but somehow that preview window is small. So I will showcase you maybe in a different view.
EndUser: I hope I understand something great.
EndUser: What is a user supposed to do here?
EndUser: So, basically we are looking at a user who is the two good type of user. One is calling user and there is a sales user. No other user is involved in this entire process.
EndUser: So what is a user supposed to do here?
Agent: A data property, what is supposed to do is to go to documents and then what is supposed to do?
Agent: No, so on document they will simply go and once they click on this document from okay, Now this is your internal process that how do you ask the document from the customer?
EndUser: So what would happen?
Agent: There would be possibility that I can click a button and share them a link which goes to the customer in the email.
Agent: As soon as they click the link they would have all these folders available by different folders they can simply go over here and they can upload the document. Now.
Agent: Now your internal user would be able to see all of those documents while they are lookin g at those documents, they can, they would be able to approve or reject those documents . Okay, then we checked.
EndUser: And
EndUser: Yeah. Okay, yeah, so I have some questions here. I think we [TIME-2].
Agent: Are fast about
EndUser: So now I have a few questions.
EndUser: How are you?
EndUser: How are we going to drop?
EndUser: Say that the data diagram, okay?
Agent: If you look at
EndUser: Part of the diagram talks about data dropping from using API's into the system. If you look at the top, left-hand corner top, we say that partner API is data is getting dropped by a network system.
Agent: How is this process going to happen?
Agent: Very simple. So, let's suppose you have 10 partners who are giving you data. We do API Integration with all of those partner.
Agent: You will already have those API available, okay?
Agent: Or we can share one API work.
EndUser: To each of your partner which usually doesn't
Agent: What do you mean by [DATE-5] share by API?
Agent: Okay,
EndUser: Okay. So, so. Is it a platform which I'm going to take you to.
Agent: Make one API, what is it?
Agent: Yes, yes, yes. So you see here, I have applications getting created into the system. Now each of these applications are different, different application. One is personal loan, one is auto loan education loan.
Agent: So the point is, I will create one API that API will give to your partners. Those those partners will consume that API whenever they have to send the data to your system or to your sales team, basically.
EndUser: What do you mean by your database?
EndUser: It is the other way around, right?
EndUser: So basically, the partner is to
Agent: Drop this data into the salesforce system. Okay, so tell me one thing they were sees are when you have written this partner APIs, what do
EndUser: You mean by partner API?
EndUser: Partner API is a personal data.
Agent: Partner will give you the you have to say, I'm just deliberating what you said.
EndUser: So basically
Agent: Partner will give you the data, okay.
Agent: When partner is giving you the data, you have to give them one end point where they would say that, hey, this is the first name, this is the last name, this is the email, this is the requested amount tenure and interest rate, which is expected.
Agent: So I will build a framework in my system, which we call as API,
EndUser: And I will give that to your partners. Okay, what do you mean
Agent: By you will build is it the platform feature or is it some custom platform feature.
Agent: So as soon as you come on board with the platform and [DATE-6] itself for API gets created for each and every entity or object in the system. So for example, application is one object. Okay.
Agent: Now with respect to application, I will give four API to each of your partner one two create the application. want to edit or update the application, want to delete, want to delete the application.
EndUser: So these are standard feature of any [ORG-18]. Okay.
EndUser: Fine.
Agent: Next is how are they going to send the documents?
Agent: Okay. So for documents sending,
EndUser: Is your partner sharing the document or your There are two processes here, right?
EndUser: One is that the partner might connect, collect some document and give it to us. Second is the salesperson or the person in the agent certain might call up the estimates either to why need additional documents.
EndUser: Now let's hold off to the second process. I have more questions there, but if the partner wants to
Agent: Drop that documents to us, how will he drop the documents to us?
Agent: Okay, so partner. cannot drop the document to you until and a user interface to th e partner [ORG-21] e email you the document.
EndUser: Unless you provide
EndUser: Otherwise, partner have to just Why?
Agent: Hello?
Agent: Why?
Agent: There has to be [ORG-17], they have to drop in. So that's what I'm coming to.
Agent: So one way is that you provide some user interface to partner, where if he has submitted 111 loan applications to you in [DATE-7], he goes on that partner portal and he upload all the data.
Agent: Second point would be while we are releasing all the APIs for updating, creating or deleting application in our system, we also give them API to submit the document in the system.
Agent: So we call it file API or file transfer protocol API, FTP API.
Agent: They can simply consume our API and with respect to any low application ID or any customer ID, unique customer ID or unique low application ID, they can submit the document in our system.
EndUser: How will the documents
Agent: Get attached to this folder structure that you are showing here?
Agent: Very good question. So, when I said with respect to any customer ID or any loan application ID, they would be giving you the documents.
Agent: So, when I would be providing them the API, I would tell them that, hey, if this document is of this customer, so for example, they would be telling me. that [ORG-21] document they have Python catered on four level.
Agent: One is a hard card, one is pen card, one is application document itself. Okay and one is driving license. So, first I will give them API where they have to give me only two information.
Agent: First information for which application ID this is my in the my URL bar you can see either this is my unique application ID or this is my unique application ID.
Agent: So, I can decide whichever uniqueness inside my customer record or application record they have to pass me that hey this is either customer ID from your system or application ID from your system.
Agent: So how it would happen?
Agent: As soon as they fire or they consume my applicatio n creation API, they give me all the details of the customer and what he is requestin g for.
Agent: I forward them one application ID, okay, if application has been created in my system Now when they are giving me document, they will give me that application ID and the y will also tell me that with respect to that application ID whether they are [PERSON-7] me pen cut [ORG-26] avDIac e! or application document.
EndUser: Okay. My think, say agent calls up the person.
Agent: Second question, I Okay.
EndUser: So one is that you said the chair or link or something, but is it possible to chat with the person on a, on
Agent: A WhatsApp and it comes and gets the trust chair or something?
Agent: Absolutely. Absolutely. So, so let me showcase you that. Okay. Just allow me [TIME-1]. So just give me a second. I will open that.
Agent: So we can literally provide you a window wherein you can chat with the customer via WhatsApp or SMS or whatever other way. Just allow me a second. I will showcase you. You can do them email etc.
Agent: Everything from the same system.
Agent: Okay. So here you can see, you can consider, I mean, this is just a WhatsApp kind of system or you can consider you are talking to your customer, this kind of window has been integrated.
Agent: So there would be some phone number, etc. You can simply say hi to the customer. Customer will receive that message. When customer gives you a high back, on the same window, you will be talking to your customer. Okay.
EndUser: So what we do, it with your
Agent: We can either integrate SMS provider or we can integrate with your WhatsApp business API provider.
Agent: And not only this, I mean [DATE-8] if you have educated customer and customer is coming via some social channels, for example, they are coming from some social post of yours, okay.
Agent: Social media channels, [ORG-30] direct message and all they are doing, all of those can be integrated with [ORG-21].
EndUser: So basically if I chat here, can you share me or share me or
Agent: This as some document here.
Agent: So basically if they share the document here, will they get attached to the?
Agent: Yes. So as of now, we have not integrated that use case. We have just provided chatting related use case. You can view the document here itself.
Agent: But we can read the document and then maybe we can give you a window saying this document if you have already read where do you want to attach it to.
Agent: So, you will be saying to us that in this for this customer this is the application and I want to attach that particular document
EndUser: To the [PERSON-8] that would be one customization which we will have to do but that is not the ready feature which is available right now with us.
EndUser: Okay how do we connect this to a dialog solution like nullality or something.
Agent: Fine and
EndUser: So basically what we need to do is we need to call up say one is that I want to initiate a call from the [PRODUCT-1] to input the.
EndUser: Or even it might happen that a set of calls is directed from this
Agent: To anularity by the manager and it gets picked up by the agent who whoever is available two for that call. Okay, so that is very simple sir.
Agent: So for example, here you can see I have all of my leads in the system, okay. Now let's suppose this number could have been a good number.
Agent: So what do I mean by good number?
Agent: Let me just update it. Just allow me [TIME-1]. I will add 44334737. This is just my number. I'm just saving it. OK. Now let's suppose there are 10 leads which has come [DATE-8].
Agent: And your agents, your partners, your salespeople are working on this [PRODUCT-1]. I mean, not partners. Your salespeople are working. What they need to do, they just need to be attached to one of the phone numbers.
Agent: So here you can see I have [PERSON-9] etc. All the call logs and all miss calls, all the settings. So right now with my user, no phone number has been associated.
Agent: Otherwise, had it been associated with my number, maybe I can ask another team member of mine to login. And what they will do, they will simply log in via their user detail inside [ORG-21].
Agent: And once this is enabled, they will simply click on this button and call will start happening. If you can allow me [TIME-3], I will showcase
EndUser: You lying, but I will have to call one of my teammates.
EndUser: Is that okay?
EndUser: Yeah, but I did have another question.
EndUser: One is that, Yeah, there are in agent center how it works is that the manager Q that the calls for the policy right so basically it's not like you can pick and choose so yeah means you can pick and choose but generally what it happens is say there are 21 team members in the agent center who will be reaching out to the customer and then then.
EndUser: The cases, the 186 cases are allocated to this team. So, the calls get queued up to the agents and as and when the agent gets freed up, the next call gets into its data.
Agent: Yes, yes, so how what is the process here?
Agent: So very simple, see each and every [ORG-30] provider, for example, you name that your partner is [ORG-21], [ORG-21]. I mean. just has been acquired by [PERSON-10].
Agent: So each of your dialer team or dialer third party vendor, be it, know, larity, o [ORG-30], genesis, or any vendor for that matter, exotel, amu, these all have a predictive dialer. Now let's suppose what would happen.
Agent: [DATE-9], 113 customers have reached out. And my manager is saying that out of these 70 records, I'm choosing this, and this. And I'm in.. . and choosing initial 3 records.
Agent: And what I will do, I will assign it to somebody else. These are my cases which a manager will assign to one of the subordinate user. So, he will just assign these different lead or cases to another user.
Agent: Well, another user comes into the system. He goes only upon his leads and whatever cases he has been assigned, he can simply select all of those cases.
Agent: And here there would be one predictive dialer button Once he clicks that . First person call will go, one see hunks of the first person call, second person call automatically goes.
Agent: So that is a feature which is provided by your third party [ORG-30] vendor itself. They will simply provide us one API.
EndUser: We hope that API did one predictive [ORG-21] butter and that does its job in the background.
Agent: Now, you already have a, I believe it's for already as a. plug-in or something with [ORG-37], right?
Agent: Absolutely, absolutely. So, so you have a very reputed third party vendor. [ORG-37] has just been acquired by [PERSON-11]. [PERSON-11] already has a connector, [ORG-30] connector on [ORG-21] is also our partner.
EndUser: And [PERSON-13]: I mean, we have partnership with [PERSON-11].
EndUser: Okay. So, they have [GPE-3] connector. and how do I okay so now the second part to it is we will come back to this but how do we go and heat. My Code services multiple times.
EndUser: For example, I will first certificate [PRODUCT-3] if it is fine, then I will have to, there might be on this.
Agent: Some more curing
EndUser: And then I hit my next term API, which is a scotard API or something like this. So basically there might be three, four
Agent: Apis that I might have to hit in this journey.
Agent: So how does this work?
Agent: Okay, so see [ORG-21] is open API platform.
Agent: I mean, not only three, four APIs, even if you had 41 APIs, I mean, it is just about understanding the right For example, first API will get integrated to bring in the lead information in the system.
EndUser: Trigger point.
Agent: Okay, first API will be utilized to bring in the lead information. Second API, as soon as lead has come into the system, your salesperson will see this phone number button.
Agent: And as soon as they click this button, I mean this phone number field, second API will hit off [ORG-37] server. And my call logs and the call logs etc. will start coming.
Agent: My call will go once call is hung up, [ORG-37] will again hit my system, call log will come into the system. Then there would come a point when you have to the customer
EndUser: And you are fetching [ORG-26]. So on different stages we hit differen t different API . Okay.
EndUser: So there is no problem there, there is no restriction, there is no it was so what happens in that case means I have to expose the API to you to say it's source and says source you will customize the hitting to the API is it something like this or how does it work.
Agent: No all of API team will build the only API which we ask from your team is if you have designed certain backend API which you want us to leverage.
Agent: For example, I will just showcase you one of the workflows, just allow me a second and I'm just showcasing you. Here you must see how many
EndUser: Apis are there. No, so basically if you have to hit my system, then I would have to give you a API to hit my system.
EndUser: Otherwise, how we do here?
EndUser: What can
Agent: We do?
Agent: No, no, of course. So I will of
EndUser: Course have to ask you.
EndUser: I will have to give you an endpoint, right?
EndUser: And say that, OK, this is a sequence.
Agent: What is that?
Agent: It will have to hit me. Yes, yes, yes. You will have to give me the endpoint.
EndUser: Yeah. Also, basically, you can, OK, so you will, your team will hit that [ORG-37]. But I will have to, for every API basically, there is going to be some more work
Agent: That you have to do. Yes, yes.
EndUser: Ok.
Agent: And I mean, so your requirement is very straightforward. You are just looking for lead management. But believe me, even if there would have been 17, APIs, till this person in part, we could have handled it.
EndUser: Ok. You have the Fethon Street app.
EndUser: Is it handy for you to solve your?
Agent: Oh, we have [ORG-34] app we have available. So for example, if I can simply showcase you, just give me [TIME-1]. And I'm showcasing you.
EndUser: Yeah, as you said, can you tell me give me a tentative timeline on how long does it take for you to build this entire system that we just spoke about?
Agent: So, sir, if I just considered lead management and considering only three for APIs.
EndUser: And that's not good with reverse 5.376214163079647 APIs.
Agent: 7 8 API, had it been [QUANTITY-1] API, I could have told you [DATE-10]. [TIME-4] API, you can increase [DATE-11] and it would be [DATE-13] would be the 10 and 9.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: So right now, sir, I'm focusing you, I mean, you can call it big planner, field visit, free town street, anything. So, for example, let's suppose one of your agent is opening this.
Agent: Now, depending upon how do you segregate your agents into different demography, they will be having certain highlights on the map. So, this agent is working in two specific area, two routes have been basically assigned to them.
Agent: And here, first of all, they would be able to see how many total prospect or total loan application they might be working, how many existing customer they have been able to sell any cross-sell or upsell, how many new to business customer they have brought.
Agent: How many loan application have got forwarded to some other bank?
Agent: Take over kind of cases are there. So these are just highlight. These are just KPI. We can change it, not a problem. But the point is, as soon as you come on [DATE-8]'s task.
Agent: So for example, right now for [DATE-8], I don't think I have any task. Just give me [TIME-1].
Agent: Okay, just give me [TIME-1]. For fleet on a street, I'm just opening one another screen.
Agent: Okay, so the point is I have loads of demo org, okay, different solutions are kept into different demo orgs. just allow me a second.
Agent: So, for example, I mean this agent has been assigned more areas.
Agent: So here you can see, sir, I mean the point is, sir, on [DATE-17] basis if you are assigning certain tasks some agent has to do certain visits in a specific area, those tasks could be assigned to all these agents on [DATE-17] basis.
Agent: They simply do start day and day as soon as they do the start date, we also start capturing their latitude and longitude from where they have started.
Agent: Once they have done [DATE-17] from there on we start checking their latitude longitude and from there on here you will see that two visits I have planned [DATE-8] for myself.
Agent: Now visits can be given by the manager, visits can be created by the sales agent also. Now you can see I have to go to this customer or whichever customer. For example, I will just say start my visit.
Agent: And from here, I mean whatever is my current location, I mean this customer location this is taking from the database is into new [GPE-4].
Agent: So, I have to travel from [GPE-5] to new [GPE-4], but this would not be the normal case.
Agent: So, as soon as I reach customer location, let us say for some document collection etcetera these kind of activity, I do the check in.
Agent: While I am doing the check-in, then in their itself you can see I have something called as documents. There I will load the document etc from the customer on the customer record itself.
Agent: Otherwise what I will do, I will simply do a checkout and while I do the checkout, very simple, it from wherever I have started my day till checkout place, if it is [QUANTITY-2], [QUANTITY-3] will get added mile into my day visit plan.
Agent: Then I go to second customer. So I did the checkout, just a check in and checkout I did, just allow me [TIME-1] . And once I have done the checkout, I can move back to my second visit.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And from this place to my second customer location, all of those again distance calculation will have the happening till he completes 4 visit in [DATE-13] or it is in the evening we give him a forced checkout.
Agent: So, in this way, he will complete all of his field related activities and they can log in activities, they can log a call in the system.
Agent: I mean, they can create a new application, they can create a new ticket etc. These kind of processes will run. Okay. Just give me [TIME-1].
Agent: So all these past visits and all you can see documents, you can see, okay, here I was showcasing you. I mean, you can upload a document, delete, reject a document, etc, etc.
Agent: So all those things you would be able to do from here itself, just allow me [TIME-1].
Agent: I'm just uploading a random document. So here you can see now. I have this document which was uploaded, I can see that itself.
EndUser: Document here
Agent: You can accept this document and or you can reject this document.
Agent: So, all of those automation you can set that once I accept that document what happens, once I reject the document what happens, And once you have done all of your activity with respect to this customer while you were on the fleet, you can go back to your previous record and you can start new customer.
EndUser: Visits for the second
EndUser: And Rajith, how does the data input happen?
Agent: Where do you input the data?
Agent: So, sir here itself, let us suppose this is one of my customer. Now, I want to log in activity over here. I did something I asked the customer something and I need to load down few things.
Agent: What action has to be taken?
Agent: What is the current status?
Agent: Any follow-up date?
Agent: Any specific type of activity I did?
Agent: Okay. So all of those things you can log in the same screen, so let's suppose you reached that location customer was not available, you give a customer a call, okay.
Agent: And when you are in the field your [ORG-30] and all your annularity and all will not work. So, you can manually also log a call into the system.
Agent: If you have given a call from your mobile application, you can create a new ticket for the customer. For example, let us suppose customer has some grievance, you went to the customer place.
Agent: So, you can log a new ticket, you can provide subject name, case origin, subject description, internal comment. etc. So these or tons of other activities are whatever you want to do.
EndUser: Kind of activity
Agent: So first point they will see, whatever we are focusing you is configurable, is codable in the system which means whatever we are focusing you will not be something which we are sipping to you.
Agent: It will be completely dependent upon you.
Agent: What do you want?
EndUser: You can literally tell us, hey I want this, I don't want this. On this, I want this added feature. Okay and so Ajit one more thing this is miss on the field this person is going
Agent: To have his mobile application, right?
Agent: It is not a extra application there. Absolutely, sir.
Agent: You are very right So, for mobile application also, had I had the tablet view, I could have showcased you or I can forward you maybe later time the design of mobile also.
EndUser: In saying that.
Agent: The point is, sir, this is completely reflectable in mobile application.
EndUser: What I said with respect to mobile application, your [ORG-30] will not work. Your computed telephony integration. This will not work .
Agent: Okay, so then how do this person call this person can into a call and will it go at place from the?
Agent: So, sorry, this is a [ORG-30] problem. I mean, this is a telecommunication regulation problem which will not allow to record any call on mobile applications.
Agent: Nowadays earlier there had to be multiple different vendors or mobile application which will allow you to have the Recorded all saved inside mobile.
Agent: But [ORG-33] has mandated it very clearly that on mobile application no call recordings and all is allowed.
Agent: So, it is just that it is a deficiency of your [ORG-30] vendors regulated by government that [ORG-30] will never work on mobile application which means if they have to call the customer, they have to do the dial from their normal mobile dial pad .
Agent: They can still click that button, but
EndUser: That button is now not the click to call , I was showcasing from here, where I said to you, I will simply click here . no, no, see, basically what I'm saying is, say ,
Agent: There basically, called, even if I call my from my SIM card, right?
EndUser: Is a number of these customers. So there has to be a button which is
Agent: Or I don't even record that call. That will happen. So I will just make this phone number as [ORG-41]. As soon as you tap this hyperlink, it will call from your phone number.
EndUser: Ok. That will happen, sir. Standard functionality is there.
Agent: Okay, but you are saying
EndUser: This from the mobile application the [ORG-37] will not happen.
Speaker 5: Okay, what Okay, that's good.
EndUser: Is your take on this?
Speaker 5: So basically what is.
EndUser: Yeah, I think what I understand is that Recording cannot happen.
Agent: When the call is done from the mobile phone mobile application. Yes, and this is not a sales force limitation, sir.
Agent: You can go to any [ORG-30] vendor, you go to [ORG-33], [ORG-30], [ORG-40], you go to [NORP-1], [PERSON-17], [ORG-45], any third party vendor.
Agent: Nobody can give you [ORG-41], any third party vendor you go, nobody will give you call Recording because it is not at par with our regulation of
Speaker 5: Telecommunication department, sir.
EndUser: Try and it would set a military thing Okay.
Agent: Down. Okay. Fine. No, so I did this.
EndUser: I think I have a question for you. Yes. Now, if I use a mobile application, I mean, yes, call, correct.
EndUser: Because the mobile application is linked with things called after the call, instead of failing the call on the mobile application, can just these calls not go
Agent: Towards the other end and get Recorded on here in form of a ticket. Okay, so this is a very good point, [PRODUCT-4], but let me tell you.
Agent: If you go via crude way what I will have to do, I will have to first build a AWS server.
Agent: Now on that AWS server, okay, first of all, I will have to set up a file storage inside mobile application.
Agent: In that case, what I will have to do, I will have to mandate that all of my fleet agent will have this kind of mobile application.
Agent: In that mobile application, whenever I get by that mobile application, I will have to disable the call Recording related foundation.
Agent: So, nowadays, [ORG-43] and [ORG-40], government has clearly mandated that from a developer point of view, disability of Recording has to happen, which means each and every time you try to record a call.
Agent: A [ORG-44] goes to your recipient sayin g Hey, this person wants to record the call.
Agent: Do you approve it?
Agent: Once he approves, then only you can record this call.
Agent: Okay?
Agent: Once, and even if your client has approved that request, as soon as you start Recording that call, once your client has approved that request,
EndUser: Now that call record will go into the file storage of your mobile application or your tab application. from that why the personal false knowledge I'm disrupting you here, this is a personal
Agent: False right, are these ads so, this is also application for personal false like ours?
EndUser: Absolutely,
Agent: Absolutely yes, [PERSON-17].
Agent: So, so, shortening the point, there is no solution, there is no solution in the market to record the calls on mobile.
Agent: No matter what you do, we have seen loads of use cases like this and
Speaker 6: Even if you try it is out of regulation you should not do it.
EndUser: To do it,
Speaker 6: I think this is contrary, this needs to be done as per the [ORG-40].
EndUser: If you are making any calls to the customers that the Recording needs to be kept right with you, we need to store these recordings.
Agent: No, no, okay.
Agent: Okay, so you store all the calls, that may be a regulation, but at the same point, like you utilize the words of contrary, I would simply dictate same words saying, it is contrary that government has mandated that on mobile phone in [GPE-6], no call will be recorded.
EndUser: You cannot record the call.
EndUser: Okay, so basically
EndUser: What we're saying is, I'm not going to call you.
Speaker 6: Any pieces is correct, there are you.
EndUser: No. Yeah, sorry.
EndUser: No, so is it, is it you are saying if the call is made from or thing.
Agent: A desktop application
EndUser: So, there or a or a or a or a color from. something desktop, open agent center, then it is getting like a nullality from recorded.
Agent: Is this what you are saying?
Agent: Yes, very good point sir. If you are initiating call from your [PRODUCT-1] and [PRODUCT-1], you have opened in the desktop, then all the calls will be recorded.
Agent: If you are initiating call from the same [PRODUCT-1], but now the [PRODUCT-1] is being opened inside mobile application, it will act like a normal call.
Agent: It will not act like a bridge call which is happening from [ORG-21] or [PERSON-13] .
Agent: Okay. I also have a very good point but I would be going into the technicality server.
Agent: So what does the [ORG-30] provider do?
Agent: So they utilize something called as a [ORG-44] technology. [ORG-43] is web real-time communication technology. The [ORG-44] technology only works in the browser. Very simple point. they do not work on the mobile application.
Agent: So, this is the baseline point.
EndUser: This is basically is there a we have already seen feature already.
Agent: Available for nullality with you?
Agent: Absolutely, we have it.
EndUser: Is it a,
Agent: What is it?
Agent: Is it a plugin available or something?
Agent: Yeah, it is a plugin. It is a plugin available.
EndUser: Okay. I think we didn't even touch on the customer support part.
Agent: Customer support is super simple, sir. I think I can focus you right away just along in a second.
EndUser: But then I clean it.
EndUser: No, I'm pretty sure. OK. Yeah, pretty sure you're saying something.
Agent: Yes.
EndUser: So they were. OK.
Agent: Yes, just go ahead. So, the bursi said now I am showcasing you some bits and pieces of customer support as well.
Agent: So, for example, as soon as I have logged in over here, you can see I have service agent dashboard. So, initially it will showcase you high level dashboard etc.
Agent: Then we will go into the decaying of customer support as well.
Agent: So, what would happen?
Agent: I mean, all of the [ORG-41] for example, how many cases has been received [DATE-8], how many cases by different sources.
Agent: So, for example, from email, from phone and if you have I mean social media and all from where your ORM team your online reputation management team is bringing in certain cases etcetera then those can also be integrated I mean insta, facebook, Twitter etcetera all of those fall and put customer success only or customer support only.
Agent: Then what is your first response time?
Agent: So I mean, maybe you can consider [TIME-5] is your first response time. This would be as minimum as possible.
Agent: What is your ticket to resume some rate?
Agent: So I mean, if 99 tickets or queries are coming from the customer, how many you are able to solve?
Agent: How many you have to drop?
Agent: Because you don't have people processes to resolve those queries.
Agent: What is your average handling time?
Agent: [ORG-44] said, OK. So, Cset score and all until and unless you do survey, it does not get calculated. So, for survey if you have some basic framework ready, then we can give you Cset scores etc.
Agent: Then, copy of call, abandonment rate.
Agent: So, if cases are coming from different calls or [ORG-30], what is the abandonment rate etcetera?
Agent: This should be as minimum as possible. Quality of service, number of tickets handled in [DATE-17], etcetera. So, these are just high level dashboard you can consider. Similarly, service manager. So, this is service agent dashboard.
Agent: Then you will have service manager. So, service manager will have similar KPIs, but you can consider that they would be working on our entire team level. So, they would be managing let's say four, five different agents.
Agent: So, dashboard you can get created as many as you want. You can also subscribe to these dashboard or you can download actually these dashboard.
Agent: So, all of those dashboard in the [FAC-2] or whatever way you want to download, you can download Also while I am showcasing a dashboard case by different sources or ticket by different sources, you can go into the detailing of this dashboard.
Agent: So, this dashboard has been prepared because I have an underlying report which gives me all the tickets by all the sources.
Agent: So, for example, from email I have these many cases from some other case origin, I mean that could be WhatsApp or something else. I would have some other.
Agent: So this is our high level report and here you can see so you can add your charts etc whatever you want .
Agent: So chart and all you can create from email phone instead whatever charts you want to choose you can take that is not a problem . of these are configurable things .
Agent: Also, you can subscribe to this report saying this report I should be able to receive on [DATE-17] basis, [DATE-17] basis, [DATE-18] of a particular time, only me or some other person as well.
Agent: Okay, what is the condition?
Agent: So, the point is, if let's suppose there are certain tickets, for example, a supervisor or a manager wants to know, all the cases which has been created [DATE-8], but first response has not gone.
Agent: I want to penalize those kind of agents. So, wherever state change has not happened, for that particular kind of cases he wants a report.
Agent: So, you can also add a condition that hey, while you send me this report [DATE-17], you know, automated fashion on every [DATE-17] Make sure that I only receive those kind of reports where I have these conditions.
Agent: And then, and also send this report to the director of whatever collection or customer support or VP of customer support something like that. So you can subscribe to all those reports and dashboard.
Agent: So this is about some of the KPIs on your customer support level, I mean agent level and manager level. Now coming to actual cases. So cases can be brought into the system.
Agent: From multiple different sources cases can be brought from your chat board, cases can be brought maybe you have something like query at the rate credits as in .com something like that or email you have the least or you have given certain DID number.
Agent: From where customer are calling. So, what would happen in case of DID number, this window will pop up, this phone window will pop up.
Agent: As soon as phone call will come, this will ring and that agent will have to pick up. So, that will happen with respect to case when it is coming from call.
Agent: From email also it can come, you can create manually also, I mean new cases can be created in the system in a manual way, you can bulk upload the cases or tickets in the system, okay.
Agent: From social media handles these cases can come. So for example, here I would showcase you that from different social media how cases can come into the system. So here you can see just allow me a second.
Agent: So, these are different post will be done from [ORG-41], [ORG-41], etcetera. So, these are post related. There could be some comments and all from all these different things ok. And then you can have [ORG-41].
Agent: So, customer are reaching out to you on the [ORG-30] level ok. So, direct message are being done by the customer from your [ORG-44] social media profile ok.
Agent: Okay, so here you can see all the conversation which has happened via social media. I, this, that, so literally like you talk to WhatsApp with your colleagues or customer, those kind of things would be there.
Agent: Similarly, there could be instead of [ORG-41], I am just clicking on [ORG-47].
Agent: Now here I am clicking on one of the case, just allow me a second and you can also see all the post comments and all by different people. So if there was a post, there was a post.
Agent: And on that post, some customer has written certain comments. I did not like services of, let's say, credit session, because of some reason. I'm just bringing a hypothetical scenario.
Agent: Then you can also see all those post, et cetera, who has done.
Agent: All those things will create a case into the system, you would be able to see those cases directly on [ORG-41] though you need not to see but at the same time you can see you can reply from here itself, okay.
Agent: So I am just showcasing you another sort of cases. So there could be 10 different reasons why case will get related into the system So
Agent: I am just finding a very good case so that I can showcase you how you would be able to reply from here itself.
Agent: Here you can see if somebody has given you a tweet, this is the tweet coming from the customer, you can reply from here itself, reply to this tweet and automatically I mean. So the point being made so.
Agent: You talk about any channel. This channel could be anything. This channel could be social media. This channel could be ticket coming from email. This channel could be a dedicated customer portal which your team has created.
Agent: Or it could be an email address. It could be a phone call. So now, consider it could be any source, whatever you guys support. Now, one case has got created into the system.
Agent: Now, case will have its own stages.
Agent: For example, case can be merged with another case, it could be in review, it could be under investigation, it could be under processing, it could be on awaiting on customer, it could be waiting because of our document, it could be whatever, I mean, there could be 10 different stages on the case.
Agent: Similarly, you can do certain activities on the case. Also, for example, you can send the email, you can submit it for approval to another team etc etc.
Agent: You can change the owner so for example supervisor is looking a t the case he can assign it to somebody else okay. So all those things can be done in the system .
Agent: And whatever cases you have, I mean, of course, so for example, loan application status here, customer is asking.
Agent: So, you can look at their loan application, if loan application number has been mentioned and you can revert back to them. Case will have certain milestones and all running.
Agent: If this case has come from some chat transcript and all, then all those chat transcripts will be visible. For example, also what happens, you can deploy a chat board.
Agent: And that chatbot customer is saying, hey, chatbot is not solving my problem, I want to talk to a live agent. So, in that case, all the initial chat transcript will get associated with this case.
Agent: And whenever chat to agent handover process will be done, then one case will get created into the system. So, cases can come from anywhere. It's just that we should have a sound policy.
Agent: That if cases are coming from let us say social media it would be handled by this team, it would be assigned to this team, they will have these stages and in this way case will close.
Agent: Okay if cases are coming from email This is the team who would be handling all the cases with respect to email. They will have these many stages on this stage, this stage, this will be done.
EndUser: And anytime you can ask us, I mean, whatever communication channel has to be integrated, WhatsApp, SMS, those can be integrated in the system. Okay, fine. I think [PERSON-17], we need pretty much what the call.
EndUser: So it is pretty now. I am dropping off, I think we might need [TIME-6], [TIME-7] with you sometime to explain the enter customer support part.
EndUser: So basically, the head is the customer support, it is 0.0, I was doing it without [PERSON-17]. Okay, so I think this moment is fine. Again, my question is right. So basically you are saying about that is your estimate.
EndUser: And I would say that it will be an aggressive estimate that you are saying it to [DATE-21], probably [DATE-21] for lead management.
Agent: For customers that are about to setting up this, is this available out of the box or it will also take about you 8. So accept social listening part, which is [ORG-41], [ORG-41] and [ORG-30]. I'm in.
Agent: Book and all . Everything can be set up.
EndUser: Okay, first of
Agent: All, let me tell you, in your lead management, we had certain APIs. Here we don't have much API also. Okay. So, this system can be deployed in maximum [DATE-18] time.
Agent: What time it will take only social listening part where if you have to handle cases via social media platforms
EndUser: Like [ORG-41], [ORG-44], [ORG-41], [ORG-44], then only it will take time. Otherwise it will not take time hardly two [DATE-21]. Okay, fine. Let's do this.
EndUser: I will try to figure out some time with [PERSON-17] [DATE-17] so that we can just have some comfort
Speaker 4: Give some comfort to [PERSON-17] before we move at. I will need [TIME-8] [DATE-17] from you on this.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:
- ""So, what would happen if I click this hyperlink?"" (asked to understand the customer's expectation from the click-to-call feature)
- ""So, basically, what is your take on this?"" (asked to understand the customer's perspective on call recording from mobile applications)
- ""So, is it you are saying if the call is made from or through the desktop, open agent center, then it is getting recorded on nullality from recorded?"" (asked to clarify the customer's point about call recording)
- ""I think I can focus you right away just along in a second. But then I clean it."" (asked to ensure the customer's comfort with the customer support part)
- ""So, I am just finding a very good case so that I can showcase you how you would be able to reply from here itself."" (asked to demonstrate the system's capabilities)

These questions helped the sales rep understand the customer's needs, expectations, and concerns better, thereby enabling them to tailor their sales pitch and product demonstration accordingly.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","It is unclear if the customer feels that the seller's product meets their needs, as they do not explicitly express this sentiment during the call. The customer does express interest in certain features and functionalities of the seller's product, particularly the lead management system and the ability to integrate with various communication channels. However, they also have questions and concerns about the product, such as the process for document submission and the use of APIs. The customer also mentions the need to discuss the customer support aspect of the product in more detail. Therefore, it is not possible to determine based on this call whether the customer believes the product meets their needs.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current systems and processes for managing leads and customer support. This would have helped the sales rep better tailor their demonstration and explanations to the customer's specific needs and use cases.
2. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's desired workflows and processes for lead management and customer support. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's pain points and goals, and could have led to a more productive and focused conversation.
3. The sales rep could have spent more time discussing the customer's specific requirements for integrating with their existing systems, such as their CRM and communication channels. This would have helped the sales rep better understand the customer's technical needs and constraints, and could have led to a more informed discussion about the capabilities and limitations of the sales rep's product.
4. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep could have asked the customer for feedback on the demonstration and discussion, and could have used this feedback to identify any areas where they may need to provide additional information or clarification. This would have helped the sales rep ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the product and its capabilities, and could have helped build trust and confidence in the sales rep and their product.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question: ""How are we going to drop data from using API's into the system?""
   Engagement: The customer asked follow-up questions about the process and how it would work, indicating they were interested in understanding this aspect better.

2. Question: ""How does the data input happen?""
   Engagement: The customer asked about data input after the sales rep demonstrated the system, showing they were engaged and considering how they would use the system in their own work.

3. Question: ""Is it you are saying if the call is made from or thing. desktop, open agent center, then it is getting like a nullality from recorded?""
   Engagement: The customer asked for clarification and confirmation about the call recording feature, indicating they were paying attention and considering the implications of this functionality for their use case."
video_19785_167_6qr3y000000odthAAA,"Agent: I know that some, some couldn't make it, so we'll record so we can share this.
Agent: [PERSON-1], Noble, [PERSON-2], anyone else from [ORG-1]'s side joining [DATE-1] or no?
Agent: Are we good to jump in and get started?
Agent: I think we're good.
Agent: Awesome. Great. So again, guys, really appreciate all of your time. I know that I've got a chance to meet and have discussions with each one of you guys here throughout [DATE-2].
Agent: I know it's [DATE-3] for you. Wanted to make a couple of introductions just to, I'm not sure if everyone has met [PERSON-3] before. I think you guys are familiar with [PERSON-4].
Agent: But from a high level [DATE-1], what we wanted to do is align with you guys here. We're approaching the end of obviously the calendar and [ORG-2]'s [DATE-4].
Agent: Wanted to just talk through, you know, what's top of mind for you guys. We had talked about a couple of different projects on the marketing front.
Agent: Also wanted to, in previous conversations, was speaking with [PERSON-1] and Noble, potentially about how other auto dealer customers are leveraging the personalization aspect of marketing cloud.
Agent: And so, [PERSON-5], I wanted to walk you through some of the use cases and related to what help you guys strengthen and power some of your current investment that you have in [LOC-1] [DATE-1] with regards to conversions.
Agent: But starting off, I really just wanted to get an idea and understanding for where you guys are, what's top of mind. We want to make sure we're being the partners and supporting you guys with value.
Agent: And then we can take it from there as far as next steps go. So, again, this is a relatively loose agenda. I think [DATE-1] will be a combination of both.
Agent: Discussion, a little bit of discovery at RM, and then some Enablement to walk you guys through some of the use cases, you know, particularly with it, personalization can open up for you guys.
Agent: [PERSON-1], Noble, does this sound okay to you guys?
Agent: Anything else you were hoping to cover or get out of [DATE-1]'s call?
EndUser: No, it sounds perfect, thanks.
Agent: Yeah,
Agent: All right, awesome. So smaller team from the salesforce side of things, as you know, we normally like to bring the full bus. [DATE-5] we wanted to keep it to a cleaner team.
Agent: I'm [PERSON-6], obviously your [LOC-1] account executive based in [GPE-1]. I'm up in your neck of the woods quite often.
Agent: I always wind up seeming to miss you guys, but I'm a sales force [DATE-6] and our entire team specifically focused on the automotive and Manufacturing industry.
Agent: [PERSON-3], I will let you make your own intro. Yeah, thanks [PERSON-7]. [PERSON-1] and [WORK_OF_ART-1], great to see you again.
Agent: You guys obviously know who I am, but [PERSON-8], I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting at I am the account director aligned to [ORG-3] for [ORG-2] overall.
Agent: And so, [PERSON-7] partners with me on the marketing side, but then I can help with any other side of the business as well.
Agent: So, I've talked to [PERSON-1] and Noble a lot of times, but it's great to get to meet you [DATE-1], [PERSON-8], and I'll probably stay quiet, my statistic.
Agent: This call since this is [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-5] show [DATE-1] But if you ever need anything, I'm always her e
EndUser: As a point of contact to reach out to .
Agent: Perfect. Thank you. I believe you guys have met [PERSON-5].
Agent: It might have been a bit, but [PERSON-5], let you go and introduce yourselves. Hey everyone, [PERSON-1], I don't think you and I have probably [DATE-7].
EndUser: Chatted for a couple
Agent: And that was back when I mean. Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah, and you're probably helping me with some point of view framing just for automotive industry specific use cases. So I hope you're doing well.
Agent: Great to see you again. No, [PERSON-9], you and I have been on a couple calls [DATE-8]. Right, tells me you're a [ORG-4] fan. I'm a [ORG-5] fan, but also a [ORG-6] fan. So congratulations on the.
Agent: The [GPE-2]'s internment
Agent: Went against my Pacers. And then, when they... Oh, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, of course, of course. And then, when they... I'm not sure that we've been on calls before, but great to meet you.
Agent: I'm solution engineer here at [ORG-2], support [PERSON-7], all his accounts from a technical perspective. I've been at [ORG-2] for [DATE-9] now, so I appreciate everyone taking the time during a busy time of year.
Agent: Awesome. Thanks, [PERSON-5].
Agent: Yeah, there was something weird about seeing [PERSON-10] and company pop champagne bottles and goggles here in [DATE-10], but hey, I do like what the [ORG-7] was doing in the... into the [GPE-2]'s tournament at some additional levels of excitement.
Agent: So awesome. So with that, I know obviously you guys doing no-able.
Agent: [PERSON-1], [PERSON-13], do you want to just make a quick intro for yourself as well and just a quick overview on your role since I know you hadn't had a chance to align with [PERSON-3]?
EndUser: Sure, I'm the marketing manager for [ORG-3]. So I oversee all the marketing initiatives for all of the locations.
Agent: Awesome. Great, thanks. So I wanted to just start [DATE-1] and just try to keep this a little bit initially conversational for the time being right now.
Agent: Before we jump into slides and some of what we prepared on the personalization front.
Agent: [PERSON-15], we had talked about some additional side projects [DATE-8], potentially even utilizing SMS and mobile notifications for product recalls, things of that nature.
Agent: I've wanted to just pause because I know that obviously given some of the [GPE-3] locations have now been sold off from what I understand, I just wanted to sort of re-center our conversation and our understanding of where you guys are [DATE-1], what the landscape is from a growth perspective and then any additional projects or marketing initiative s that maybe we hadn't [ORG-8] d before we kind of dive i n specific to virtualization stuff .
EndUser: Yeah, let me kind of take that on first.
EndUser: So, um, with regard to the SMS shortcode that was approved by the aggregators and we are working on actually integrating that into [LOC-1] now and it will be available in [DATE-13] for guests to start enrolling in so we're actually doing.
EndUser: We will be doing the actual enrollment email and the strategy for that coming up in [DATE-15] with myself [PERSON-14] to get the team enrolled in that as I said before with the team here and as obviously that team knows At 68 is extremely easy.
EndUser: That's ourselves worst platform And we have a lot of things going on so we're absolutely interested in seeing the personalization items [DATE-1] And what you know potential it has for the future But as of right now the program is very over-subscribed, so we definitely wanted to take a look at it But yeah, we have a lot of ongoing initiatives in general.
EndUser: Noble and I don't know if you want to add any additional items or contacts up, but just as a general update.
Agent: No, I think that's fair. We're pretty close on all the SMS stuff. But yeah, our art to-do list for [GPE-4] is huge. And things that we're supposed to launch last
Agent: [DATE-10] haven't launched yet. For certain smaller areas. So yeah, we're just trying to get through it. Okay, got it. What would you say are some of the bigger like key priorities,
Agent: You know, for you guys, even if it's not necessarily marketing related, just so that we were aware of. You know, not necessarily competing priorities, but just kind of where things fall and you're in what you're working on.
Agent: Just also
Agent: The thing about a cardial issue is it's really depending on the store, you know, for five different businesses in one essentially because you've got the different departments.
Agent: Yeah, and they all have their different needs and different ways they interact with customers.
Agent: And so, you know, we're trying to get like our amenities operations integrated in for to do all that can be tracked and then that kind of thing.
Agent: We've service has been up and running for a while, and then [DATE-8] is going to be getting the rest of the stores, or [DATE-14] is going to be getting the rest of the stores live on the sales side.
Agent: Except, five pilot stores on it right now.
EndUser: We have
Agent: Is it four [PERSON-1]?
Agent: Four?
Agent: Yeah. Wait, no, it's five. No, it's five.
Agent: Yeah, I had it right.
Agent: You know, just getting things wrapped up, getting things rolled out. So, okay. Awesome. Well, that's great. Great just remind me, as far as how many location rooftops are to hear.
Agent: And now,
Agent: We at now with kind of, was there two in [GPE-3] that we're sold off?
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Yeah. Two. Okay.
Agent: And so how many we have total now under [ORG-1]?
Agent: So we've got 13 like, maybe other ships, and then there's some other smaller satellite locations like, Depending on the store, there might be a separate smaller rooftop for [ORG-9] For you know the vans and has a [ORG-10] used car lot so we don't always count those as separate dealerships But just 20 sort of proper rooftops and then probably like five or so smaller ones then like [ORG-13].
Agent: Okay, great. That's helpful info. And then just lastly on the SMS piece, great to hear that that's kind of moving forward.
Agent: I know I'd referred you guys, and I forget if it was List Engage or Off-Prem regards to the mobile partner to help
EndUser: You do the short code provisioning setup. Did you guys start
Agent: List Engage?
Agent: List Engage and it was [PERSON-14], and he's exceptional. I really love him. Awesome, great. I'm glad that's working out.
Agent: And so I just wanted to make sure from a timing standpoint, as we talked about, I know initially you know what you were like, hey, I think we finally found a use case for this and we were looking to maybe start this over [DATE-14], but knowing that, you know, obviously the mobile provisioning takes a little bit longer, things move a little slower.
Agent: I just want to make sure that you guys are
EndUser: On a good track with the M-Or if there's any help you need [DATE-15] in regards to that. No, we're in a really good place with them. Like I said, we're almost towards the tail end of it.
EndUser: I can't The thing that could slow down a little bit was some of the internal stuff on the policy side getting that approved.
Agent: Say enough good things about [PERSON-14].
Agent: Of things and otherwise we're in a really good place and he did an exceptional job with everything.
EndUser: But
Agent: I think we're good there. I'm glad to hear it. Give me a post that if we can help. I think right now and I'll send a follow up with this.
Agent: You guys have access to I think it's about 2,410 [ORG-15] messages for mobile SMS, but those get used up, you know relatively quickly I know initially you were planning to do sort of a small test kind of use case with that So we'll monitor that and as you guys get ready to sort of you know start launching campaigns Those can be added at any time so nothing that needs to take action immediately right now unless you guys are looking to launch something here in [DATE-13] I just want to make sure that you don't get dinged with over just on so So we can always take that offline or discuss whatever that's ready.
Agent: Cool. With that being said, I wanted to shift gears a little bit. We had talked a little bit about some personalization.
Agent: I've had some kind of siloed conversations initially with [PERSON-1] just a little bit, [WORK_OF_ART-1], saying there was interest.
Agent: I believe you guys had mentioned also that you had started to Maybe not necessarily experiment, but try to work with some additional vendors with regards to whether it was personalization or I couldn't remember who that was with if it was like an initial trial or proof of concepts.
Agent: And I was just kind of curious to see maybe [PERSON-1], you could fill us on where [ORG-1] is with regards to just any tools that you guys have explored to this point.
Agent: And the initial use cases that you guys were looking at with personalization. Thank you, I might be talking about it in a [ORG-14], [PERSON-1].
EndUser: Yes, so we're basically we're going to kind of keep that high level generalized for now.
EndUser: Yeah, we are looking at a potential data source provider and we're going to be doing a send actually in [DATE-20] based on some initial data with them.
EndUser: We actually had a discussion with their CEO [PERSON-15] and I [DATE-20] back and they did some updates based upon my feedback to them. And so we're going to be looking at potentially doing
Agent: Another pilot with them, but that's kind of where we're going to. I think we'll keep it for now at that level,
EndUser: Just until we know more
Agent: About what we're going to do with them. OK, got it.
Agent: And you said, what was the name of the vendor?
Agent: Was it Intercept?
Agent: Intercept. Correct. Intercept. Yeah, because initially we had reached out to our sales so
Agent: [PERSON-20] at the time for [LOC-1] that maybe [DATE-20] trying to find a vendor like this. So I think that's why it kind of ended up in their notes.
Agent: And [PERSON-1], what was the kind of initial use case that you landed on with them?
Agent: And what kind of data just for my own understanding?
EndUser: What sort of third-party additional data are they providing you all with?
Agent: Just would love to understand
EndUser: Some of the initial use cases that you all were thinking about with them?
EndUser: Yeah, it's about website tracking. So basically, it's a pixel on the website's track who is coming to the website. And then it provides, in theory, a lot of personalized data based on that person.
EndUser: The feedback that I gave them again, I'm just gonna keep high level for now and I'll have respect for them based on where we're at with them.
EndUser: The data that came back was somewhat questionable in some of the people that we ran through the system as actual use cases for all of their data. And so I provided that feedback to their team.
EndUser: So again, we had [PERSON-15] and I have that discussion with their CEO [DATE-31] and their technical team. And they are actually making updates to their software based on the feedback, which was great. [LOC-2] was great.
EndUser: And so we're going to again be doing another test with them to see if actually the feedback You know produces any tangible results that would be helpful for us But the use cases effectively to just have great more granular tracking and the website level
Agent: To be able to understand what that's are doing and then be able to put them in appropriate journeys And more specialized journeys based upon what they are doing at any given time. Okay, perfect.
Agent: That's that's all great to you That's great clarity for me.
Agent: And I think what we'll be talking about [DATE-1] will be some of those similar areas that you're maybe exploring with [FAC-1] now so we can just kind of have a conversation around maybe some of the tracking that they're doing and how does that compare to some of the tracking that's being done by personalization.
Agent: So I think some of the [ORG-14] we prepared [DATE-1] will be will be beneficial for that.
Agent: Really quickly, for [WORK_OF_ART-1], Tom, Lene, how much of an understanding, have you had any conversations around personalization in the past?
Agent: I don't believe you have, any sort of familiarity with the product.
EndUser: But just would love to understand if there's
Agent: Directly from marketing cloud, do you mean?
EndUser: Personalization within marketing known as [PRODUCT-1]: Cloud, the product Personalization. No, I haven't. I've done a very high-level generalization. Okay, Noble for [ORG-15].
Agent: Perfect. LaNae, similar
Agent: Similar, yeah. OK, not too familiar.
Agent: Yeah, OK, so I think if you all are OK with it, what I was thinking where we could spend the time [DATE-1] is we put together some slides around one, like helping you all understand some of the tracking that the solution does, but also trying to frame it in from the perspective of some of the different use cases that we could start to think about specific to your industry.
Agent: I think that'll be a good way to get some conversation going around some of the cases. capabilities.
Agent: And if it's something that you all are interested in exploring further based on what we cover off on [DATE-1], I think what would be great is, you know, on a futur e call, we come back to you and present really a personalized demonstration on a specifi c use case that we can kind of discuss [DATE-1] that would be most S o it's only a good use of time for [DATE-1] .
Agent: Relevant for you all.
Agent: Sure. Perfect. Cool.
Agent: Do you want to cover off on some of those initial slides and we'll get into some use cases?
Agent: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. All right. So real quick, before we jump into the use cases here, this is a little bit of a nice breaker. So bear with me. I'm going a little bit off the cuff here.
Agent: And [PERSON-5] always cringes a little bit when I decide to put this in. This is a slide and an exercise that I do depending on the audience. But I love working with [ORG-1]. I like [PERSON-20].
Agent: So real quick, you know, bear with me, we talked about marketing objectives.
Agent: Take a step back, right?
Agent: These two folks, you guys know who they are, right?
Agent: Just an exercise in personalization. Feel free to shout out [PERSON-1], [PERSON-13], Noble.
EndUser: Who are these guys and what do they have in common?
EndUser: [PERSON-20] and the Prince, or I'm sorry, the King now.
Agent: Aren't they both from [GPE-5]?
Agent: They are, correct.
Agent: Yes, so very good, right?
Agent: So at a high level glance, right, when we talk about basic level segmentation, when you're sending out segments, right, a lot of times you have a lookalike audiences, right?
Agent: You look at both of these two individuals, right?
Agent: On paper, both born in [DATE-20], right?
Agent: Both grew up in [GPE-5]. Both up two kids. Both been married twice, believe it or not. Obviously, they're both wealthy. Both spend [DATE-31] holidays in the [LOC-3]. They're both dog lovers.
Agent: And then to your point, they're both princes, right?
Agent: Prince of [GPE-5], Prince of darkness. So on paper, the whole point of this is other than it being a little cheeky, understanding that.
Agent: A lot of times on paper, when you're doing segmentation, a basic level one two many audiences, the way that you would interact with an individual might be very different if you had [PERSON-20] step into the dealer or interact with you guys than you would [PERSON-31]
Agent: It's kind of more of just a fun little exercise that sort of tees up as getting into the conversation and the value of one-to-one personalization, and that personas are fundamentally different.
Agent: But the approach [DATE-1] and what industry best dealers are doing right now is being able to know and track and understand, affinities, behaviors, you know, that goes beyond just you know, a rock and roll star versus, you know, a royal family.
Agent: But in regards to jus t model, make, you know, is it a soccer mom?
Agent: Is it an EV enthusiast?
Agent: Right?
Agent: Is it an executive Right?
Agent: So, just really being able to understand and relate to them on a personalized way . Alright, thanks for bearing with me on that. I just want to make sure sometimes people are paying attention. So.
Agent: When we talk about personalization, I'm going to get through this pretty quick, because you guys already start to see some of the value in this, given that you've already started to work with some other folks like [FAC-1] on this.
Agent: But bottom line is the experience of carbine [DATE-19] has become a key differentiator. And it's almost as important to the customer right now as the actual purchase themselves.
Agent: The customers want to be able to match the quality of the vehicle, especially with you guys and some of the name luxury brands. in terms of the car buying experience.
Agent: Of marketers say that customers, they expect [DATE-19] in this new generation of the [ORG-20], the generation why they expect companies to know and brands to understand them.
Agent: Two, it's highly competitive, right?
Agent: They all start their process online now before they even set foot in the dealer.
Agent: And so the question becomes, how can we then marry their digital experience with the onset experience that they receive when they set foot on the dealership?
Agent: And then lastly and most importantly, I'm sure you guys are not attuned to it, but every dollar is now held accountable in terms of cost per lead, in terms of, you know, add budgets, in terms of being able to prove conversions, you know, ROI and lifetime value for customers.
Agent: Right. So some of the just high level, you know, main themes that we see in terms of the dealership experience is being able to have a full connected relationship with your customer rather than just basic level segmentation.
Agent: That starts with collecting first party audience data. We all know that the third party cookie is crumbling.
Agent: And so having that data and being able to know and understand and be able to segment and enrich that data, and then be able to then leverage and activate that data becomes paramount, both in top of funnel acquisition, but also in terms of nurturing.
Agent: Things like, automated service reminders, product recall notifications like we talked about. You know, the list goes on and on, you know, throughout those touch points in the customer journey.
Agent: And so the value of being able to personalize at scale is really, you know, now almost become a necessity, you know, for when you're competing for these customers. I'm going to pause here.
Agent: Does this make sense in terms of just kind of like what we're trying to achieve and some of the value drivers that it produces in terms of, you know, return on ad spend.
Agent: Higher quality leads,
Agent: Um, the first party data.
Agent: Any questions on this?
Agent: Now seems pretty straightforward. Perfect. All right.
Agent: I'm going to get through this pretty quick because I think that it would probably be better spent, you know, getting into use cases here since you guys all seem, you know, pretty savvy to understand the value of personalization.
Agent: But really, it just comes throughout the customer lifecycle, like I mentioned, from top of funnel, unknown, you know, web browsing customers, to being able to start to engage them, to then be able to then get them into the funnel and pass them over to sales, ultimately, to get them to, you know, the point of a test drive, a purchase consideration, whether it be additional accessories, whether it be additional vehicles within them.
Agent: In the household and then ultimately becom e in a [ORG-1]'s brand fan that [ORG-20] y when they're in a buying cycle or decisioning process their question doesn't become what dealer should I go to Who am I gonna shop the best price with But it's the experience that I have in [ORG-1] They know me, they take care of m e and I'm immediately gonna go back to the m for all my automotive needs All right .
Agent: The tool that and the solution that we're talking about formally was branded interaction studio. As you guys know, [ORG-2] love to change Marketing Cloud product names. It feels like [DATE-31].
Agent: So interaction studio was rebranded to Marketing Cloud personalization [DATE-19], [DATE-19].
Agent: And really what this is, is this is a tool and a solution that sits within the Marketing Cloud platform that really bolts on to Marketing Cloud engagement and journey builder, which you guys have [DATE-1], which allows us to basically place that pixel on the website, like you mentioned, and start to track browsing behavior, intense for both anonymous and unknown web visitors, as well as being able to recognize.
Agent: Nice . and stitch together profiles and unified customer profiles for customers based on both purchase history as well as their behavioral insights as well. So we can then leverage that to be able to display dynamic content.
Agent: The exact eClass vehicle that [PERSON-7] was searching for online.
Agent: We can retarget him with an email, a [ORG-20] ad, or even when I come back to the website with dynamic [ORG-14] to show the particular vehicle rather than a static homepage to drive engagement and conversion.
Agent: From a high level, you know, we're seeing, you know, for you guys, this seems like a natural progression because you're seeing value out of marketing cloud, but even just being able to take it that step further of personalizing these for your customers, especially when you're dealing with, you know, a purchase that's a vehicle, right?
EndUser: That's more than maybe a cup of coffee or $[MONEY-1] widget. You know, the cost per lead and the value of a client becomes much, much more significant.
EndUser: What do you do when you actually when it gets to the website or anonymous gets
Agent: To the website and they have what we would call bebacks so in other words we're tracking how many times they come to the website over a period of time how does this software handle that It handles it.
Agent: There's a variety of different things that we can start to do with it.
Agent: So we'll track that individual as long as they don't clear their cookies, right?
Agent: We'll track that individual every session they have on the website. We'll talk about some of the levels of tracking that we do. So time spent.
Agent: Developing what we call an affinity profile that essentially helps us understand make model trim new versus used.
Agent: Where's that interest fly?
Agent: And then you can use those folks when they're anonymous in a variety of different ways so you can target them with different campaigns that we have out of the box, whether that's specific calls to action for them.
Agent: [PERSON-20] tank campaigns is another example.
Agent: So if they start to leave the website, but they're still anonymous We want to try to capture some piece of information about them before they leave We can start to essentially just provide a specified experience for anonymous folks, but it's got a lot of stability [PERSON-31]: What data can you provide to us about like the actual person themselves?
EndUser: So as an example, They provide like hobbies and political facilities since not that we're going to use all of that stuff.
Agent: It's like intersect.
EndUser: But like let's hone in on hobbies for a second. So like let's say, you know, this person's been visiting the website 19 times or whatever.
EndUser: And do you have a database that you tap into or that is available that would show like a profile for what this who this person is potentially?
Agent: So for that piece, no, like we won't provide that information in terms of data that we do provide back. It's generally like a locational information based on IP address to understand where they're located, things of that nature.
Agent: We're not going to be that third party data provider.
EndUser: What about opt-in?
EndUser: So like do you know if they're on the do not call list, like the national do not call list based upon their IP address or who you potentially think that you're resolving them to be?
Agent: We would not know that. We don't know who they specifically are until they provide us with a name or an email address. So think about a form completion, something like that.
Agent: Yeah, these are all good questions that I wanted to delineate between personalization. And because I'm not as familiar with [FAC-1], the personalization aspect, [PERSON-1], is going to help us to be able to track the behavioral characteristics.
Agent: So as [PERSON-5] mentioned.
Agent: If [PERSON-7] comes to [ORG-3] and as an anonymous web visitor based on my IP address, until I actually raise my hand by filling out a form with my email, I'm really just essentially kind of just an anonymous almost think of it like a unique anonymous identifier, like a number that's a social security number that gets assigned based on my IP address.
Agent: Anonymously though, you do have the ability to be able to track my browsing history, my time on site, you know, number of page views, which vehicles I'm looking at, and then ultimately the goal is to be able to take all that behavioral data to then lean in to provide a personalized experience to say, hey, here, go ahead, raise your hand, fill out this form.
Agent: And then the magic kind of happens where we can then turn the unknown browser into a known user and stitch together we have.
Agent: Any additional information
Agent: Now that can be information coming that's logged already in [ORG-2] or information that you have from other third parties.
Agent: However, being able to introduce third party data, while [ORG-2] is not a data provider, we have a lot of customers that utilize data from third party data providers like [ORG-31], like [ORG-20] and [GPE-6], like you know, several others that are even in the luxury auto space in [GPE-7] that have other independent lists, you know, regarding, you know, net worth individuals.
Agent: So we can certainly ingest that and we can talk about that as well because that is a use case that a lot of folks provide. But personalization is not a data provider.
Agent: It really just builds and rich profiles with the information, both the
Agent: Behavioral info that as well as purchase and influencing data that you have within [ORG-2].
EndUser: They have on the website
Agent: So show you
EndUser: Like some piece of the bank, [ORG-31]. tied into sales, of course. Yeah, OK. Right, so another, yeah, exactly. And it was like, another word you're just tracking kind of, not that it's not important.
EndUser: And obviously that would be very valuable. But it's tracking. [PERSON-1]'s come to the website. You don't know that it's [PERSON-1]. But I've come to the website multiple times and I've clicked on this vehicle and this vehicle and service.
EndUser: And I've done all these different things. So it's tracking like a composite of whatever that whoever this person is. We don't know who
Agent: They are. But it's tracking a composite to try to guess what their intent potentially is. Yeah, that's a good way to think about it. We've got some visuals to showcase.
Agent: Essentially, like the exact data points that we start to track
Agent: And what that profile starts to look like both in the anonymous and the known state. [PERSON-5], I think it might help, but if we maybe jump right into some of these use cases, a visual standpoint
Agent: I think that would help from to showcase what we're describing a little bit, to get a better understanding.
Agent: Is that where it will go?
Agent: Some good. Do you want me to drive slides or
Agent: Do you want to?
Agent: Yeah, go ahead. That's fine.
Agent: So we start with a fictitious customer, [PERSON-19], who comes to [ORG-3] for the first time. We can start to understand that [PERSON-19], based on his browsing behavior, is his first time here, based on his IP address.
Agent: This happens through a pixel in personalization that gets placed on [ORG-3] website. So as he continues to browse, we can start to build up this anonymous profile that we just talked about of [PERSON-19].
Agent: We don't know that he's [PERSON-31] just yet. He hasn't provided us any information.
Agent: But all we do know is kind of where he's navigating, where his intent lies, how much time he's spending on the website, which vehicles he's looking at, potentially articles that he's reviewing as well.
Agent: So [PERSON-7], just go ahead and click through, right?
Agent: So essentially what we're doing is any individual that comes to the site, whether they are anonymous or known, what we start to do is build out what we call an affinity profile.
Agent: So [PERSON-7], go ahead and click through here. I don't know why it's not showing up, but this is an example of that anonymous profile that we build up. This all sits within marketing clouds.
Agent: So if you think about your different studios that you have within marketing cloud, it's essentially just another studio that gets added onto your Marketing Cloud instance.
Agent: So we see some of those data points that we'll start to capture based on location and IP address So this individual is anonymous We don't know who they are . but they're from the [GPE-8], [GPE-9] area.
Agent: Now, over time, once that individual becomes known, and in our book, they become known once they fill out some sort of form, apply for financing, fill out a contact us form, things of that nature, we just continue to build on this profile.
Agent: Now, let's look at a zoomed in view of this, just to take a look at kind of the understanding that we start to build up of every individual. So, [PERSON-19], go ahead and click through.
Agent: And if we zoom in on specifically what we call our affinity profile, this is what gets built up about every individual that comes to the site.
Agent: And we break this down based on vehicles that they're viewing, how long they spend viewing specific vehicles. So we're keeping that time tracking element of it.
Agent: And then ultimately, right, like once they actually purchase or lease a vehicle, we break it down from that perspective as well. So it's all based on your inventory, the catalog that you have of the vehicles that you sell.
Agent: And we're breaking it down by based on different dimensions around those vehicles. So make, model.
Agent: New versus used, what type of vehicle is it?
Agent: Is it a specific trim that this individual is most interested in, whether it's more premium versus more entry-level options when it comes to trim level?
Agent: You could also think about just budgetary numbers, what price range is this individual starting to look at?
Agent: All of that can be captured. The way that we do that is one, the pixel itself tracks the views, the time spent, etc.
Agent: But what it also does is that it essentially just builds up a catalog of all the different vehicles that you have on your website.
Agent: And with that catalog, it builds up that understanding around the different dimensions of that vehicle.
Agent: So then when a visitor comes to the site and views different vehicles, we can trace that back to things like we're taking a look at here to help us understand what we call affinities and ultimately individual.
EndUser: [PERSON-19] or an anonymous What is he or she most interested in?
EndUser: We can you go as [ORG-19] [PRODUCT-2] [PRODUCT-3]. Is that just an, is
Agent: That like an example of like, you're not tracking it across all different websites. It's just that you're just showing that they can do whatever make it is. Is like, you know, you obviously sell like new and used cars.
EndUser: That correct?
EndUser: Yeah, right.
Agent: So They might not all be [ORG-19], right?
Agent: So if, if someone's like [PERSON-19] is on [ORG-31] and is also looking at used vehicles that aren't [ORG-19], right?
Agent: Like we can still pick up on that. Granted, you're right. Tell them like most of the vehicles probably are going to be [ORG-19]. We would see that reflected in someone's profile. file
EndUser: . We can have this set up across multiple sites if we'd like to. I was cross pixelization.
Agent: Just going to ask that is our
EndUser: So like for instance, like let's say in [GPE-10], we have [ORG-19] and [ORG-19] literally across two from each other. Let's say they shop at [ORG-19] over to [ORG-19].
Agent: Or they were shopping at [ORG-19] say, and then they go
EndUser: Would we be able to pick that up on this IP address?
EndUser: So they say that if they're shopping at multiple sites?
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: Based on based on What about service?
Agent: Service.
EndUser: I would have
Agent: A service profile. So like let's say they come in and they're not shopping for a car at all. They're doing service. And kind of tracking that.
Agent: Is that something that can be done as well?
Agent: Right. Yeah. So all of that will be tracked. And that part might not be, I mean, it can be built into this profile as well. We would just have another section of it that is.
Agent: Is this person more interested in buying a new vehicle, leasing a vehicle, or service?
Agent: For example, might be like the way
Agent: That we start to break it down.
Agent: But sort of at the end of this when you get a tracking ID turned into a person, right?
Agent: It happens based on someone filling out a web form. Filling out a web form or like, right, suppose that we stand this up [DATE-1] on your website.
Agent: Like, we can't go back, right?
Agent: And like retroactively capture all the data.
Agent: So it can be if someone, if someone fills out a form, if you send like an email and we pick up on that referral source of them coming to the website from something like, for example, a [LOC-1] email, we then know who that individual is that way.
Agent: So there's, there's other ways that it can be done outside of just filling out
Agent: A form, but that's the most clear one, if you will.
Agent: So it's mainly form or if they click from an email.
EndUser: Yeah, those are going to be those are two main ways that we'd start to
Agent: Pick up on it. Well, if
Agent: They click from an email, we already know who they are, right?
EndUser: Yeah, we stitch it together, right?
EndUser: Okay, one other quick question if I could so with regard to the anonymous person, so like as we said about the bebacks. So I just want to clarify something you said, [PERSON-5].
EndUser: So if they don't play their cookies or whatever, and they come back and then they tend days later, they come back again and then the [ORG-14] they fill out the form, but those proceeding days, they were there like three or four times.
EndUser: Is all that history track then till now that it's
Agent: Robbed that we know it's robbed?
Agent: Is that tracked or no?
Agent: Yes, because you should go back. Go back. Go back one slide. Look at that. Look at that larger profile. So this isn't a great example, but below that affinity profile, should have been a larger picture by that.
Agent: There's a timeline, right?
Agent: So that orange component there, that orange component at the very end of that timeline, it's colored. That indicates that there was like, it typically indicates like a conversion. So we'll track those all over time.
Agent: And then the larger the bubble, that essentially just indicates a longer session. So like a longer amount of time on the site. So we'll track that again, even when they're anonymous, up into the point that they do convert.
Agent: And when they do convert, we'll take any anonymous data that we've captured from an affinity perspective, and then it'll become part of that known profile. Okay. Yep. Great. So this profile can be used in a lot of ways.
Agent: For example, you know, [PERSON-7] and I, we were on the phone with a customer [DATE-19]. One of their use cases is.
Agent: They want to do communications to folks that are showing strong interest in [ORG-19], high-end talent was what they called it. So for them, that primarily is based off of time spent browsing specifically electric vehicles.
Agent: So we can utilize that data within that profile to start to utilize it for segmentation.
Agent: So just as an example, give me folks that have viewed been browsing electric vehicles for [TIME-1] in [DATE-31].
Agent: Or give me individuals that favorit e vehicle category is electric vehicle, just as an example in favor, that refers back to that affinity profile. That's going to be someone's top specific area of engagement based on those different affinities.
Agent: You could also use it for a variety of different what we call triggers that come out of the box with the platform. So, for example, like an abandoned event.
Agent: So, if we know who they are, individuals that partially completed a form for financing, for example, but didn't get all the way through the process.
Agent: Could be an example of one use case that we could deploy through the out of the box triggering mechanisms that come with the tool. Next slide, [PERSON-7]. This is kind of an anonymous user example.
Agent: So suppose someone comes to the website, we don't know who they are. They start browsing [ORG-19] used vehicles. They see that the make or the trim level that they're looking for isn't currently in stock.
Agent: So as an example, suppose that they start to leave the website. The tool comes with a variety of out-of-the-box, we call campaigns. One of them is an exit intent camera. campaign.
Agent: So it could be as they start to leave the website is the mouse starts to move toward s the corner. We trigger an alert targeted at those segments .
Agent: To try to capture some piece of information about them before they leave. It could be start the financing process.
Agent: Or another use case is if we see that someone's browsing a specific based on their filtering, vehicle or make model, et cetera, that's low in inventory, maybe it's just not the they don't have the trim level.
Agent: We don't have the trim level that they're looking for. So one other example of a call to action might be as they start to leave and as they start to leave, a provider email address or your phone.
Agent: Number will send you automated updates as new inventory comes into our location . So that plays into one of the triggers that comes out of the box is inventory based triggers.
Agent: So we can set up a rule that says if based on the website inventory and what's on the website, as vehicles come back into inventory based on someone's affinities and the vehicles they're interested in, we can send out automated SMS messages or automated [LOC-1] emails as that comes on kind of what's on the website.
EndUser: Back into inventory based If we know that. if we know them. Yep. I had another question on this.
EndUser: So as you're doing the exit thing and you know doing all this other stuff when Is this tool, can this tool be used to basically aggregate all the data that we're seeing sort of like [ORG-31] does?
EndUser: And the sense of like, okay, we see this behavior, you know, from 10 different individuals, when they go to this webpage, you know, they always exit, you know, stage left or whatever, because whatever they're doing beforehand.
EndUser: Because that would be powerful data in terms of knowing, like, is there something wrong with the website or like, you know, what is causing them to maybe exit or whatever?
EndUser: And then, as you said, like, triggering this behavior, does this tool do any of that based on all the data?
Agent: That it has, particularly for the anonymous people . I guess in general. All of the, it's a good question, [PERSON-1].
Agent: Let me go back and try to revisit like different reports that we have that come out of the box as it pertains to like anonymous users and some of the data that we provide back.
Agent: A lot of the reporting that does come out of the box that I'm a little bit more familiar with is like when you deploy one of these campaigns is a lot of what we end up doing is tracking we track like number of impressions, number of conversions, number of non-conversions, things of that nature.
Agent: But let me go back and see what reports come out of the box that are, if we have any that are in line with what you're asking about.
Agent: So, but most of the reports that I'm familiar with, they kind of lean into what I was just saying. But also another component of this is any campaigns that you do build out can be [ORG-31] tested.
Agent: So a lot of the reports also focus on that is if we want to try out multiple different experiences for trying to capture an anonymous user base,
EndUser: Which experience is the most performant in the world. in terms of, in this case, what we'd be most interested in which is form fills . lead acquisition. And that means inter-preservation, but certainly before we end.
Agent: If we could focus on this,
EndUser: I would like to see, and [PERSON-19] correct me if you know, if you want something different, but I would actually like to see four existing guests, because we've talked a lot about the anonymous piece.
EndUser: I would like to see for existing guests, what can we do on the journey build out?
EndUser: Because what we're trying to do is use our existing [ORG-2] database, now with data.
Agent: Because it's very rich
EndUser: Our Marketing Cloud instance obviously has all of our marketing that we've done to these people. And then if we put something like this on top of it, or as an overlay, It's giving us a rich set of analytics.
EndUser: So as a use case, as an example, entity.
Agent: [PERSON-1] is a known I start shopping
EndUser: I come in, on the website, I come back, I have a B-back. And [ORG-2] knows that we have an open lease retention campaign or lease retention opportunity as an example.
EndUser: I guess the first question is, how do these two, interact with these data sets?
Agent: How does marketing client [ORG-2]
EndUser: In other words, can we connect them together?
EndUser: Obviously, they're connected.
EndUser: But can we connect them together specifically?
EndUser: So then in real time, I know that [PERSON-1] just came into the website [PERSON-1] also has a least retention opportunity.
EndUser: And based on that behavior of what [PERSON-1]'s doing, I know, okay, he's about to apply for financing or he's doing something because that could either trigger an email campaign, an SMS, or it could actually trigger a personalization journey, meaning that we actually send an alert out to the salesperson or the sales manager at the store that says this person's actually ready to potentially convert to the sale, so they reach out to them right away.
EndUser: So those would be like the specific use cases.
EndUser: So how does this tool handle that in terms of being able to do the connection and be able to recognize?
EndUser: And also what parameters can we put in to say like if they apply for financing or if they do
Agent: This or they do that ?
Agent: Do these steps based upon the journeys like how that how does that work?
Agent: Yep, all right Well, we've got some [ORG-14] pertaining to that and we can kind of showcase what that might start to look like Skip past this one [PERSON-7] So you mentioned one use case, and I'll get into the sales force, like sales experience here in a moment.
Agent: But suppose you have a known user, right?
Agent: And somewhere within [PRODUCT-4], you've got data pertaining to vehicles that they currently have on lease with you all.
Agent: Um, in addition, also related to that, you might have like a lease end date that's stored as part of that vehicle that an individual owns. Suppose that's stored within [PRODUCT-4]. Let me know if it's not. But.
Agent: What we could utilize that data for is we could also utilize that for presenting a targeted web experience to a known user So for example, [PERSON-19], he's got a least [ORG-19] vehicle with us That expiration for that lease is up in [DATE-19] He comes back to the website We know who he is We might present him with a different call to action around explore lease and options, for example So it can update the experience in real-time that I receive when I come back to the website So all kinds of.. of strong capabilities here, whether it 's lease-end, service reminders,
EndUser: All kinds of different u se cases that we can start to think [PERSON-19] from a web experience [ORG-19] e. Brad, next slide. I really have a question. You know, you know, my question is everyone that works.
EndUser: One other question on that technically though, do we, because we have manufacturer requirements to use certain websites and stuff and vendors, does this interact with the website?
Agent: Or do we have to build our websites in this tool?
Agent: Like, because it seems like this tool is doing a lot of like website manipulation in the sense of like what it's serving up and pages and stuff.
Agent: How does that work?
Agent: It all just sits on And the tools primarily just going to interact with existing divs to replace [ORG-14] that exists on the website currently.
EndUser: Top of it.
Agent: Okay. Yep. But it can all have the same, like, look and feel branding, like CSS, etc. And all of them just kind of inherits that.
Agent: So it's not like a, it's not going to be like a drastically different look and feel for any campaigns that you end up deploying.
Agent: There's an element of this that sits in with like, there's a recommendation engine to this that can be plugged into [LOC-1] emails, as well as surface to a sales rep that's in [FAC-2] around recommendations.
Agent: So based on my recent browsing behavior, these are other vehicles that we think you'd be interested in. So plugs into [LOC-1] emails well.
Agent: And then the other side of this, to get into [PERSON-1], some of the things that you were mentioning is the salesperson experience. So if we know that someone has an upcoming. Really quick kind of piggybacking
EndUser: Off of [PERSON-1]'s question for the website.
EndUser: So would this in a sense be a micro site that's overlaying on top?
EndUser: Or would it still be [ORG-28] Mercedes dot com
Agent: That they're converting on?
Agent: But still be [ORG-28] Mercedes dot com.
EndUser: So when they fill out the form and convert, is that going into?
EndUser: The back end of our site, which then feeds into [ORG-2], or is it going into [ORG-2] directly?
Agent: It wouldn't change, like we're not talking about changing the order of operations here in terms of like where the data flows when someone fills out a form. We're just picking up on that conversion that takes place.
Agent: So if it goes into FJ286 you all right now, it would continue to operate that same in similar capacity.
Agent: Okay... Exactly... Yeah, as opposed to a microsite or take into like a separate like type landing page, [PERSON-13], personalization deploys a pixel or a beacon, if you will, that's on top the pixel on our site.
EndUser: Of [ORG-26]. Okay, so we just would include Correct.
Agent: Yes.
Agent: And then as part of the Implementation process, like it would either be like salt click or some or a personalization partner that would help you guys map out, you know, your website in terms of the areas that we would want to be able to personalize to then be able to offer dynamic content.
Agent: But there's no change to the actual website. It's compact.
Agent: Sorry, I have to be button compatible with your [ORG-26] and everything. So yeah, it's not like a separate microsite. It's just a pixel that you can deploy it on your existing website that then adjusts the information. Okay.
EndUser: After all this aside from this, do you guys have a live site of somebody else utilizing it that we could take a look at or do you have a dev site of actual?
Agent: The intention is, I can build out a demo that would, I have the ability to deploy this technology, I'm not actually deploying it to your site, but I can come and show a demonstration of what it would look like on your site.
Agent: But certainly I can provide you a couple examples of customers that are utilizing.
EndUser: As well that you can play around with. Okay, perfect,
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: So sales example, right, for someone that's maybe living in [ORG-28] 410. So that web activity can trigger something like an alert, for example, to that individual.
Agent: In that instance, we're gonna be leveraging kind of a combination of the data that's being captured by personalization. And, information that's stored in [PRODUCT-4].
Agent: So for example, we could have something like an automation that based on web behavior triggers someone to enter into a journey builder journey. from there within that journey.
Agent: Like, for example, and I'm not exactly familiar with how you've architected [FAC-2], but suppose on the contact or person account level, there's a roll-up summary field or something like that is like number of leases expiring in [DATE-28].
Agent: If that's greater than zero, we can use that as the decision point in a journey. And then based on that data point, trigger something like an alert to a sales person based on that web activity.
Agent: Letting them know that they've got an existing customer that's showing a lot of interes t and maybe they should be reaching out to them about lease and options Or you have a customer that you've worked with in the past that was on the website completed a financing application partially or started looking at financing options for a vehicle .
Agent: You should reach out to them or see how things are going with their current vehicle, right?
EndUser: Those are all use cases use case that you gave [PERSON-31], which was you know the hyper interest or whatever how much customization do we have over that like the one where they complete The finance from whatever that's a click into and so that would be like an action Well, like let's say they're just accumulating site visits.
Agent: On the first
EndUser: Can we identify
Agent: And say?
Agent: Don't send like an alert into like site visits reaches acts or they do certain behaviors. Yes and the way that you do that [PERSON-1] is We showed an example [PERSON-7].
Agent: I'm gonna ask you to click around exit on this slide If you'll mind go back to slide 14
Agent: So what you can do is when you're building out a segment, all of that information around all the tracking that we're doing can be utilized in segmentation. It's like [PERSON-1], to your example, let's drop folks into a segment.
Agent: If they've come to the website at least 10 times in [DATE-26], right?
Agent: We can deploy a segment off of that. Any segment that we build here is just an audience that we can use in a journey builder in either journey.
Agent: Builder or for just if you don't want to send any sort of [ORG-14] out to them, you coul d just do something like generate an automated task . There's also a component of this.
Agent: If you just wanted to send like [DATE-26] reports out to sales folks. So who's essentially fallen into this segment. They can also communicate it that way. I suppose probably the would be a task generation.
EndUser: More clean way to do it
Agent: So what you're, what you're asking about [PERSON-1] though, right in the wheel out of what we're talking about. Okay. Thanks. Yep. Sorry about that, [PERSON-19]. If you don't mind, go to slide 19. So generate something like an alert.
Agent: This information also surfaces so that affinity profile, when we were showing it earlier, we were showing it within [PRODUCT-5], but the details from an affinity perspective also surface within, can be surfaced within [PRODUCT-4].
Agent: So, [ORG-32] spent browsing specific vehicles, time spent browsing the website over the course of [DATE-32], etc.
Agent: As well as just what we call an engagement feed, that's just essentially the full like cookie crumb trail of like everything they've done on the website, all of that can be embedded within the [ORG-2] user interface.
Agent: So that we can have a more informed conversation with that individual or just know that someone is starting to express more interest based on their web activity.
EndUser: Sorry, I ran them questions before I forget it. You don't have to change the slide, [PERSON-28]. With regard to the anonymous, you give us the URL that they're coming source.
Agent: From, correct?
Agent: Or that's for the referral
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: There's also, well, I guess one other just thing that we can talk, we can showcase this a little bit more in a future call, but there is a variety of other data points that we do capture outside of just like locational information so we can use that location information for understanding like.
Agent: Weather in the area, things of that nature.
Agent: So I'll have to do some thinking on it, but my guess is there's probably some use cases around some of the data that we do provide that would be relevant to your industry.
Agent: We can talk about that in an actual demonstration once I think about it a little bit further. Okay, so this was the last slide that I wanted to showcase as it relates to some of the use cases.
Agent: Again, just kind of like taking a step back here.
Agent: Really what we're trying to do is that deep level of tracking for every individual that's coming to the site, anonymous and known, and then utilize that for deploying more personalized experiences, whether that's Marketing Cloud emails, potentially even, you know, like we showcased impacting my experience when I come to the website, but then also like making sure that this information gets over to someone in sales so that they know if they've got an existing customer that's starting to really express.
Agent: Strong signs of interest .
Agent: Thoughts on kind of what we covered off on.
Agent: Is this something we would want to explore in a demonstration?
Agent: I
Agent: Know you have a lot on your plate, so be honest with us.
EndUser: Yeah, I think it's actually an obviously in noble consignment as well. I think it's very interesting. I'll be candid. I think it's more interesting on the existing outside than on the anonymous side right now.
EndUser: But I think that the Any type of demo if we move forward, I think would be probably geared more towards that. And last on the anonymous side, absolutely we want to see the capabilities there.
EndUser: But anything we do on the anonymous side, I think, would be paired up with a data source that we would have via the intersect or something else.
EndUser: So that would need to prove itself out by getting more data because simply knowing the anonymous came in and did that stuff, we can get that through [ORG-31]. I mean, it's interesting for sure.
EndUser: But it's not like boiling the ocean per se.
EndUser: The stuff on the other side, though, I think, is actually the other side, I think, is actually much more interesting in terms of what we could do on the journeys and personalizing that, because I think that actually has more relevance to something that [PERSON-13] and I have kind of been on this journey on for a while, trying to find ways to do that.
EndUser: So I think that actually I think speaks more more to it in terms of like that. So I think if we did end up electing to do a demo, I think it should be there.
EndUser: But let me please chime in and know as well.
EndUser: Yes, fully in line with [PERSON-1]. I think we kind of maybe look at this in [DATE-19]. And see where we stand at that point.
EndUser: But yeah, I think for our current customers, this is in line with what we'd like to do.
EndUser: It's the low hanging fruit, right?
EndUser: Those are the people who are, we already have information. They know us as a brand, they trust us, but we're not guaranteed their next sale or even their next service.
EndUser: So, if we can get a better read on them, then absolutely.
Agent: Perfect. We can definitely plan to focus
EndUser: A little bit more on the known folks. I think
Agent: Too.
Agent: Did you have any side?
Agent: Did you have any feedback?
Agent: No, I think we agree. I think the best use case of it is on people we know because again it doesn't sort of enhance and try to figure out who people are from other data sets.
Agent: And so yeah, I think for us, I mean in terms of [DATE-10], it's not going to be the highest priority for us. But yeah, it's something we could definitely
EndUser: Look at like [DATE-41], a little more in depth. Yeah, so what I'm going to do guys is then we can go into the final section over coming up to time.
EndUser: I'm going to talk with [PERSON-15] about it during my one on one on [DATE-31].
EndUser: Just to let her know like the capabilities of what I saw kind of at high level and then let her know that you guys would potentially like to prepare a demo, whatever if we want to move forward.
EndUser: I'll let you guys know what her feedback is. And then we like we said we could prepare sometime in [DATE-19] for something like that.
EndUser: I mean to be candid, our plate is extremely full as I mentioned, but I do think that this actually adds.
Agent: This purchase, his service history, his behavioral history, as well as sales history, and then even any other third party data sources that come and play.
Agent: Just know that this would probably be a next logical step for you guys as you introduce datasets that don't primarily live in [ORG-2] [DATE-1].
EndUser: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah, no, I think that's actually interesting. I think we actually have a lot of that without maybe the third party data perspective.
Agent: I think in terms of the prioritization, at this personalization first and we keep an eye on this for the future.
EndUser: We definitely want to look Yeah, cool.
Agent: I think with that being said, the last thing that I will say, and I know we're pushing up right against time here, someone to let you guys have is, you know, noble, you probably know this right but in regards to just our, you know, timeline sales forces into fiscal right is [DATE-13] right so while I know we're pushing up against holidays and stuff here too, I would say, why don't we send this information to you guys, you know, slide where is a follow up.
Agent: So you can have the conversation with [PERSON-15] on [DATE-31], [PERSON-1], if it sounds like there's interest.
Agent: We're happy to schedule a follow-up more detaile d [PERSON-26] demonstration in the platform in [LOC-1] that's tailored to your use cases focusing kind of on the existing customer We can do that before, we can do it after the holidays But from my standpoint being able to get you guys best pricing if you guys are able to evaluat e and make a decision in [DATE-13] certainly we can probably pull some more string s to get you guys better discount s than we're normally able to leverag e to other stream times of [DATE-2] .
Agent: So, know you have a lot on your plate.
Agent: You know, we can take direction from you, but we are happy to run at this for you guys and see if, you know, it makes sense and gets you guys obviously a lot of dollar pricing.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I certainly appreciate that. I think the timing is going to be more driven by current prioritization level to be candid. I mean, it's very interesting software. I don't want the approval though predicated on.
EndUser: I don't want the approval to be potentially messed up based on timing because again, there are a lot of stuff.
EndUser: It will be a bit of a big sell actually, not necessarily to the business side actually, but to the [ORG-19] because he has very strict goals and guidelines for us on update 519.
EndUser: And it will have to be a very, very compelling use case for us to talk with him about funding additional things right now.
EndUser: Again, I think there's value here, but I don't want to rush it because I think we have to do it in the right timeline.
EndUser: Because this question is going to be the same one that I asked, I believe, which is how are you possibly going to implement this with everything else you have going on and all the top priorities I gave you.
EndUser: So that's kind of the lay of the land. So I don't want two forsake the software approval potentially for the timing. I do understand what you're saying. And obviously we'll take that into account.
Agent: But I want to make sure that we're driving it at the right time so that it doesn't kind of go
Agent: Into a little bit of a buzz off that makes sense. Absolutely. Look, and we'll take direction on that from you guys. Go ahead, man. Yeah, I was going to add in there too.
Agent: Like we hear you [PERCENT-1] we don't want to like sell you software that you're not going to be able to use right away, right?
Agent: But I think to [PERSON-7]'s point, if it is as we go through an evaluation, like if this is something that you guys find to be extremely valuable, getting the lowest price is something that we can only do in [DATE-13], but we can get creative on the contracting side to make the CFO happy, right?
Agent: Like we can push out start gates. We can kind of better align to the Implementation timeline that you guys do have when it comes to resourcing to make that. side of it justifiable as well too.
EndUser: So just because you buy in [DATE-13] doesn't mean that you hav e to start implementing a [DATE-13].
Agent: So this is something that keep in mind too . Okay, thank. Perfect. Yeah, I appreciate the time.
Agent: Any other questions?
Agent: Anything else you need from us?
Agent: I'll get you a copy of [DATE-1]'s recording. You can share with some of them as well as these slides.
Agent: And then why don't we touch base maybe right before we break for [DATE-41], maybe early part of [DATE-42],
EndUser: [PERSON-20], if that's all right after you have your conversation with [PERSON-15] and you can let us know kind of where you'd like to take things and what timeline looks like.
EndUser: Actually, could you do this, [PERSON-7], and [WORK_OF_ART-1], if you're okay with it. So I, and if it's too much work or whatever, just let me know.
EndUser: Could you give a preliminary, I mean, to the thing of pricing now again, please don't take this as it's going to be a fruit in [DATE-13], but could you give us a potential understanding of like what a pricing would look like because that will come into play at some point.
EndUser: Again, there's a lot of steps between now and then but if you could share that with noble
Agent: So we at least have a
Agent: Ballpark of what we're looking at, because that will help inform kind of our next steps as well and as we kind of look at it. Sure, I agree. I'm happy to do that.
Agent: I think there's a couple metrics on how to collect from you guys. Kind of like average website traffic is the primary one. Because a lot of things in marketing cloud, it's utilization phase.
Agent: And so we can build in the number of web traffic, make sure that we have you guys on the right version. And then that would give me a baseline to go to give you guys some pricing on it.
Agent: So I can shoot that over to you via email. And if you can get that back to me here before [DATE-46], I can probably turn around some
EndUser: High level price in [GPE-13]. Yeah, [PERSON-13], if it's not too much trouble again, like I know what's going on, could you maybe just give them the specs
EndUser: For like [ORG-41] since it's the law largest one?
EndUser: And then we could just
Agent: Get at least a ballpark pricing on it. Sure.
Agent: By [DATE-48] or?
Agent: Yeah, [DATE-41] is fine.
EndUser: Yeah, [DATE-41] or you. Yeah.
Agent: Just just I mean, we just want some baseline averages and then we can go from there.
Agent: Overall traffic or unique?
EndUser: Actually, both if you have it, overall would be helpful, but unique would be helpful, if all to. Okay, yeah, it.
Agent: I can get that.
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-26]. I appreciate This was great.
EndUser: Thank you guys so much.
Agent: I was
EndUser: Good talking
EndUser: To you guys and we look forward to talking to you again soon.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer to this question is unclear. The customer did express interest in the product, particularly for existing guests, and saw potential use cases for it. However, they also mentioned that their plate is full and that approving the product would require a very compelling use case due to strict goals and guidelines. They asked for a preliminary understanding of the pricing, but this does not necessarily indicate that they feel the product meets their needs. It could be a part of their due diligence process.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if there were opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers' needs. The sales rep does ask several questions to understand the customers' needs and use cases, but it is not clear if more time should have been spent on this.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the personalization capabilities of the seller's product, particularly in terms of its potential impact on their existing customers. They mentioned that the tool could help them recognize and respond to existing customers' behavior on their website, such as by triggering personalized email or SMS campaigns or alerts to sales personnel. The customer also mentioned that they were interested in using the tool to enhance their lease retention efforts. However, they were less interested in the tool's capabilities for tracking anonymous users, and expressed a preference for focusing on known users in a potential demonstration. Overall, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product could help them better understand and engage with their existing customers, which they saw as a key priority.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"The customer expressed several concerns that could potentially prevent the deal from closing:

1. Current plate being extremely full: The customer mentioned that their plate is full, and they have a lot of ongoing initiatives. This could indicate that they might not have the bandwidth to implement and utilize the seller's product immediately.
2. Prioritization: The customer stated that the personalization aspect of the product is more interesting to them than the anonymous side. They also mentioned that they would prioritize this product after their current priorities. This shows that the deal might not be a high priority for the customer at the moment.
3. Approval process: The customer mentioned that getting approval for additional funding would be a big sell, especially since they have strict goals and guidelines. This could indicate that the approval process might be lengthy and challenging.
4. Timing: The customer was clear that they did not want to rush the approval process or implementation due to their current priorities. They also mentioned that implementing the product might not start immediately even if they approve it during the fiscal year.
5. Resource allocation: The customer expressed concerns about resource allocation for implementing the product. They want to ensure they have the necessary resources to effectively utilize the product.

""Does this make sense in terms of just kind of like what we're trying to achieve and some of the value drivers that it produces in terms of, you know, return on ad spend, higher quality leads, first party data, automated service reminders, product recall notifications, and being able to prove conversions, ROI, and lifetime value for customers?"" The customer showed more engagement after this question as they acknowledged the value of personalization in achieving their goals.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep could have done a better job summarizing the agenda and setting clear expectations for the discussion. This would have helped to focus the conversation and ensure that all participants were on the same page.
2. The sales rep could have provided more concrete examples of how the seller's product has helped other customers in the automotive industry. This would have helped to illustrate the value of the product and make it more relatable to the customer's business.
3. The sales rep could have done a better job explaining the specific features and capabilities of the seller's product, particularly in relation to personalization and data tracking. This would have helped the customer to better understand how the product could be used to achieve their specific goals and objectives.
4. The sales rep could have provided more detailed information about the pricing and implementation timeline for the seller's product. This would have helped the customer to better understand the costs and timeline associated with implementing the product, and would have allowed them to make a more informed decision.
5. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep could have done a better job summarizing the key points of the discussion and recapping the next steps. This would have helped to ensure that all participants were on the same page and had a clear understanding of what needed to be done next.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The customer had several concerns about the seller's product. They were interested in the personalization aspect of the product, but they were also considering other vendors for personalization or related projects. They mentioned that they had started to explore tools for website tracking and personalized data based on that tracking. However, they had feedback that the data from the vendor they were testing was somewhat questionable. They also wanted to understand more about the initial use cases that the seller had in mind for their product.

Additionally, the customer had concerns about the timing of the project, as they were busy with other initiatives and had a lot on their plate. They also mentioned that there were specific goals and guidelines that they had to meet, and any new software approval would have to be a very compelling use case for them to talk with their CFO about funding.

Overall, the customer was interested in the personalization aspect of the product, but they had concerns about the timing, the cost, and the effectiveness of the product, as well as the data provided by other vendors they were considering.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or not. It is also unclear who the correct person would be if they were not on the call. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The sales representative does mention scheduling a follow-up demonstration, but it is not confirmed if this will take place or not."

Speaker 10: Alright, everybody able to see the salesforce demonstration screen?
EndUser: Yeah, yes, yes.
Speaker 10: Perfect. I've got it on a second monitor. I'll be going back and forth with how my eyes are looking. So don't get too distracted with that.
Speaker 10: But we're excited to show you what salesforce can do per [ORG-1] properties [DATE-1]. We appreciate everyone taking the time to meet with us. And we're going to jump right into it. So we got a good amount to cover.
Speaker 10: So this is a forward looking statement slide. This is a part of every [ORG-2] presentation. Everything that we're going to cover [DATE-1] is readily available in [ORG-2] now. It's been available for a while as well.
Speaker 10: But should we encounter anything?
Speaker 10: Whether [DATE-1] or down the road that might be on a roadmap and not a readily available feature of [ORG-2]. This is just saying make your decisions based on what's available now.
Speaker 10: This really gives us the ability to pivot based on market conditions.
Speaker 10: So the agenda for [DATE-1]'s discussion will go over some introductions on our side. We've met some of the folks and then of course with LinkedIn and everything else. We kind of gotten to know you also.
Speaker 10: We don't want to spend a whole lot of time on the introduction side, We'll give a little bit of an overview of [ORG-2] as well. We'll hop into the demonstration.
Speaker 10: The reason we're all here, then we'll have some Q&A in next steps. But with that said, thank you.
Speaker 10: We'll see at the end here, but [PERSON-1] and a few others on the team have already spent a good amount of time with us, really giving us an overview of the use case for [ORG-2] at [ORG-1] properties, some of the technical requirements.
Speaker 10: [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] were fantastic at [LAW-1] as kind of figuring out your current processes as they relate [DATE-1].
Speaker 10: And we've taken all that information and compiled it together along with the requirements that were provided to us and really tried to make this demonstration as relevant as possible for you.
Speaker 10: So thank you for the time that you've invested thus far. as well as the time that you're investing [DATE-1] to meet with us We really appreciate it . So this is your [ORG-2] team.
Speaker 10: I'm the one talking, your [ORG-2] and [GPE-1] my team, I should say. So for those of you that I have not met, [PERSON-4], I am the Account Executive from [ORG-2]. It's responsible for our overall relationship.
Speaker 10: With [ORG-1] property, so nice to meet you. Then I'll let [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] introduce themselves, and we'll do [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-8] and jump into it.
Agent: All right. Hi everybody. My name is [PERSON-9], a Senior Solutions Engineer at [ORG-2].
Agent: I'm basically [PERSON-10]'s counterpart when it comes down to technical discovery, as well as demonstrations, been at [ORG-2] for [DATE-2], been doing solutioning for [DATE-3].
Agent: Nice to meet you all and excited to present to you [DATE-1].
Agent: Hi all nice to meet you. My name is [PERSON-13]. I'm part of [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-5]'s team here on the, and I support the business development side of the team.
EndUser: Good [TIME-1] everyone. My name is [PERSON-11]. I am with the [NORP-1] team. So we help support everything that [ORG-2] does from an Implementation standpoint. I'm the senior account executive.
EndUser: So you will be hopefully hearing from me in the future to coordinate all of these fun meetings that we have and that we're heartbroken if we have to miss.
Agent: And then I'm [PERSON-10], also in the [NORP-1] team. You know, as [PERSON-7] said, you know, we partner with [ORG-2] across the board, but we really specialize in partnering with real estate.
Agent: And my background has been, you know, spending my career consulting and working in industry for a few different firms, worked at [GPE-2] retail for [DATE-4].
Agent: So very intubally familiar with retail malls and how we can help with the leasing processes. I'm excited to be here [DATE-1].
Speaker 10: Perfect. So I know [ORG-2] might be new to several of you that are on the call [DATE-1].
Speaker 10: So one of the things we always like to discuss first when talking about [ORG-2] is our core values, is they really guide everything we do.
Speaker 10: In top of the list is trust, right?
Speaker 10: It's our number one value. And it really means that we act with transparency and lead with our ethics. Then we have customer success. With our customers aren't successful, we are not successful.
Speaker 10: So we prioritize our customer success and thus the success of your customers or tenants or future tenants. And also innovation.
Speaker 10: We want our products to be the most relevant, easy to use, integratable and global products out there that have a really, really fast time to value for our customers. inequality.
Speaker 10: We believe that everything is better when we're all working together, going in the same direction. And sustainability, that's a new one for us as of [DATE-5].
Speaker 10: I saw on your website that that's a big part of what y'all do as well. But everything rests on a stable climate. So we're helping every organization achieve net zero and leading by example as a net zero company.
Speaker 10: So that sales force in our core values.
Speaker 10: And then we have our, I don't know, [ORG-3] slide, if you want to call it that, I'm not sure what you want to call about, but this really shows [ORG-2] market share versus our top four competitors and really the reason I show this is not to be.
Speaker 10: Boisterous or brag on [ORG-2]. I'm very proud to work here, but it's our customers that have put us in this position and continue to do so.
Speaker 10: Without them and their success, they wouldn't choose [ORG-2], it wouldn't give us the ability to become number one and continue the gap that we have. So we're very proud of that due to that.
Agent: Sorry. And then, you know, [PERSON-10] just kind of led you through [ORG-2]'s core values and, you know, kind of their beliefs. [PERSON-19] very much a industry-led firm.
Agent: So I just love to flash up some of the folks that we work with. These are all [ORG-2] partners as well. They're, you know, organizations that have really figured out how to get the value out of this platform.
Agent: And so we try to reference these as much as possible with stories on our website references, things like that. Just want to call out that we're an industry-led group that loves to help real estate.
Speaker 10: Perfect. And with that, we've made it to the demonstration. The reason we're all here. So let's show you what [ORG-2] looks like.
Speaker 10: And we're going to [PERSON-5] will take the wheel and go over everything as it relates to [ORG-2] here.
Speaker 10: But we'll show you what it looks like from a leasing agent perspective, as well as from a VP perspective, kind of how your day-to-day goes. And feel free, we want this to be collaborative.
Speaker 10: So if you have any questions, mid-demo, feel free to chime in. We want this to be interactive and we're here to make sure that you have a solid understanding of how [ORG-2] can benefit [ORG-1] properties.
Agent: Before I get started, are there any questions this far?
Agent: Feel free to ask.
Agent: All right. So like [PERSON-10] said, demonstration [DATE-1] will be framed through the experience of a leasing agent, so especially leasing in this case for [PERSON-11].
Agent: It doesn't have to be limited to specialty could be also a perm and we could talk about how like that variance can happen later on the presentation but from a demonstration standpoint I'm going to focus on specialty more so.
Agent: The customer is going to be [PERSON-19] she's going to be an event coordinator for an organization for the [PERSON-14] small, I believe that's small that you all often use as an example in [LOC-1] So we asked like which was the best one in terms of property to use and so w e that was what was given to us and so that's how we're going to go through the demonstration as well .
Agent: All right.
Agent: Can everybody see my screen okay?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: All right, so the first thing going in through the lens of [PERSON-10], the first thing that I'm going to do typically throughout my day is check my email. Right.
Agent: So the first thing I see is that [PERSON-19] has set through an email for the [ORG-1] team and she's interested in leasing for holiday events. She's a representative of sketches.
Agent: She wants to lease out a specific area within the [PERSON-14] play small in order for her holiday about for sketches. So that's kind of the example that we went through. Again, for demonstration. purposes.
Agent: And a [ORG-2] panel. So there are a number of ways that you can actually log like emails directly into [ORG-2].
Agent: We have a bidirectional sync with Outlook, which means that emails can go directly into [ORG-2] as well as back into Outlook.
Agent: What's happening here that I have in the right hand panel is that I have a manual log button. That doesn't always have to be the case. We can set up [FAC-1], which is automated.
Agent: So every email would be captured and linked based on the records that you have on the email. email address.
Agent: It'll directly link into the record for [ORG-2] and I'll show you wha t that looks like when we get into the platform itself .
Agent: Just wanted to note that a lot of the components within [ORG-2], you can access within this panel and Outlook too. Say I wanted to create a task, activity, a new account.
Agent: I can actually do all that within the panel itself as well.
Agent: Does it slow me down and actually adds to my productivity as I'm going through the platform?
Agent: Any questions regarding this?
Agent: Does this look in-act similar if you're in the desktop version of it?
Agent: Yes, so how I'm doing it is I'm actually going through the browser. It's just an add on. You can add it onto the desktop version as well. So it would just be slightly, it's the same component.
Agent: You're going to have all the same stuff and all the abilities to edit and change whatever is visible on the panel itself. It's just a little bit different in terms of how you're adding it in.
Speaker 10: Yeah, [PERSON-1], prior to coming to [ORG-2], I used [ORG-2] in an outlook, actual application versus the web browser.
Speaker 10: And kind of like where you see print, discover groups, it was just a tab like that, and you could expand it or contract it that way it didn't take up some of your screen if you didn't want it to.
Speaker 10: But yeah, it works just the same.
Agent: So after [PERSON-23] responds to the email, [PERSON-20] actually looks through and goes through her existing inbox, she actually wants to go into the [ORG-2] platform itself. So with her credentials, she logs into [ORG-2] as a whole.
Agent: So I'm going to show the actual login portion of it because it's just username and password. There wasn't asked about SSL, which can be done.
Agent: So you can do SSL logins as well as we have two-factor authentication that is required.
Agent: So there's a lot of security that goes about getting into your instance as well as the right user is accessing the platform correctly And so there's a lot of security on that too So the first thing is first, [PERSON-10], she logs into [ORG-2] with her credentials.
Agent: She's able to see right at our homepage some information, right This is all to help her prioritize her day as well as understand her overall performance So there's a lot right now, so I'm going to go through each component and then you can ask any questions if you have any questions right?
Agent: So what I'm seeing right in front on the left hand side, you see this leasing dashboard is for individual reps. This is for [PERSON-10] specifically. These are all dashboards that are created based off reports.
Agent: And that report those reports. I'll go into more detail on how you can edit and create the m.
Agent: Off of information that's existent within [ORG-2] platform.
Agent: So all of these are representations for [PERSON-10] to understand, hey, what least is this you have executed, what's overall pipeline look like, what's the forecast look like?
Agent: We can also gamify and have a leaderboard for, say, all their sales reps and see how they're performing as well. So all this is just to help her understand her. priority as well as her overall performance.
Agent: Another component on the right hand side that's able to help her understand her priority is looking at the tasks that she has available. So tasks are, again, a to-do list for [PERSON-10] specifically. She can create tasks for herself.
Agent: Other members of the team can create tasks for her, as well as she can create tasks for other people as well. So this is all basically what she has to do [DATE-1]. And it's his priority and set.
Agent: Specifically in front of her on our home page so she can ask us it really quickly Another component is the ability to look at [DATE-1]'s events.
Agent: So these are say calls or meetings o r dinners that are scheduled based off of your Outlook calendar and brought over into events a s well. So you can have multiple places to see the same information .
Agent: Now, before I move on, the homepage, this is specific to [PERSON-10]. So you can have, you know, dashboards that are relevant to specific profile types.
Agent: So if there is a leader, say, interface for homepage, the dashboards can be different. The components can be different. So all of these square boxes, we can remove them. We can change them. We can edit them.
Agent: They can be different for each type of role that's within the organization.
Agent: Any questions as far?
Agent: All right, so as [PERSON-10] looks through, she does have a meeting with [PERSON-26]. She had that email come through. She wants to actually go in and take a look a little bit more at [PERSON-19].
Agent: She is currently right now a lead, so she's going to take a look at the lead record for her and navigate directly to the lead itself.
Agent: But before I do that, actually, I want to take a look at my overall leads. I can actually do that by just going into the lead object right here and seeing all of this in a related list feed.
Agent: So what we call this is a regulated list. It's because there are a number of different records as we call it. So say [PERSON-19] has a lead is a record. She's fitting into this list view.
Agent: And she has a whole, [PERSON-10] has a whole list of multiple records within a specific view. What I can do here at [PERSON-10]'s, I can also look at my leads, but I can look at all leads.
Agent: I can have multiple different types of lists, and I can have it filtered in any specific way. Right now, these are filtered under my leads and a specific lead type.
Agent: So I can see, okay, this is what's important for me and what I wanna get through day to day. What I can also do is I can edit, inline, and change the information around the record directly here.
Agent: Within the platform itself, I can also what was asked before change the owner. So right now [PERSON-10], I'm [PERSON-10], so I'm owning this specific, these specific leads.
Agent: But if I wanted to change one or more to a different user because I'm going to be out or even if an executive was to change the specific leads owner to someone else, that can all be done within this view very easily.
Agent: You can do it within the record itself, but you could do multiple here. So I think that's an important point to call out as I know there,
Speaker 10: Whether it be through promotions or people moving on to other opportunities, you do have a decent amount of turnover, especially on the specialty leasing side.
Speaker 10: So if you have someone that leaves and they have 10 leads, instead of individually going, pointing and clicking and moving those leads to different owners, if you want to split them up between three people, then you can just Click the ones that you want to go to [PERSON-26], say, and then change the owner that way.
Speaker 10: So it's not having to go through one at a time. You can select as many as you want and kind of batch and move them.
Agent: Absolutely. And again, all these different columns are basically just there are fields within the record itself. So I'll show you how that looks like an actual record page in a little bit.
Agent: But you could display anything you would like here. So I have it based off of what we've gathered in terms of the information, the owner itself, the priority of the lead, as well as the lead source.
Agent: So having all that as well as the stage of the lead, having all that.
Agent: Is very effective for me to figure out okay, what do I have to handle next right so if I sort by priority?
Agent: I can see that [PERSON-26] is one of the high priorities. I can actually dive into the record itself Any questions as far
Agent: Is there any confusion with what i'm showcasing here [DATE-1]?
Agent: Is this something new that you know folks on the line have never seen before, or is it something that you've seen in the past?
EndUser: I think using is very intuitive. I don't know that we've seen it exactly in the past, but I mean, this is great. So thank you.
Agent: Awesome.
Agent: So I guess just real quick, then [PERSON-2], so it sounds like this way of managing leads resonates kind of with some of your existing processes.
Agent: Is that fair?
EndUser: It looks very much like a spreadsheet. It doesn't look like a sticky note, but it does look like a spreadsheet, so very comfortable. Great.
Agent: So I'm going to dive right back into the demonstration itself. Now I'm going to actually navigate to what we call a record, which is just the storage of all of [ORG-4] information. So here's the record.
Agent: And so going back to what was showcased to us during the reverse demo and some of the conversations we had during discovery, there's a lot of information around, hey, we have a lot in [PRODUCT-1] right now, how do we bring that into a platform like [ORG-2]?
Agent: So what I'm showcasing right now is the concept or an architect.
Agent: Of [ORG-2] is that, hey, we have an object, which is basically leads So all leads, that's your typical [PRODUCT-1] table, right And then you have Content like lead information, name, title specifically category, any relationships that they have in terms of what account it is .
Agent: And or say, lead referral, all of that is like [PRODUCT-2] that you typically have an [PRODUCT-1] like rose as well as columns. That would be stored within a record within [ORG-2].
Agent: So like, if you're translating from an [PRODUCT-1] document, you can have everything that you have in your [PRODUCT-1] document within [ORG-2]. And it'll be, it could be done one two one.
Agent: Now, we could do even more complex pieces where you're saying, Hey, I can, I want to put it in a formula field, for instance, right?
Agent: So all these are fields. I can edit them, but I can put it in a formula field. formula field and I want to aggregate some information I can do that as well .
Agent: But before I get too deep into the details piece, I'm going to go over just high level what you're looking at right now.
Agent: So top of the page is just general information that [PERSON-10] might need to make for [PERSON-26].
Agent: And then below that, you have this [ORG-5] that we typically like to look at, which is like your dominoes pizza tracker in terms of the stages of interacting with the lead.
Agent: And I'll explain a little bit further as we go through the demonstration of what that looks like when you're going to have conversion from a lead to an opportunity contact and account.
Agent: That I'll showcase that in a little bit. But what's helpful here is that [PERSON-26] as a rep can easily go through the different specific stages.
Agent: And understand what she has to do So for [DATE-6], she sees the guidance for succes s that's underneath the specific share o n that tells her what to do and what to do next .
Agent: If it's unqualified, she can easily just set it as unqualified. It will be removed from certain pipeline reports as well as information.
Agent: But if she continues working, there's another set of guidance or success that sits underneath and tells her what to do next.
Agent: So this is how you would kind of go through the Workflow of qualifying a specific lead and then moving them over into and converting them to an opportunity at a later stage.
Agent: Does that?
Agent: And also I know one of the things that was important was being able to determine the source of that lead. Mm-hmm. And so that's where we're getting into the details of the information itself.
Agent: So whether it be a specific category that you might be able to mark or pull the data in from, say I have a set for scholarly events, but there was mentioned for pop-ups, expose.
Agent: You can kind of categorize and customize the fields here, however you like.
Agent: And add whatever makes the most sense for your business as a whole, but also referral and lead sources, they can all come through a different methodology as well in terms of segmentation.
EndUser: So we can customize not just the values for the fields, but the fields that are included themselves. Correct. Everything here is configurable.
EndUser: Does that help?
Agent: So before I move on, I'm wanted to touch on the aspect of how you can actually engage with marketing.
Agent: So there is, we didn't do that much discovery around marketing aspects of it, but I didn't want to touch on this. There is the ability to add, say, [PERSON-26] to a marketing campaign.
Agent: So she can have campaign history as well as marketing journeys.
Agent: It's all connected, right?
Agent: So if you want that information to be stored in here and visualized for someone like [PERSON-10], she can easily access. and see this information as well.
Agent: And I would just add quickly. I think a cool way I've seen campaigns used in the past for specialties, like the rest being around even [DATE-7] right now.
Agent: You can just start to aggregate leads around what they happen to be interested in, what they're going for, sometimes just organizing those campaigns helps the teams collaborate better.
EndUser: Great. I have a quick question. On the guidance for success. It looks like importance of qualifying your lead. Is that a is that just a different color or is that a link that goes somewhere.
Agent: So it can be done in multiple ways. This for demo purposes is highlighted, and it is a redirect link, but it's not going to go to anything in particular.
Agent: But yeah, you can set specific links or Knowledge Articles or specific components in which you can redirect the user to see, hey, maybe I have a checklist that I have to go through, specifically.
Agent: You can link all that as well.
Agent: So would that link to something in [ORG-2]?
Agent: So would it like?
Agent: A [ORG-6] . It could be either or. OK. So I think it really depends on your use case.
Agent: And that's [PERSON-8] and the team is able to help you scope that out in the future in terms of setting it up.
Agent: Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, without going too deeply. So this is a kind of a cool opportunity as well to just create consistency for new folks in terms of process training.
Agent: You know, we can create links out to document repositories, checklists as [PERSON-5] was kind of saying, think of this as your way of helping folks get up to speed quicker, but also just having consistency and process and Workflow in the long term.
EndUser: Yeah, this is great. I just, I love it. Thank you.
EndUser: Very helpful for turnover.
Agent: Very much.
Agent: Now to continue on again, like I mentioned earlier, right?
Agent: Everything here is configurable. So I can remove these components. You can add different fields. You can change the field itself. You can change the Content of the field. You can change all the tabs up here.
Agent: This is again what [PERSON-8] and team is going to help with in terms of scoping as well as implementing what makes the most sense for you.
Agent: I do want to touch on the activities piece, which is saying any communication and engagement. So all of those emails that are sent to [PERSON-26], they'll actually all be stored. under the activity.
Agent: So you see my response to [PERSON-26] as well as her actual initial email.
Agent: All that is stored under the activity feed within [ORG-2] underneath her record so that if I, you know, had to transfer this over to another individual to help support.
Agent: They can actually just look at all the engagement history and see what they're calm where the conversation has been. Where are we at now it's very easy to get up to date right.
Agent: I can also email directly out from here. I can also see any tasks that are related. and events that are related, tasks that are overdue, all listed underneath this kind of activity dashboard .
Agent: Or activity component within the record itself. And this, again, translates throughout the process of actually converting, qualifying this lead, and moving it on to the next stage.
Agent: Any questions there?
Agent: Yeah, so the benefit of having all the activities underneath here is that once you have all this information, certain salesforce, we'll get into how reporting looks, but it gives you a lot of advantages, right, to be able to report out on, hey, like, what's the engagement?
Agent: How many times have we engaged with this individual?
Agent: What's the likelihood for them to actually lease with us?
Agent: Like, a lot of those things can be done once you have all this information kind of stored in one location.
Agent: So before I actually convert this to an opportunity, I did want to touch on chatter, which is the collaboration tool that we have within [ORG-2] itself.
Agent: So we can actually at an individual, in this case, so if he is manager, that's at [PERSON-23] and mentioned, Hey, I need help with this specifically.
Agent: Can you jump in, right?
Agent: And if I share this, it will notify my manager, [PERSON-23], that there has been a post, and the post will be tracked, and it will allow us to collaborate on the specific record itself.
EndUser: So I want to touch on that piece as well. There was an ask for the at mention, as well as ability to collaborate within the record, and that's kind of how we would do it within [ORG-2].
EndUser: So how does that show up on [PERSON-23]'s side?
EndUser: Is that an answer?
Agent: Activity that's going to show up on his dashboard. Yeah, so for the post itself, what'll happen is there could be a notification that's listed up here when they're in the platform.
Agent: Or if you, depending on the setup, you could have it send an email notification that says, hey, within [PERSON-23]'s inbox, it'll say, hey, like you have a post directly from [PERSON-10], make sure you will be.
Agent: So there's a number of ways to set up the notification. It really depends on how you want to
EndUser: Notify that user.
Speaker 10: Yeah, the way we do it here at [ORG-2] is so we get the notification on the bell so it'll let us know real-time that that's happened and then we also get that email sent.
Speaker 10: It has a direct link to it that way you can like it, comment really do whatever is needed in order to satisfy the request that comes through.
EndUser: Perfect.
EndUser: And then the chatter stays with this lead.
Agent: Correct. Forever. Yeah, so it'll be stored within the record itself. There is like, we could talk about it at a later state. There is stuff about archiving the data, but we don't have to cover that now.
Agent: What will happen as well as this information will, once you're converting it over, it'll also populate, right?
Agent: So what we typically suggest in terms of a sales process is that you have your lead qualification, and then once, Revenue is decided to be associated with a specific record.
Agent: We can convert the lead over and there's another set of stages for the opportunity. So if I'm converting this, I would actually convert it to now an account, contact, and opportunity.
Agent: So opportunity is going to sort that specific opportunity for that user. Account is going to be sketchy in this case, which is the organization that the contact is working for. And then the contact would be [PERSON-19].
Agent: So they would be three separate records, technically, but they would be all associated together. This is the best way to track as well as organize the information that we've seen in industry.
Agent: And it's, you know, how we kind of structured it from a sales process wise and how most people handle it.
Agent: Can there be multiple opportunities per lead?
Agent: Yes.
Agent: That's like the reason, right?
Agent: So a lot of the times, like you're going to have multiple opportunities or multiple contacts under each account, right?
Agent: So I'll get into it once we got the opportunity itself. So say, you know, I converted over.
Agent: Now we have this opportunity, you know, different stages again, and you can again have different level, different guidance for success for each one, if you want. Um, but this is to help.
Agent: A leasing agent kind of go through the different stages that she needs to approach in order to close the business and make sure the lease is signed, as well as I know there's like an approval process that needs to happen sometimes.
Agent: And what was discussed was that sometimes, you know, the negotiations happened before the approval is approved.
Agent: And like, there's a number of ways that we can accommodate for that, but I'll talk to that as we go through the at different stages for what [PERSON-10] can do.
Agent: So the first thing I do want to mention is that all this information around activity, chatter, all of that record information around like lead referrals, all that can transfer over to the opportunity as well.
Agent: So that can be stored and existence. You're not copying information over, you're not having to re-input it, all of it's actually just stored and then moved over. So now you have it all in one location as well.
Agent: For the different stages here, this could be dependent on your process overall. You can change this however you like. So say you have five stages instead of how many I have here or you have a lot more.
Agent: You can actually change that however you like, add as many stages as you want, add as many guidance to success as you want as well.
Agent: Now the one thing I did want to know is that, If there is an approved process that you do have, right?
Agent: So say I set it to approval before I'm getting any lease signed or doing any negotiations, there might be an approval needed. This will actually.
Agent: Stop or stall the actual record itself and wait for a manager and or executive to approve the process. So you can actually put in an approval process and this will notify say [PERSON-23] in this case.
Agent: Hey, I need approval for this opportunity making sure all information is accurate. It's within our margins. Once that's approved, then they can move on to the lease signing process.
Agent: So there is a whole approval process that can be built in here so that there is no like back and forth or there's just overall more consistency. Any questions so far.
Agent: And at least so before you had talked about a few of the approvals, you know, not always necessarily happening at the perfect timing does do you think something like this helps address that.
EndUser: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
Agent: Great. I was going to say some groups do some really nice setups where they basically have this process auto populate the deal sheet for you more or less. So then it can feed super seamlessly into that approval process.
Agent: That would be wonderful. I have tears in my eyes.
Agent: All right, so now that you know we've gone through the high level opportunity that's going to what else is actually created underneath that.
Agent: So you have the account information right so we again have sketches right this might be an existing account already. And so what I want to look at is what's related underneath there. So I have the related context.
Agent: This is [PERSON-26] the contact that's associated with who we're speaking to on a regular basis.
Agent: You can't have multiple contacts here, right?
Agent: There might be other coordinators, executives, and or anything else that you can store all related to the kind of itself.
Agent: The opportunity is the sketch your holiday event, but you see that once I actually converted over, I had a Workflow in the background actually immediately create this renewal that is for the same time, but [DATE-8].
Agent: So I can have something like that in terms of Workflow actually automatically done.
Agent: So whether we pay our I want to trigger a task or I want to trigger a creation of a new opportunity to make sur e that the renewal happens [DATE-9], that can all be done, right We can actually automate that entire process so that nothing gets left and slips throug h the cracks .
Agent: Again, I see the account team here. You see the manager and you see [PERSON-10]. You can have all that kind of information stored in one location.
Agent: Questions as far?
Agent: All right. Again, just touching on the contact itself, being able to see all the information here, reaching out to them if I want to.
Agent: But I want to go back to the actual opportunity of 10 and look at the property that they're actually engaging with. And they're actually engaging with hands in place here, which is what it's related to.
Agent: And I'm seeing all this information based on the property itself as well.
Agent: So what I do want to touch on is that they're [TIME-2]. I do want to touch on the information that's available for the property itself. It could be say, this is more advanced.
Agent: So say you want to look at what units are available for the property, you can have a kind of broken down like this, as well as a rental bull area, if it's vacant, if there is a tenant moving in.
Agent: I know this is my view, like bridging the gap between perm and specialty, but you can also use this from the specialty standpoint as well. Yeah, move and move out.
Agent: So you might have individuals that are still moving in their own preparation, different stages. There might be.
Agent: Delayed in terms of moving out or taking down specific pieces, you can have all that kind o f listed out underneath the property itself .
Agent: And lastly, of course, if you want to attach say like a site plan, so this is both from [FAC-2] small site, you can have the site plan either attached in this case, underneath the [FAC-3] record and or we can get way more complex with it, but just to want to know that you could have all that information located in one location.
Agent: For the property itself.
Agent: How does this fare this far with what I've shown you all?
Agent: Is there any overall feedback?
Agent: You love it?
Agent: Does it hit everything that you're asking for?
EndUser: This is great. So as you're talking, I'm thinking, okay, I'm in love,
Agent: How are the teams in a real life scenario?
EndUser: So right now we're looking at one lead, which is [PERSON-26]. But on [DATE-10], an agent could be working with 25 people.
EndUser: And I know like the more tabs you get, the more stuff, you know, windows that are open, it can get overwhelming.
EndUser: So I mean, what does that look like?
EndUser: If I was working 10 things at the same time, or can I even do that?
Agent: Yeah, you definitely can, but I would say it really depends on how you want to manage the workflow. There's a number of ways to handle this.
Agent: Generally speaking, as an individual leasing agent, you're going to be primarily working on one person. You're going to have one engagement at a time. You can't have multiple engagements throughout [DATE-13].
Agent: Like you're going to probably be speaking with more than five two 10 people a day or even more than that.
Agent: But from a one-on-one perspective, if at this time I'm engaging with this user, I'm only going to be engaging with them. So generally speaking, you would have one record available.
Agent: And then there can be automation set in place to say notify of any tasks that have to be done and or any response that have to be given. And so.
Agent: That could be done through tasks, which is what I have listed out on the home page itself . here and or you can still have the different lead records available.
Agent: There's more complicated ways that we can handle it, but we wanted to keep it as simple as possible in terms of demonstration [DATE-1] to show you like, hey, the power of the platform itself.
Agent: But I'd love, [PERSON-8], do you want to jump in here and talk a little bit about
Agent: What they do in terms of managing?
Agent: Yeah, I know it was about to. I think what's cool about this piece is we can design it to be what is most useful for your team.
Agent: To your point, [PERSON-2], I think we always want to avoid too many screens open, too many things like that. And so we typically recommend that folks use tasks or that they work from a lead list.
Agent: Then you can very easily see who you've contacted most recently. You can switch from lead to lead very easily. Say, for example, [PERSON-2] said maybe 10 on any given day.
Agent: Maybe you are contacting all of these people on any given day. That would not be surprising by any way, shape. form.
Agent: So this is where we could bring up columns of the most recent activity, help you easily sor t through those. It truly doesn't become overwhelming when you're doing it because it's what the platfor m is designed to do.
Agent: But it's a combination of tools if that's helpful.
Agent: Does that answer you r question [PERSON-2] ?
Agent: Yes, thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 10: And then if someone were to call in, you click on the search bar, type their name in, pop it up, and then you bring out this record right here and automatically work from it.
Agent: Yeah, it's amazing how in practicality that, you know, an interpre-university search bar gets used quite frequently because it helps you find everything immediately.
Agent: So anything that pops up on the fly, most folks are popping there very quickly, and then going to their task lists and their lead lists. And basically with those three things, you have everything.
Agent: So the last component I want to touch on after the actual overall process of handling the lead and taking a declosure, say this, you know, [PERSON-26] here does actually end up closing a lease with.
Agent: The [ORG-1] team for that specific event. Now let's take a look at how dashboard and reporting works. This is more for an executive and or manager. We're looking at the overall organization as a whole.
Agent: Like I mentioned in the beginning, you can take a look at The dashboards and these are all created based off of reports.
Agent: So this is more holistic to the organization looking at all the executed leases based on the goals that we had for [DATE-11].
Agent: And you can set up, you could set up to however, distinction that you might want in terms of the viewability as well as the filtering of it.
Agent: Looking at, again, leasing pipelines, the activity per rep, as well as the leaderboard for the reps as well. And additional reports can all be done.
Agent: Done based on what makes the most sense for understanding that outcome for each individua l rep, right ?
Agent: The dashboards report and showcase like what that report looks like. Right now the report will look like. See you soon.
Agent: Something similar to this is just like an [PRODUCT-1] output, essentially, of all the information. I can actually edit it very easily.
Agent: I can create a new report if I wanted to, but I wanted to show you a case how easy it is to create as well as edit the report.
Agent: It's fairly similar to what you would typically do with a pivot table in [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: You can add columns, rows, as well as filter. And so very easy to run that report and then add a chart and showcase exactly what the type of information you want is. And so...
Agent: So again, all this information is based off what's stored within [ORG-2], and that' s kind of how you're able to take advantage of the analytics as well as the data tha t you currently have for your business .
EndUser: So I'm assuming that there would be a way. So right now we use terms to kind of indicate where we think a deal is going to land. So we have executed, obviously that's a deal that's already secured.
EndUser: We have perspective, which is a deal that we're [PERCENT-1], sure is going to happen, or it's an upcoming renewal that we're comfortable will happen.
EndUser: And then we have perspective, which is, I don't know who I'm going to lease to, but I need to lease to someone to meet my budget. And that's... my that's that the speculative.
EndUser: So is there a way to kind of build that into the reporting so that we can kind of see
Agent: Yeah, so anything that you would want from a particular like record type. So what I'm showing you is a record.
Agent: We can do like different types of it as well as different fields for categorization, as well as this path that you have.
Agent: I think it really depends on the like scoping exactly what you need, right?
Agent: But overall, it's very, it's all very doable.
Agent: It's more so just like figure out, hey, what's the best Workflow for you in terms of having all that stored in one location, as well as where do you will want the user to kind of keep their eye on in terms o f being able to see where the priority is or where the stage is or where the status is for each individual piece.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Yeah, I was just going to add [PERSON-2], the short answer there is yes, for sure.
Agent: You're kind of referencing two different pieces ones or, you know, the type of deal that it is, but then two is the stage that the deal is in.
Agent: And those are by far the two most common ways that people report and check what's in their pipeline. So, you know, prospective deals of this type, boom, here's my list real fast.
Agent: So that's part of the upfront configuration that we would do with you throughout all of this is get the sequencing of how your deal stages flow basically and then connect those really tightly to the types.
Agent: And then you can find, you know, any specific.
Agent: Deal type that happens to be in that stage and you can filter on and find the information that yo u need and then you can work it or you can decide how much of a priority is or how likely it is o r adjust that type of thing .
EndUser: Perfect, thanks.
Agent: I know we have about, I believe, [TIME-3] left, right?
Agent: True. I wanted to make sure that we had some time left over.
Agent: Is there any questions as far?
Agent: Outside of what it was asked already. There's one last thing that didn't want to showcase really quick, and that's the ability to use everything or do everything that you saw on the app within the phone.
Agent: So it's mobile accessible. So everything that we were talking about in terms of the emails that have existed with [PERSON-10] and [PERSON-26], all that information is readily available in the application itself. I can do it on the go.
Agent: I can actually post in chatter. on top, I can add tasks, I can comment I can change the record itself . I can do all that within the mobile application. So I could do all that on the go.
Agent: So say I'm on site, I had a meeting, and I actually have to log that information. I want to store it somewhere. I can do it on my phone. So I want to touch on that.
Agent: I'll be back, too.
Agent: Now just add real quick [PERSON-5].
Agent: This is probably a good time to call out to a lot of folks then connect like a business card scanner or something like that so that you can actually then just natively cool give that a quick scan, then updates and creates either a new contact or creates whatever you wanted to create.
Agent: We see a lot of folks use that from the mobile setup as well just because you're walking around with it. As you meet people, you get handed a card, you can use your phone.
Agent: Absolutely.
EndUser: This also helps from an adoption standpoint, which I know is something that we discuss that it has to be adopted and it has to have ease of use.
EndUser: So that really helps combat any callouts with I was on site. I was walking them all. I'm going to sit down and log everything.
EndUser: It's all there for you live ready to go on our phones, which we live on already. So I found that that's been extremely helpful.
EndUser: Getting teams to log their things, use it effectively and really get the ROI that you're seeking.
Agent: Alrighty. And that's mainly what I wanted to showcase [DATE-1]. That pretty much ends the demonstration that we have.
Agent: Are there any questions that you might have for us right now before I hand it back to [PERSON-10]?
EndUser: I'm assuming we can, there's a way, like
Agent: If someone goes to our websites and fills out an application that could automatically feed into [ORG-2]. Yeah, absolutely. So I, again, didn't want to go that in depth in terms of what complications we can actually scope out.
Agent: [PERSON-8] and team can definitely help you with that, right?
Agent: We can do something as simple as, hey, there's a form fill on your site. That information that you fill into the form goes directly in the [ORG-2] is populated as a prospect or lead.
Agent: All that information is stored there. You can get as complicated as say, hey, I want to actually have an application on our site available to users to apply.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Like you can do all of that based on it just really depends on how you want to kind of approach it.
Agent: We would probably suggest like phasing it out to see like, hey, what's the easiest way to handle it right now. Maybe there's a face to face three later on, depending on how you want to structure.
Agent: You're onboarding as well as your change management. So.
EndUser: Does that help [PERSON-2]. Yes, thank you.
EndUser: Right. So I'm going to like our ability to, um, you know, send emails to say, like all the leads that are of a certain status or something like that.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: So we Yeah, you can do large, you could do like, you know, send email to all, right?
Agent: So we could definitely do like a list, a send list email to everybody. And it can be modified based on the macro within the email. So it'll take like the username specifically.
Agent: And then it'll be personalized to those individuals. If this is more of like a one on one off like engagement, if you're talking about more like mass communications and consistent journeys that you're going to put these individuals on.
Agent: We might talk to like say how you're doing marketing now, how can you kind of be more specific in terms of figuring out how the journey for that user should be But if you're just looking for like a one off hand, I want to engage in all of them and one go.
Agent: Yeah, I can easily send what is called list email . find a list, send all of them the same email, essentially, with personalized to their information.
Speaker 10: Does that one thing I do want to call out on this as well?
Speaker 10: So one of the filtering capabilities that we showed was at an [EVENT-1], was it Holiday?
Speaker 10: What are they here for?
Speaker 10: So you could filter based on [DATE-10].
Speaker 10: So if you're coming up on [DATE-19], it's [DATE-11], you want to make sure all your holiday contacts are You reach out to all your people that have had interests in having a holiday specialty leasing space within some of your malls, you can that rep can filter by that and add them to their own little personal campaign, then call it the holiday campaign, whatever they want it to be, and send emails via that route as well so you can filter based on a specific group of individuals within [ORG-2].
Speaker 10: And then add them to campaigns. It's one they'll manage themselves. So the Messaging and obviously you want it to be [ORG-1] approved messaging, but it's Messaging that they'll go about that way.
Speaker 10: It's not necessarily like corporate marketing, if that makes sense. Yeah.
EndUser: But. So that's that added campaign button up there that you could use. Through you do have the ability to kind of create marketing campaigns.
EndUser: So if we wanted to do that, could we?
Agent: Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely.
Agent: [PERSON-2], are you using anything for marking right now?
EndUser: I mean, to a degree, but again, a lot of our stuff is so manual. We have postcards that we hand out. We have all sorts of things that would be so much better if it was, you know, digital.
Agent: Yeah, and so there's definitely like more details that we could go into in terms of scoping that need, right?
Agent: For all intents and purposes, we can do everything.
Agent: Now it's more so dependent on like to what scale and what complication you want it to be, right?
Agent: There might be a need for our marketing solution, but based on what you're asking right now, like if you're just doing standard email and adding them to campaigns, you could very much do it with a core platform itself.
Agent: And again, I can let [PERSON-8] speak to it, but like it might be like a, once you understand like, and figure out how you're gonna use the platform now, you wanna take it the next step and advance the way you're handling your marketing, you can do that as well with the [ORG-2] platform.
Agent: Yeah, I would just add that I think [PERSON-2], a lot of folks coming from, you know, the solutions that you're on now would start with, you know, here's the, the basics six campaigns we would do throughout [DATE-19], something for everybody who does a pop up for [DATE-14], people who come in and do something for [DATE-10], people who are in for [DATE-23] for the carnivals we see in the parking lot, but you know pick all of those types of things that you can create standard Messaging to send out about it but then also to your point whether it's a postcard or a greeting or something like that, you could do campaigns to send that same consistent positive community-based Messaging as well.
Agent: So, think of it as pick the scenarios and then we ca n kind of orient it around that .
EndUser: And so I'm going to keep in mind there is that it will automatically, this might go without saying, but I just want to be as detailed as possible.
EndUser: It will then track all of that activity onto each individual contact.
EndUser: So you can see, did this person get an email from the campaign?
EndUser: And that can be something that you start baking into your analytics. You can pull reports on it.
EndUser: What did this campaign do for us?
EndUser: What kind of responses did we get?
EndUser: And that's all within the core platform. So it's not just that it can send the email. It then can also track how that email helped your organization.
EndUser: Afterwards, what kind of impact did it have?
EndUser: So that's something that is, hopefully, I think i s really relevant and important to note .
Speaker 10: Yeah, definitely. Very important. Thank you. Yeah, you can create templates and send an email to your employees saying, hey, holiday season is right around the corner.
Speaker 10: Use this template to contact your previous tenants that had interest in working with us over [DATE-7]. And then it's a template that you all have created. They click it, add the list to it and click send.
Speaker 10: Yeah, there you go.
EndUser: And this allows for quite a lot of records. You can see at the bottom it says send limits. So it gives you a lot of [PERSON-25] run without having to add anything extra.
Speaker 10: Perfect. Well, just a few more things to go over. I guess we'll pause real quick.
Speaker 10: Any questions as it relates to that?
Speaker 10: What we've discussed so far?
Speaker 10: Alrighty. So let me share my screen here.
Speaker 10: So a couple of things I wanted to touch on as I believe [PERSON-8] mentioned Like there is ways to add business card scanners to your mobile app. So [ORG-2] has an app exchange.
Speaker 10: Think of it much like the app store on your iPhone or [ORG-7]. If you have an Android device, you can just come up here and search. You can see my recent search, but business card scanner.
Speaker 10: And then it'll pop up. You can sort by ratings. You can sort by business needs, but vision, scan business card events. It's free. Just add it to your environment like that.
Speaker 10: So the only good thing about [ORG-2] is we're open API. Anybody that wants to work with us can work with us. Now we have a heavily vetting process for you to get on our app exchange.
Speaker 10: You can't just upload an app. Everything that is up there has been tested and approved by [ORG-2]. But this is something neat that you'll have in your back pocket too.
Speaker 10: And then the other thing I wanted to touch on is trailhead. [ORG-8] is a great learning environment, whether it be for new hires, whether it's for y'all, as you get up to speed, should you choose our solution.
Speaker 10: But it is literally a playground way of learning more about [ORG-2]. So if you can come up here and say, OK, how to create a sales report. Search for it.
Speaker 10: If my internet will work.
Speaker 10: There we go. And this will give you multiple different ways to learn about how to remake a port in [ORG-2]. So create report and dashboards for sales and marketing managers.
Speaker 10: You click into it and then you go through it. And after this, you'll be able to create reports and dashboards. And one thing I want to call out, this is completely free for anybody to use.
Speaker 10: And you can create your own trails, what we call them, which is a series of learnings, which is what this is.
Speaker 10: That way, if you have a new hire, you can say how to get started with [ORG-2] and just show specific things that you've curated or that you work with [PERSON-23] to help curate in one of these trails or projects.
Speaker 10: That way your new hires will be up to speed very quickly and be able to use the platform.
EndUser: So we can customize those by person or position. assign them out, schedule them throughout [DATE-19] as an example.
Speaker 10: You can't schedule them through within the platform. So this is separate from being within [ORG-2].
Speaker 10: Now you can send out like a company mandate and say, you need to have these trails done by X date and you can include the trail or project like this. You just copy the link and send it out.
Speaker 10: All you have to do to access any of this is just create a login.
EndUser: Thank you.
Speaker 10: Absolutely. All right, so let's jump back in the slide show here. To give you a quick example as well, like we use trails internally at [ORG-2] very often. So say I'm looking at, you know, we have regular security.
Agent: Trails that we have to do for any update in terms of our security processes and any like, you know, um, any type of learnings we use them internally as well.
Agent: So you could definitely use that as Part of your process how we train at [ORG-2]
EndUser: And we are right in salesforce just really quickly so we're not internal salesforce and we use them as well and they're great so
EndUser: Thank you
Speaker 10: So one thing I did want to touch on as it relates to sales force is We're really at the tip of the iceberg as far as it relates to what [ORG-2] can do to [ORG-1] properties.
Speaker 10: Everything we focused on here is this area right here. I'm not sure if you can see my mouse cursor, but deal in leasing management. There's so much more that [ORG-2] can do as a platform for your company.
Speaker 10: We wanted to be targeted and focus in on the use case here. But as you should you get started with [ORG-2], there's a whole other capability. It's like a complete target and reengage tenant section.
Speaker 10: This is our marketing side. It can be as in depth or as simple as you'd like it to be. Tenant and guest servicing from a servicing perspective. We have a whole area around that.
Speaker 10: Whether the integration, investment management, deal pipeline, sustainability, and ESG. There is a whole we call it the real estate 331 or customer 331. As you'll hear it kind of more generically announced from [ORG-2]. But.
Speaker 10: Your whole platform can be transitioned to [ORG-2].
Speaker 10: Should you choose?
Speaker 10: Should you want to just stick to deal and leasing management?
Speaker 10: That's completely fine. We're really just talking about the typically iceberg on how [ORG-2] can help [ORG-9].
Speaker 10: And to provide a little color on that, I'll turn that over to the [NORP-1] team on really what the long-term possibilities look like with [ORG-2].
Agent: Yeah, I just want to briefly kind of highlight this.
Agent: You know, I mean, as [PERSON-10] called out so many folks in real estate come to the sales force platform for that idea of, oh, I need a basic [PRODUCT-3] and I need to manage my leasing processes.
Agent: I would say it quickly becomes evident during some of the early scoping discussions that, oh, it can handle a lot that happens before leasing happens. And it can handle a lot that happens after leasing happens.
Agent: You know, one of the biggest questions we do during scoping is what as we're figuring out your entire deal lifecycle, people start to realize that. executed lease is really not the end of the deal.
Agent: It moves into the move-in process the property management process, which quickly moves into how do we interact with the tenan t long-term?
Agent: Maybe it's via a portal, and then suddenly we're doing service with tha t user as they can input some of that in the portal, and then that can interact wit h our property management group.
Agent: And then suddenly we have property management groups calling hey, can we start to track some of the asset data within there?
Agent: And the answer is yes And then even in the opposite direction, it's, yeah, we have leads coming in, but can we go bac k further?
Agent: A lot of the questions that came up [DATE-1] on that marketing side.
Agent: So, you know, what I put in front of you is just a call out that we spent a l ot of time talking in that top left hand corner.
Agent: But there really is the ability to cross t he entire lifecycle here, whether it's enhancing the leasing process itself, where a lot of folks create, you know, auto create documents for leases to speed themselves up.
Agent: They [PERSON-28] rt doing more automation in terms of rent schedules or commissions with outside brokers. Or, y ou know, [PERSON-2], as we talked about earlier, really automating the deal review process.
Agent: I've se en some grou p. that their deal review committees, they actually pull up a report in [ORG-2] and go through th at, which is very cool, because you see that data live.
Agent: And then just kind of touching on the bot [PERSON-38] is a big one that's become popular recently is folks are executing more and more complex leases or contracts on all types of leasing, and those move-in dates are becoming way more popular.
Agent: We're seeing lots of groups.
Agent: How can I project manage with tenant coordination, the move-in process or the move-out process and making sure that we actually adhere to the details of the lease?
Agent: Again, I won't drain every single detail here, but at least just wanted to talk about a bit of the art of the possible of how [ORG-2] can really become that operating platform holistically long-term.
Agent: You're starting exactly where you should though with leasing and the basics and keeping. it simple. We see it as a journey of adding these pieces on over time as it makes sense .
EndUser: Any questions there?
EndUser: I know a lot of information there.
EndUser: [PERSON-8], when you were talking about the piece of, you know, after the deal is signed, there are so many more steps to bring the deal to fruition and see it to its end.
EndUser: And whether they renew or they depart. All those steps over [DATE-20] or [DATE-26]. What section would that be in because it sounds like it would not be a capability within the area that we have been reviewing.
Agent: No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, it depends on exactly what you want. So for example, if it's a basic prompting for a lease renewal, that's super basic. Least gets executed.
Agent: We pull out the details of it, the details of that come back, and you store those within [ORG-2] as lease data, if you will. You could set up auto renewals. You could set up contacts.
Agent: All of that would be fairly basic setup that would be within the scope. More what I was just getting at is adding complexities and more cross-functional usage to the platform.
Agent: So for example, you would probably start with just your leasing teams in here to really get that cross functional platform You'd have to pull in property managers.
Agent: You'd have to pull in other marketing folks and get them access as well So it's not necessarily a limitation of functionality, more of a limitation of who has cross functional access to the system of that makes sense .
Agent: Was that helpful for your question?
EndUser: Oh, yes. Thank you.
Agent: The other piece I would call out though is, you know, some folks do start managing those dates within their anyways, even without, you know, giving access to property managers, there's things like that, as long as you have a point of contact with access who can manage those dates and push things forward.
Agent: We definitely encourage folks to think about it holistically, otherwise you're calling us in [DATE-26] and saying no one's abiding by the terms of my lease. Well, it's because we're not actually tracking them.
Agent: And it's typically a manifestation of a current problem as well, but you're just, you're able to actually see it way more quickly because of the system in front of you.
EndUser: So in our case here at [ORG-1], we execute our leases in our ERP, [PERSON-23]. What kind of integrations are interfaces
Agent: Do we have with [ORG-2] available [DATE-1], if any?
Agent: Oh, quite a few. We have built a lot of integrations with [ORG-10] during our career. That is obviously the most popular with [ORG-13]. We also do them with MRI, [PERSON-30].
Agent: Some folks do some really cool workflows where you generate the lease via [ORG-2], basically.
Agent: And then once it's actually inked and executed, you could run it through an abstraction software that then puts it in [ORG-10] and then we can integrate it back. Long story short, lots of possibilities with integrating into [ORG-2].
Agent: We know that a lot of the niche real estate tools like YARDI are not always super friendly.
Agent: In terms of integrating, but that's something that we've built a lot of perspective on And so depending upon how, I guess we'll even take a step back we know that not all yardy instances are created the same So based upon how your setup is actually set up we have some perspective on how to do that the best .
EndUser: And I'm guessing that also maybe includes ability to bring in data from [ORG-11] as far as I think I saw a screen earlier where we had the property details with the units and all that stuff.
EndUser: And does it also includes like things like that may enable us to synchronize our unit data that is in [ORG-11] with what we would find in self as well.
Agent: Yep, you got it. And so, you know, some of that is, we'll end up having some discussions of what exactly is your source of truth for certain pieces of data.
Agent: And then we can set up the integration so that they are making sure that they're actually synced across. So things like accounts, contact information, lease data, things like that, we actually make sure that it integrates through.
Agent: At least that's what we typically say.
EndUser: Sounds good.
Agent: Any other questions there?
Agent: I would just say the long story short here is that there's a lot of possibility in terms of taking on the holistic life cycle, but truly just honing in on, you know, deal workflows from a specialty and a perm standpoint a [PRODUCT-3] standpoint is huge in terms of pulling the organization together and creating some operational efficiencies.
Agent: I don't want to get off my numbers.
Agent: The one thing that I also wanted to note as well is that with [ORG-2], you have ownership of the platform.
Agent: So everything that I mentioned in terms of configuration as well as changes, that can be done within the platform itself and you own it, right?
Agent: So you can make it however you want. You don't need to come to us to make changes granted. You know, we have best practices and [PERSON-8] and team as well as us.
Agent: We can make those suggestions and we can help within it, like building specific components, but you don't have to come to us to make changes. And I think that's a big component as well.
Agent: But I'll hand it back to [PERSON-10] to talk about scheduling and the rest of it . Sure.
Speaker 10: Absolutely. Yeah, one of the best things about [ORG-2] is it can be customized to fit your business. You don't have to make your business fit your platform.
Speaker 10: So we always like to kind of point that out that whatever unique use cases you have, we've probably seen it before and we have a solution for it. So. We appreciate your time.
Speaker 10: I know we're [TIME-4] over right now. So thank you.
Speaker 10: This is just a little bit of a joint success plan that we put together here care and we can work backwards with you on this to fill it out.
Speaker 10: Should we continue and move forward, but we've already knocked out five of the items on here so that really concludes what we had planned for you [DATE-1]. So thank you very much.
Speaker 10: We'll send this presentation out as well as the Recording that way you have it. But.
Speaker 10: Any initial feedback or thoughts as it relates to what we presented [DATE-1]?
EndUser: No, I mean, I feel like we've pretty much covered the bases. No. Looks good.
Speaker 10: Was there anything that we didn't touch on [DATE-1] that you might want to see separately?
EndUser: I mean, I'll go through the list one more time, you know, in preparation for another round.
EndUser: We'll go through and just make sure, you know, because we're going to want to kind of retouch on all of those actual requirements anyway. So, but no, nothing off the top of my head that we didn't hit.
Speaker 10: Sounds great. Well, thank y'all very much for your time. [PERSON-23], I'll sync with you just separately after this. We can figure out, I know that you're going to see another demonstration of this.
Speaker 10: Just a little feedback from what we did [DATE-1]. That was part of what we had as a feedback, and then we'll work on scheduling the second round.
EndUser: Sounds good. Thanks, y'all.
Speaker 10: All righty. Thank you so much. We appreciate your time. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. [PERSON-38].",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of the seller's product to help manage leads and opportunities, as well as its ability to automate workflows and approvals. They also appreciated the customization options and the potential for the platform to handle the entire lifecycle of a deal, from lead generation to post-lease management. The customer was particularly interested in the ability to track and manage unit data, as well as the potential for integrations with their existing systems, such as [ORG-10], [PERSON-30], and [ORG-11]. They also mentioned the ease of use and the potential for the platform to improve operational efficiencies.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a comprehensive demonstration of the product and addressed many features that could potentially be useful for the customer. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. When discussing the core values of their organization, the sales rep mentioned sustainability and how it aligns with the customer's website. The rep could have asked more questions to understand the customer's specific sustainability goals and initiatives, and how their product could support those efforts.

2. During the demonstration, the sales rep briefly mentioned the ability to customize the fields and values for leads. The rep could have asked the customer about their current lead tracking process and what specific data points they would like to capture in the system. This would have allowed the rep to tailor the demonstration to better fit the customer's needs.

3. When discussing the approval process, the sales rep mentioned that it could be customized to fit the customer's specific workflow. The rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current approval process and any pain points they experience. This would have allowed the rep to demonstrate how the product could streamline and improve this process.

4. Towards the end of the call, the sales rep briefly mentioned the ability to integrate with the customer's ERP system and bring in data from other sources. The rep could have asked more questions about the customer's current data sources and how they would like to see that data integrated into the system. This would have allowed the rep to demonstrate the full capabilities of the product and how it could be customized to fit the customer's specific needs.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. However, they did not express any major concerns or objections during the demonstration and asked clarifying questions to better understand the product's capabilities. They also mentioned that the product seems to align with their needs and use cases. Therefore, it can be inferred that the customer may have a positive view of the product's ability to meet their needs, but a definitive answer cannot be given without further information.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions were aimed at understanding the customer's needs, processes, and technical requirements. Here are some examples:

1. ""We've spent a good amount of time with [PERSON-1] and a few others on the team, really giving us an overview of the use case for [ORG-2] at [ORG-1] properties, some of the technical requirements. [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] were fantastic at [LAW-1] as kind of figuring out your current processes as they relate [DATE-1].""

2. ""So [PERSON-10], you know, we partner with [ORG-2] across the board, but we really specialize in partnering with real estate. And my background has been, you know, spending my career consulting and working in industry for a few different firms, worked at [GPE-2] retail for [DATE-4]. So very intubally familiar with retail malls and how we can help with the leasing processes. I'm excited to be here [DATE-1].""

3. ""So one of the things we always like to discuss first when talking about [ORG-2] is our core values, is they really guide everything we do. In top of the list is trust, right? It's our number one value. And it really means that we act with transparency and lead with our ethics.""

4. ""So I know [ORG-2] might be new to several of you that are on the call [DATE-1]. So one of the things we always like to discuss first when talking about [ORG-2] is our core values, is they really guide everything we do.""

5. ""So what I'm seeing right in front on the left hand side, you see this leasing dashboard is for individual reps. This is for [PERSON-10] specifically. These are all dashboards that are created based off reports. And that report those reports. I'll go into more detail on how you can edit and create the m. off of information that's existent within [ORG-2] platform.""

These questions and statements show that the sales rep is trying to understand the customer's needs and processes, and is positioning [ORG-2] as a solution that can help meet those needs.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the top concerns the customer had about the seller's product.,What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question about the opportunity to create consistency for new hires and help with process training by creating links out to document repositories, checklists, and other resources within the platform. The customer responded positively, indicating that they loved the idea and found it helpful for turnover.
2. Question about the ability to determine the source of a lead and customize the fields accordingly. The customer confirmed that this was possible and noted that everything in the platform was configurable.
3. Question about the possibility of engaging with marketing campaigns and storing that information within the platform. The customer expressed interest in this feature and its potential to help teams collaborate better.

In each of these instances, the sales rep asked questions that resonated with the customer's needs and interests, leading to a more engaged response.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They expressed that the presentation covered the bases and they had no major concerns or unanswered questions. They also mentioned that they would like to go through the list of requirements again in preparation for another round of discussions. Overall, they seemed interested in continuing the conversation and moving forward with the deal.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the correct decision maker was present on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call."
video_19787_167_6qr3y000000kA1pAAE,"Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: No problem.
Agent: And as you may have noticed, we also switched over to Zoom. So hopefully everybody's having a better experience on that as far as getting in.
Agent: Any other comments?
Agent: Did you need us to do Zoom for the demo on [DATE-1], [PERSON-1]?
Agent: You guys took control of the [PRODUCT-1]. The only challenge we typically have doing the [PRODUCT-2] is that with Teams,
Agent: Okay, because I can switch it to zoom, you know, we still have time if you want me to do that, whatever is easier for you guys, because if you want to zoom for whatever reason, be easier for you guys to send stuff to us because when we were doing all of those extensive workshops before with affinity,
Agent: You guys had trouble sharing them with us on our side from Why I think it's weird. Yeah, I'm on the [PERSON-2] SharePoint and then we can get in. So zoom that works better.
Agent: Well, send me a Zoom meeting and then I'll propagate it to the attendees. And there's going to be a few more attending on [DATE-1] too. Few more executives, just FYI for everybody.
Agent: Yeah, that's great. Okay. Anybody else within the updates before we just kind of go through the flow here.
Agent: And [PERSON-1], I can let you run slides if you want. I just wasn't sure. So I brought them up.
Agent: It's okay [PERSON-3] I mean you can just hit him and go through him as well so. We obviously put the forward looking statement in here because publicly chair and company were obligated to do that next slide [PERSON-3].
Agent: So as we typically do in [ORG-1], we'll start off with a thank you for the time. Thank you for the opportunity to be considered and then I'm going to transition right into kind of the,
Agent: Six of us, I think, in the room. And then I also wanted to take a little bit of time since it may be new to people that, you know, the three key companies that are there to help.
Agent: Ensure a successful Implementation if you select this for [ORG-2]. And that would be obviously [PERSON-4] and the team from [ORG-3], [PERSON-5] and the team from [ORG-4]. And then obviously [ORG-1] as the platform.
Agent: And then we're going to transition from that into kind of an executive overview where [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-4] will go over some of our point of view and what we believe is relevant to our expertise and capabilities for brokers like yourself to consider.
Agent: And then review some of the key top validations that we've talked about related to the transformation Then we'll get right into the demonstration. We'll encourage Q&A throughout [DATE-2].
Agent: If people are willing to do that, that would be great. And then just talk about next steps as far as coming out of it. So that's the structure of the presentation in the demo .
Agent: Then I'll go right into the slide to introduce the people. Again, these people will all be there in person for the presentation. And everybody knows everybody on this slide, but I'll introduce them when we get through it.
Agent: And then I'll segue from the people to the companies and why that's relevant.
Agent: [PERSON-4] will give a little bit of a background on [ORG-3], why we chose to make sure that they were part of it because when you specifically asked us about really getting our best talented people around really knowing [ORG-5].
Agent: [PERSON-7]'s and [PERSON-4]'s team really bring a lot of that strength and expertise They really know [ORG-6]'s inside and out and I know that was a big challenge For [PERSON-8], obviously, [PERSON-9] and the good work that they delivered already with th e [ORG-7] bring a lot of that [ORG-1] industry expertise and skill set to the table And then we believe the platform from [ORG-1] is the best possible solution .
Agent: For [ORG-2]. So together the three of us feel very confident that we can deliver a very successful outcome in the shortest possible time to meet the needs of your RDS and beyond. So the next slide.
Agent: This is just kind of a visual to make sure that people understand everything that's out there within the [ORG-1] platform. And so what's highlighted in red is the basically the force.com platform, which is our foundational layer.
Agent: We actually call it hyper force now. And that's what some of our partners like [PERSON-10] day at choose to leverage as their base foundation. And then they put their custom managed package on top.
Agent: Of that force.com platform, you, [PERSON-11], have traditionally leveraged everything in th e Sales Cloud and Service Cloud layer that's highlighted there in green.
Agent: But recently with the las t contract that we just executed in [DATE-3], we were able to give you all of the rights and [GPE-1] e capabilities for everything that's in [ORG-8] in the blue column.
Agent: And so now that' s all available to everybody within the organization,
Agent: Than you had before.
Agent: So the visual here is that as you continue to go up the stack you don't lose anything you just continue to gain capabilities and a lot of the things th at we're going to be showing you [PERSON-9]: And I wanted to kind of set the foundation that [ORG-9] has been out there since [DATE-4].
Agent: We do three major releases [DATE-5] and why that's relevant to you is all of that Innovation that we keep bringing to the table.
Agent: Like a lot of the Innovation that we acquired when we bought [NORP-1] and [GPE-2] and Velocity, which is specifically the insurance footprint where velocity was acquired [DATE-6] now and then moved into the core platform as well.
Agent: It's no longer a managed package.
Agent: It's being moved into all of the core platform, then the [ORG-10] acquisition obviously that you probably heard about And as we continue to roll out more AI and Data Cloud capabilities, all of that will be release d in those three major releases that we do but dedicated specifically for those insurance capabilitie s as well as banking and wealth And if you looked at [ORG-11] , It's a separate business, which we don't report, but it's literally over [MONEY-1] a year run rate business.
Agent: And that would be probably one of the closest to the top 10 software companies in the world just by itself.
Agent: In addition to all the stuff we've been doing with [ORG-9], we've also been recognized by several industry people.
Agent: So this is an IDC report that we just recently got the rights to publish and share with customers, but basically it positions [ORG-1] as a leader for digital experience platforms, specifically in the insurance industry.
Agent: And we're very excited about this recognition and award because it really validates a lot of the work that we've been doing since [DATE-4] with [ORG-9].
Agent: [ORG-11] cloud and the platform and being recognized by such a large industr y entity like [ORG-9] is we're very proud of that. So next slide please .
Agent: [ORG-9] also has recognized sales force and specifically around some of the things that we're doing in insurance. So that's another recognition from a well regarded industry analyst firm.
Agent: And that's another one two keep in mind as you continue to make your decision. And then there's also one more that I wanted to share because it's really relevant to [ORG-5] specifically.
Agent: This is the recognition from [ORG-10], where we received an award for digital and emerging technologies for the work that we did with N2G, which is an [ORG-5] in the commercial lines area, which is a partnership between nationwide and generally.
Agent: They're growing very rapidly and they leverage [ORG-1] to dramatically improve their business. And we have a detailed case study that.
Agent: I can share with you guys now, but also offer to share it with a lot of larger audience on [DATE-1] But that case study has a lot of really good information, particularly as it relates to some of the key themes on the next slide .
Agent: And so not only were they recognized for the digital and emerging technologies, but the speed at which they were able to do it was very impressive.
Agent: So from start to finish, they were able to get into production in [DATE-7].
Agent: You can see on the right, they ultimately ended up rolling out five global product launches and they're continuing to roll out more and more capabilities.
Agent: But it's been a very successful Implementation into G, and it was speaking at [ORG-17].
Agent: And continues to be a real [ORG-17] story for us And I thought that was very relevant considering th e parallels between them and [ORG-2] So I wanted to share that with you And again, I'll share the case study .
Agent: Next slide.
Agent: The last point that I wanted to bring up is because there were some contracts that we were able to put in place that are relevant to [ORG-2] because of the contract that we put in place for affinity, as well as the large [DATE-8] renewal that we did.
Agent: The good news is, is all of the price protections are in place [DATE-9] already all of those contracts are in place, and different LOBs like [ORG-2] are able to buy off of those contracts in those price tables that are already.
Agent: Existing that your procurement organization did a really good job of putting that structure in place And I will also share that as you buy more, we have tiered discounts.
Agent: So the discounts ge t better as you continue to buy more.
Agent: So that was the last slide that I had, but I did want to leave you with th e with the information that from a contractual standpoint, we already have these vehicles in place, and you could just order against those existing contracts if you choose to move forward with us, which we certainly hope you do.
EndUser: So at that point, I would transition then to [PERSON-6], and so [PERSON-6]. [PERSON-1], [PERSON-9] here. So a question that could be asked, what's been negotiated recently with [PERSON-2].
EndUser: So are the discounts holistic, meaning all the divisions combined or per division?
EndUser: How does that work?
EndUser: Because [PERSON-10] might not know that. And just for clarity for everybody, [PERSON-10] has a merger partner meeting on this time [DATE-1]. We didn't want to reschedule because we don't want to slow this down.
EndUser: The decision is pretty close here on being made in [DATE-10] or so is what we think. So [PERSON-17] will be on the call, but we'll.
EndUser: Will have other heavy hitters there as well that would help influence the decision So just wanted to make sure everybody knew that because there's not going to be a lo t of people beyond [PERSON-17] and I in the room on [DATE-1] Some of them will be on the call.
EndUser: So I just want to be clear on that. So everybody understood expectations .
Agent: So, you know, we were obviously hoping to get face time with [PERSON-10]. So that's a little disappointing, but I understand the conflict. So we'll, we'll just continue to do that.
EndUser: You know, our goal is not only to do this presentation, but come back and do the executive readout. So, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll have you meet [PERSON-10] in a different time.
EndUser: He apologized, but he just pinged me [DATE-11]. That's, that's the messages you got from [GPE-3] [DATE-11], [PERSON-1].
Agent: Got it. So I'll be sure to emphasize that. Thanks for that update. I'll be sure to put that in my talk track.
Agent: But yes, any business unit, anybody at [PERSON-2], these contracts are in place for the entire corporation to take advantage of. And the reason why that's really relevant.
Agent: I mean, [PERSON-17], this goes back to the, you know, the thumb in the air kind of deals where people were trying to figure out what would [ORG-1] cost if we did this at [ORG-2].
Agent: And the good news is, is We don't have to guess anymore I mean, the contracts in place, the price holds are in place and they're pretty aggressive discounts So [PERSON-10] and his team can take advantage of all of those <inaudible> e concessions that are in place [DATE-9] And those contracts are in force at least the major [PERSON-17] r renewals in place until, I think, [DATE-9] S o
Agent: Anyhow, we've got contracts taken care of. I'll make sure I include that in my talk. So in that good Interaction back to you, thanks.
Agent: I was just, that's kind of the flow for me to go for it from there.
Agent: And then at this point, this is when I would turn it over to [PERSON-6], you know, and then that one slide that I have with the three bubbles, [PERSON-4]'s going to add some color commentary there.
Agent: And [PERSON-5]'s going to add some color commentary to kind of give their, you know, elevator pitch on who's, who's [ORG-3] and who's, who's gerant for the people in the room that don't know.
Agent: And so then at this point, I would transition to [PERSON-6] and she's going to.
Agent: Kind of go over what we're doing for brokers and so forth . [PERSON-6], don't let me talk for you . go ahead and.. . yeah, no worries .
Agent: I want to make sure that this is right-size d for the audience . I was thinking.. .
Agent: To start with what our overall vision is and let everyone in the room know that we are planning a Tier 1 product launch at [ORG-17] on what we're calling insurance brokerage, which in essence is an [ORG-17] replacement.
Agent: We have a, you know, development is full speed ahead right now and we've got a lot of excitement in the market.
Agent: We also have some very excited design partners of which of course we'd love to invite anyone within [PERSON-2] to join if they're so interested.
Agent: But this would be our overall vision really to break down these silos and create a holistic view of your business across any lines of business in a way so that you can action on it and know what you're doing.
Agent: Go to the next slide, please. This goes into more specifics on the investment areas, including agency management foundations, commissions, especially specialization for lines of business.
Agent: I will be able to touch on [PERSON-21] at this point and explain, yeah, there's, there's two sites to the [PERSON-21] integrations.
Agent: There's the sending data from a carrier into [PERSON-21] and then being able to download it from [PERSON-21] into an [ORG-21]. We've been able to successfully work with applied to show the.
Agent: We have several anecdotal evidence, if you will, that it's not hard to take that data and ingest it back into sales force .
Agent: Applied, however, has not been as excited to do a proof of concept with us on that direction, primarily because they see us as a competitor to [ORG-14].
Agent: So we do have, we have talked with [PERSON-4] and team about their, what that would have to be in the scope of work is to be able to write that Integration to take your batch downloads from [PERSON-14]'s and put it back into [ORG-9].
Agent: And I'm assuming since your [PERSON-2] you'll be able to get those downloads as part of your [PERSON-14] subscription.
EndUser: Well, we need to download not the upload. So, yeah.
Agent: So you would be able, I mean, you would just need access to that batch data from [PERSON-21], which is what you pay for as that subscription.
Agent: And then we would have to write an Integration to send it back into [ORG-9].
EndUser: Okay, so it's not as difficult as stated is what I'm hearing you say. It's not through sales force, I mean overall.
EndUser: It's because we did it with one of our branches and it was like, it took [DATE-9], honestly, for us to get every LOBN.
Agent: It's known and as long as we've got patterns for it already, it's the [ORG-24] transfer. We've actually got another team that's been working on.
Agent: We just released an accelerator for [ORG-17] systems that sends data directly from an [ORG-17] back into [ORG-1]. And they're also that team that's our [ORG-17] team is going to start working on an [PERSON-14]'s accelerator too.
Agent: So I think between us, our team and what [PERSON-4] can bring, it definitely can't be done. But I can't say that it's out of the box. You just flip a switch. So.
EndUser: Ok, that's helpful. That's better than I thought. So [PERSON-6], thank you.
Agent: No problem. And then of course looking at agency billing and accounting and what that would mean.
Agent: These are investment areas that we've got, you know, some things that we're going to solve through our core platform on top of [ORG-9] and some things that we're going to solve through integrations.
Agent: Of course, everything that's built on platform is available with our APIs. Agency billing and invoicacy would need, I think, a little more work around in terms not work around as in work around. I mean, work.
Agent: Pause around looking at how you want to solve that and what your ERP strategy looks like so that we can complement and send, you know, calculations where we need to send the data where we need to, but also take a look at what you're planning to do for, you know, kind of a elevated invoice capability.
Agent: Now these, I'd love your opinion, [PERSON-24] and [PERSON-17], on, you know, I'm almost thinking now because we'd probably want to get into the demonstration that maybe the first two slides are enough for where we're going with our roadmap.
Agent: But you tell me if you want additional, you know, commentary around why we're building on [ORG-11] cloud, you know, all of the things you get from it, etc.
Agent: So I don't want to be redundant, but I also want to be, you know,
EndUser: Yeah, I think the first two are fine. I think the main thing we want to get out of this meeting is like we talk about partners with [ORG-1]. That's chaching every time.
EndUser: So whatever we put together as the estimate to go to [PERSON-17] has to be holistic and we have to have in included items of what we need that [ORG-1] does not have.
EndUser: Like rate quote by an issue, will we be able to do that?
EndUser: [PERSON-14]'s download, what you said is good, but then we would still need an [ORG-16] partner to do all the work on that.
EndUser: So what would that cost?
EndUser: What about the accounting piece?
EndUser: Because I'm hearing through affinity. they're trying to figure that out right now . those kinds of things are major .
EndUser: Are there anything else that could be brought [ORG-16] in the meeting ?
EndUser: What I'm trying to get ahead of, if you will . that we have answers . all those things need to be talked about . then you have our RDS, maybe take a scenario .
EndUser: Maybe that's what you're thinking of doing , scenario, you know, and actually sho w how [DATE-10] in the life would actually happen . need to be able to visualize , [PERSON-16] producer is going to be using .
EndUser: Salesforce to do everything in her world. Here's how it would look and [PERSON-17] has been a producer a top producer He's our president now.
EndUser: So he knows things pretty well probably more than [PERSON-10] does on [DATE-10] in the life So just a little background and not to dilute what [PERSON-10] knows I don't mean it that way, but I think he's been a leader where [PERSON-10] has been more in the weeds as a producer
Agent: Yep, and I think, I mean, that was super helpful sending over the, you know, the information about [DATE-10] in the life.
Agent: And I know that that's what [PERSON-16] and [PERSON-3] have been working hard on in terms of the demo. Great. Fantastic.
Agent: So maybe we, uh, can we just go through a couple of these slides, [PERSON-3]?
Agent: And I'll just double check that we don't need them. I don't think we need that. We've already talked about where we're there. Go to the next one. We've already, I mean, [PERSON-1]'s already kind of added the architecture side.
Agent: This just goes even deeper. It might be overkill next one. This one, let me know if this makes sense to touch on the reason I have this slide and this has helped with other brokerages who.
Agent: Have been on legacy systems and just that traditional mindset in terms of all of these components and what the difference is between being on like an aim versus what you can do on [ORG-1].
Agent: So, you know, this would include just the baseline functionality and you know we've got the we've got the standard operating procedures your training guide on aim and, you know, it's. pages.
Agent: So there's a lot there that you have to learn how to do. But you know that you're kind of locked into that, whatever they've given you, that's what you have.
Agent: Whereas with [ORG-1], of course, you can keep on Innovation innovating and you can make it your own. You're not locked into a certain way of doing things.
Agent: The enhancements again need to come from [GPE-4] and the AME example with [ORG-1], you can have a center of excellence, a governance that you can create enhancements yourself, etc. Let me know if this makes sense for that audience.
Agent: This has worked well just to ground everyone in what you're going to see when we do the demo.
EndUser: I think this is a good slide.
EndUser: [PERSON-17], what do you think?
EndUser: My only reservation is more of this being, if we, I would prefer to have more of a demonstration rather than talking on this primarily to avoid this is a technology decision.
EndUser: And so I'd like to kind of see more of, this is [DATE-10] in the life if possible.
Agent: All right, so I'll just stick to the two slides that are roadmap so people know and we can talk to those specific points on Okay, the downing. Yeah, and then we'll get right to the demo. That sounds good.
Agent: Okay. Okay. I do think that you were bringing up [ORG-26] of [GPE-5] is that what's different about this approach though is that you aren't beholding to a vendor for
Agent: Customization and changes right I mean that that's a key point that we think is something you've been asking for right You don't want to be in the situation to where you have to go back to either a single source vendor o r limited number of resources .
Agent: To do changes to a black box.
Agent: I mean, with [ORG-1] being open, and the fact that you already have such a large skill set in house that already knows the solution, and you've been using it for [DATE-17], we look for a time where you guys are basically in charge of all of this, right?
Agent: I mean, [PERSON-17]'s and a [ORG-25], and you guys are just cranking out any changes that you need yourself and you're controlling your own destiny as opposed to being beholden to somebody as some of these other traditional software type black box approaches.
Agent: So that was one of the key themes and maybe we can just bring that forward into some of those other talk tracks, [PERSON-6].
Agent: Yep, we'll do. Okay.
Agent: Then we transition over to [PERSON-4]. So I like the idea of doing those two slides, [PERSON-6], and then we'll adjust that talk track a little bit for being able to. you know, control your own destiny.
EndUser: And I think that's where [PERSON-5] made taking back off of [PERSON-6]'s talk track, because through the Implementation process, we work and we've been talking with affinity about this too, right?
EndUser: How we enable them and upskill them so that they can take over at some point.
Agent: Yeah, I know that was a key thing for [PERSON-26], because he was like, look, we, in their previous situation, you know, they were so beholden to origami, they really wanted to make sure that, whatever platform they chose or whatever solution they chose, that you know, [PERSON-25] and team would be able to do their own, their own work and not be beholden to a third party.
Agent: So good call out [PERSON-38]. All right, in this point, [PERSON-6], [PERSON-6] will transition over to [PERSON-4]. Go ahead [PERSON-4].
EndUser: And so the rest of [DATE-9] is going to focus and going forward is going to focus on getting two answers in these three critical areas for the business. And they're at different levels.
EndUser: The first one truly is around a decision.
EndUser: Does [ORG-38] meet the day-to-day needs?
EndUser: So does this meet the digital strategy?
EndUser: Is this a service platform that works for [ORG-2] and its needs all the way through from the single business to the complex programs and commercial?
EndUser: Be looking at doing that through a series of.. . of workshops.
EndUser: The second one is, does the platform overall, all the pieces that have been talked about really allow for a transformation to move the [ORG-2] onto this platform and sunset some of the technology, modify the processes to be more effective going forward.
EndUser: And allow for the ability to add capabilities and grow for [ORG-2] as it continues to grow.
EndUser: And then third one is a decision around does this, does a [ORG-1] technology stack really meet the needs of what the organization needs from a go forward technology investment and align with the trends of the goals and the needs that are critical across the organization so the technical needs.
EndUser: Those are the three key decision points that if They line up, which we believe that they are as yes, and yes, that it makes sense to move forward with [ORG-1].
EndUser: So we're looking at those three, both now and coming back as we come back for the executive session later to ensure that these have been met.
EndUser: To get there, we are going to ask to go through a workshop framework with each of the key groups. And this is a combination.
EndUser: [PERSON-24], this goes back to your comment around making sure we understand which areas are really out of the box, which ones they're going to need an [ORG-16] partner to help integrate or build, and which ones might be complex and custom in configuration so that we can estimate the implementation, have a full cost across the hole in here.
EndUser: Implementation of the RDS and make sure that we're in alignment going into the process rather than discovery and figuring out what happens after the process.
EndUser: So distribution management's a focus area, submission management is focused, product management rating, carrier management, and then accounting and support functions so that we're lined up with what the solution is anticipated to be and what the level of effort would be both from [ORG-1], the SI, [ORG-3] and [PERSON-33].
EndUser: And [PERSON-2] so that that's lined up for an effective structure. The way we're looking to do that is through workshop structure which is a half day session on each of these main topics.
EndUser: Covering the business process alignment, the capabilities, both demonstration and need, aligning that to what is out of the box, understanding simple medium or complex configurations required, finalizing the scoping, and then being able to come out with the approach and estimate for each of the main areas.
EndUser: That are here aligning to where the future is as far as the process goes, not where [DATE-9] is and around where the distribution needs.
EndUser: So that's taking the different various levels within [ORG-2] from single straight through type of single product. that is being placed all the way through complex program and products.
EndUser: So one comment on that, this is really good. I would definitely emphasize a little bit more the workshop thinking, like how we would do iterations because that you kind of brushed on that.
EndUser: But I already know that because I've talked to [ORG-1] and others and you multiple times, so I know that.
EndUser: But that's not going to be clear to [PERSON-17] unless you really call that out, like how you would go about that and how you would go about that.
EndUser: You would approach it becaus e niblitz is the way to go wit h this team. You do days and day s on it . they kind of lose focus.
EndUser: And then the other thing I wanted to add was, you know, just really how that would work. If they can visualize and see and understand how we would go about it, that might be a little bit more helpful.
EndUser: Just a little tidbit I wanted to add.
EndUser: Perfect. I may add a slide then that hits those key points then. Just so it just adds an informative so that they walk away having a good understanding of how this could work. Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, because they're going to be thinking, we've got to drive the car where we're changing the wheels.
EndUser: So how do we keep selling and they make our huge numbers for [DATE-17], why we're transforming to a whole new platform?
EndUser: How does that happen?
EndUser: And what kind of time is going to be needed from my producers and a lot of people in [ORG-2] can visualize the future.
EndUser: They can visualize the here and now [DATE-9] to make the sale, but there's only a few people that can visualize, hey, where do we need to go, if that makes sense.
EndUser: Because we got to have the right people in these workshops too .
EndUser: More on us than you, obviously . Yeah. And so if I missed that in the meeting, please add to that, [PERSON-24], because you're right in alignment with what we're trying to do.
EndUser: Okay, I will. No worries. I'll interjective.
EndUser: Okay. Thank you.
EndUser: Sure. Okay.
EndUser: So with that is kind of the background. Let's kind of jump into the demo and spend the rest of [DATE-9] working through and showing [DATE-10] in the life that has been put together. And [PERSON-1].
EndUser: You want to walk through the high level of this and then pass it to [PERSON-3].
Agent: Yeah, so [DATE-9]'s product demonstration is anchored on the RDS that you shared with us, and you're going to see that we've put together a tailored demonstration based on your specific situation.
Agent: And so throughout the demo, you're going to see us talking about the account and submission management process, reports and dashboards, the communications, status updates, as well as quoting and rating, getting into the multi-layer programs, as well as a little bit on claims management, and then an update concerns around accounting that [PERSON-6] already touched on .
Agent: Earlier. So with that as a backdrop, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to [PERSON-3] to start the demonstration.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-16].
Agent: So our plan is to go through the demonstration using two personas, one regional manager that I will walk through for the first part of it, and then a accounting executive that [PERSON-16] will walk through in [DATE-17].
Agent: So for our regional manager, we're going to focus on that kind of high-level overview, managing relationships with retail brokers, managing their day-to-day work.
Agent: Managing kind of that relationship with one of their agents, one of the retail agents that they work with, and then kind of getting a view into the submissions that have come in and then handing it over to [PERSON-16] to walk through.
Agent: Really kind of the end to end in the life process. So let me switch over.
Agent: They're in [TIME-1].
Agent: And many screens.
Agent: Let me know if you guys can see
Agent: Salesforce. Okay, perfect.
Agent: So I'm, I'm logged in as a mirror.
Agent: So when a mirror lands in [ORG-1], she's going to be greeted with her homepage and with a few key dashboards that she's going to be driving just kind of heard day off of and insights into the business.
Agent: So a way thing you want to do approach this is getting that pile overview of the book of business being able to interact with data that's either in the system or being fed into the system so I can see kind of across all of our business, what our revenue, our clients are, you know, the different clients spending on what industry they're in and we can drive really any metrics right to the surface through these dashboards.
Agent: And so I can get that overview of my book of business and then I can go and start to. deepen that insight into our relationships with those retail agents that we work with.
Agent: So I can see the region that I'm managing and all of the retail agents that are bringing business to us so I can get an understanding of where we're being successful and where we need to grow more, and which agencies are are producing the most for us and sending us the greatest number of submissions and kind of what the performance of those submissions are.
Agent: So I can start to really just drill into the metrics that are going to drive my business. And then as I'm working with different agencies, I can drill down into the metrics on specific producers that we work with.
Agent: So we can kind of think of drilling down through the different layers of, you know, looking at the overall bucket business, then looking at our overall relationships with our retail agencies and then drilling down into, specific relationships with individual producers and seeing their performance.
Agent: And another nice thing about the capabilities within the platform is we can build out this type of dashboard for any of our relationships, whether it's the the underwriters on our teams or the producers that we work with or kind of back-end support teams, we can kind of see metrics across all of those different groups.
Agent: And then I can also just get some high level insights into my day of what are specific tasks that I need to be working through.
Agent: If there are any events that I have coming up [DATE-9] and then I can see an overall activity completion for the team and just get a high low view of performance of the team as I'm just kind of starting my day.
Agent: And then.
Agent: What I want to jump into next is so drilling off of my home page, I want to dive into one of the specific accounts for one of our retail agents that we're working with and just get those details that high lower overview interactions that we're having with this with this agency.
Agent: So I can get the details of the brokerage, all the main information as I think we're all used to seeing in [ORG-1]. all filled out .
Agent: Either by our underives, by the system, or brought in from external systems, I can see the interactions that we're having any meetings or calls or tasks that are associated.
Agent: And then I can see automated action plans that have been created by the system for meetings that we have coming up or any other processes that we want to automate and assign out tasks to different individuals.
Agent: And then I can see overall business milestones, like an agency acquisition or a merger, or if they had any changes in their leadership, we can easily capture that right in the account record page.
Agent: And then I can start to drill into at the sprokerage who are the producers that work there and what's our relationship to them and I can even drill deeper into those producer relationships.
Agent: I can see the policies that are associated. to this agency and then we can draw it deeper into these as we go throughout the process.
Agent: And I think you'll see this get built out as [PERSON-16] walks through [DATE-10] in the life from the county executive.
Agent: And then the final piece that I wanted to just jump to is the list of submissions or opportunities that have come in from from [PERSON-21] from this from this producer so we're able to see that full list of submissions that they have sent in so we get this holistic view.
Agent: Of their relationship with rps and what kind of business they're sending us.
Agent: And so now I'll transition it out to [PERSON-16]'s and he's going to walk through the end to end process of getting a submission in and then going all the way through to the buying process.
Agent: [PERSON-24] and and [PERSON-17], what do you think of the first the first few. Binettes or the first few looks.
EndUser: Well, it was good.
Agent: Anything else you want added in there or that you think could be helpful like from that high level like manager view for the audience on [DATE-1] to see
Agent: No, seems good. Thank you. Yeah, I think we're I think it's good because it's we only have [TIME-2]. I think it's good. Okay. All right, [PERSON-16], all you
Agent: All right, can you see my screen there?
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Ok, great. So I will pick up, like I said, I'll pick up from where he is as he's gone through things. I've logged into the digital platform as well as [PERSON-8].
Agent: And [PERSON-24], is this where you would refer to [PERSON-8] as an account executive or would he be called a producer in your world here?
Agent: Because there's the retail worker.
Agent: Do you mean [PERSON-34]?
Agent: No, sorry, [PERSON-8]. My user here, as I'm logged in, I'm a producer, or I'm not the retail broker, I'm working on behalf of [ORG-2] to complete that submission and to get it out to market.
Agent: What would you refer to that individual as?
Agent: Is that a producer?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Ok. All right. I'll rename them. We've labeled them like a go-to-market or an accounting executive output of... producer in there. So I'm acting on his behalf and I'm logged into the same application.
Agent: Now, you see the application has changed slightly and what's visible to me. This is more of an action oriented landing homepage as opposed to a dashboard and managerial.
Agent: So you'll see quickly up in the top of my [DATE-9] task. Those are a little different than what [PERSON-3] saw because those are specific to me and those are things that have been assigned to me specifically.
Agent: I don't have any events on the calendar [DATE-9]. This is my own personal calendar with an inside of [ORG-1]. So as things come up, they would be visible there.
Agent: Very similar to what [PERSON-3] saw in the management dashboard was a new submissions list of what has come in and needs to be worked. So this would be kind of the cue approach to managing these submissions.
Agent: I can go in and I can pick one of these and drill into it. These that you see here, [DATE-21], [DATE-14], these are actually using our email services.
Agent: So we've emailed into the system and it's automatically created that opportunity. When it creates that opportunity, it hits the system right away so that we can begin to assign that and get that out to the right individual.
Agent: It also creates a set of actions that need to be completed. We call those an action plan for that opportunity.
Agent: So what we did was we took that operating procedure document and we took a few of the flow items out of there and we created an action plan based on the steps that are necessary to manage a submission.
Agent: When that action plan is created, it creates those tasks and those activities and those are going to be assigned to individuals based on whether based on who created the action plan based on a role based on a responsibility.
Agent: Etc.
Agent: When this opportunity hit the system, [DATE-14], for this quote for general liability, it created an action plan and we can see that one of those tasks got assigned to me and is showing up here in [DATE-9]'s task.
Agent: So I don't need to necessarily work from this queue. I can. I can go into it directly. Or I can just say, OK, here's the things that are high priority for me. I need to complete these things [DATE-9].
Agent: One of those is I need to perform a clearance search on this new submission that came in. I'll drill into that submission directly from this task list. So again, no hunting around for work to be done.
Agent: I'm going to work right for my home page. It's very action driven. When I get land on this opportunity, now again, this was an email brought in. I haven't entered any of this information. This was all through automation.
Agent: The body of the email is mapped into the description so we can see what was written in from the email. They'd like to quote for the statement of values for General [PERSON-38]. It's a [GPE-6] client.
Agent: They've attached a loss run and an SOV. Those attachments are visible down here in the notes and attachments. We're going to automatically attach those to the opportunity for safe keeping and reference.
Agent: And we also know where this came from. This came from Leaven agency as the agency or broker and the primary producer there was [PERSON-38]. So that we're tracking that bit of information.
Agent: At this point, we've got the action items that we need to complete. One of those is a clearance search.
Agent: And if I'm having trouble or I'm new to the system and I need help performing that clearance search, we've got knowledge embedded here. So I can simply type in perform clearance search.
Agent: And I'm going to get help files for your new submission and both process.
Agent: And if I mouse over that, I've got details from the document you share with us about how do I clear a submission?
Agent: How do I perform those searches?
Agent: So help right here within the application. So that's one area to kind of help users transition into a new world, into a new system as they use it.
Agent: So for now, what we'll do is we'll go ahead and we'll take this opportunity and we'll kick off this guided process that's visible here in this action launcher.
Agent: In our world of [ORG-1], [ORG-33] is a framework to be able to launch guided processes for the user where you're actually initiating and executing a business process, as opposed to me going into the opportunity, going into the quote screen, create a new record, choose the record type, populate the fields.
Agent: These are going to, this is going to guide the user through the appropriate steps and allow [ORG-16] and automation throughout that process.
Agent: So what I've done is I've taken a little bit of the information kinsured with that [ORG-21], and we created a guided process to help us guide through that process.
Agent: I'll click that link and launch that guided process for creating the rating.
Agent: So here we know the account because we knew the opportunity that we started from, so it's context sensitive, we can bring that information in, we can also upload those SOBs directly from the CSV.
Agent: So I'll choose yes, I'll upload those files, We'll pick the file.
Agent: And as you see the status, as soon as this is uploaded and you see a green check here, then that file is uploaded and in the system and ready to go.
Agent: Now what I have not done for this demonstration, is art of the possible right now, I want to be fully transparent.
Agent: We're not importing, we're not bringing the file from the opportunity into this process yet, that is doable with some configuration work. For the sake of time, I'm just simply importing it again.
Agent: And using the opportunity as a landing place for reference of that file. When we upload that document, we see those entries come in. Now, this is a high-level summary of those entries.
Agent: If we want to make adjustments to it, then we would edit those, and we can edit any of those field values that have come in.
Agent: And if we want to add, maybe we missed some real property value here, and notice that my total is 17.1101167957481438. Let's say that we've got another 1101 in real property value.
Agent: Then we're going to update that total [ORG-34] in real-time as we go through this process. So now we're at 9.0381795964171.
Agent: Next step is to go through and can mention that some of this goes through the ping identity for cleansing. Maybe there's some changes that are made based on the data that comes back.
Agent: So we'll see that total value was updated again. We were at 17.7973407349781. Now we're at 11.682616598877740. And again, another chance to edit that if necessary. You can see that I put in 795,000 there.
Agent: The information that came back from paying would be 17,000. So we can overwrite and adjust as necessary. Now I'm gonna go into that. We've captured the details, we've cleansed the information.
Agent: Let's get into the rating of these properties now that we know that the properties are in a good place. and we're going to do this for general liabilities.
Agent: We're going to pick the product that we want to quote here and that's going to drive a look into our product configuration of what's available. Our locations continue to come in. The rest of this would be auto-populated.
Agent: I'm going to go ahead and click on demo auto-fill and that just simply fills this information so you don't have to watch me type it. And then we can upload lots from reports.
Agent: I'm going to pick up my pace a bit because I will have more time on [DATE-1]. But this is just one option for quoting and writing. So we'll go through this.
Agent: Ability is to select multiple carriers and quote through those carriers and get those quotes. If we wanted to, we could configure this so that maybe we want two force them.
Agent: We want to do business with [PRODUCT-3], but if we don't, and the producer decides not to quote [PRODUCT-3], we want to require, hey, why did you not quote through them so we can capture that information and better that relationship.
Agent: Or if you have, an in-house division that underwrites some of these.
Agent: Maybe you want two force them to quote through the in-house every single time we can make that a mandatory feel that is not editable and is required so that always comes back. Now it's taken the inputs.
Agent: It's taken the attributes we've collected and the carriers, and it's gone out and it's said, OK, here's some product options that are available from the various carriers, whether that be fiber, [PERSON-16], or [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: And we can see different price points. This is where I've configured a little bit of a dynamic nature of the demonstration.
Agent: If we wanted to do a single product, we could select that product and we could move forward and we could configure that product.
Agent: Or in the case of like a program with multiple products and multiple layers of risks, I've set this process up that way so that when I click next, it's actually going to generate a quote and it's going to put all of those products from those carriers so that we can configure and quote from each of those carriers and then break that risk apart.
EndUser: Oh, I've got to add one thing here that you might want to accentuate is we have something it's a limitation [DATE-9] and aim where they want to send out various letters to multiple carriers at the same time they have to [DATE-9] do them individually and this is a real pain point.
EndUser: So I know [ORG-1] takes care of this so you might want to interweave this in the conversation. Just a thought.
Agent: Yeah. And since it's only [DATE-24], I actually have that where we send through multiple carriers and contacts. I'll see what I can pull and put in here for that.
EndUser: Yeah, if you could demo and show that real time, that would be a real win because that's a pain point [DATE-9]. Thank you.
EndUser: I have an example where it's more of a brokerage solution where it's where the we're going out to RFP
Agent: And we're sending those RFP responses or we're gathering questions and we're sending those out to all carriers at the same time, would something like that fit, or would it be better to be more letter related?
EndUser: Rfp.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: All right, I will pull that into this into this example as well. Okay. Good point. So this creates a quote and, and, uh, associates it to the opportunity.
Agent: So I'll jump forward and we'll go into the, um, quote process. So from here we can do the automation, of course, where we land on the quotes. Let me just manually go into a quote here.
Agent: And I will update this so that it will be more streamlined. I'm kind of in a hurry here since we're running out of time for [DATE-10].
Agent: So I'll click on the quote. Once we come out of that process and we land on the quote, there's a guidance, what we call in-application guidance.
Agent: Again, to help you with business change, they can either dismiss this or use it. It will learn who uses it, who doesn't. So it doesn't continue to pop up for that individual.
Agent: But as we click next, we can see that it will actually tell us where to click and what to view and how to use the system. I'll go ahead and else snooze this.
Agent: Totally configurable, very easy to get set up. It's all within the application. But we can view the details of the quote. We can see if there's any underwriting exception. So underwriting exceptions are written based off of product rules.
Agent: We can see this one did not have any exceptions. But later in the demonstration, we'll talk about that product configuration and setup and how we can execute those rules.
Agent: So we went from an email submission, we went through the guided process for the quote. That's one way to get the quote into the system.
Agent: The other way is for a broker themselves to join and enter into a broker portal and the broker can then submit the quote manually via their process.
Agent: So as I come in via [PERSON-38] in the broker portal, I could come down and do a create quote.
Agent: [PERSON-38] isn't going to be asked, well, what type of quote do you need?
Agent: I need a commercial quote. Well, this commercial quote process triggers the exact same process that I had on the other side.
Agent: Only we see that there's no context yet, right?
Agent: There's no account showing here, because this is just frank doing a general quote.
Agent: He can either upload those SOVs like we did before, or if he doesn't want to upload them, then you can simply do a new, and you can enter that information manually. We just automated that process with the upload.
Agent: And so he can go through that exact same process. We'll go ahead and import these.
Agent: So what we're doing now is we're just creating a second quote. Only we're doing it as the retail broker through the broker portal. And we'll upload those.
Agent: We get our statements of value, and we'll just move forward with those. There's our properties. Let's go through the rating. So I won't go through the whole process.
Agent: Just another avenue of being able to do that quote directly as the broker. And now I'll come back as our producer within risk placement services. And we were on that quote.
Agent: So I want to jump now into a multi-layered program. And then we're going to come back and revisit a quote and product configuration and actually issue and bind that quote and see what that looks like.
Agent: But from a multi-layered program, I've got it. a policy in place here that I'm following a root risk policy.
Agent: And we've got this for safety sign that we've set up, so we've got a little bit more data that we can walk through and show. We show all the policies that are covering this root risk.
Agent: We can see the back commercial errors and omissions, employee liability, employment practices. and the risk taken of those policies.
Agent: In the case where we've got general liability and it's a split risk, then we're gonna indicate where the risk lies as well as whether that's a tier one or a tier two or your priority one, priority two, or potentially a lead fallout, however you call those in your business.
Agent: I got it. [PERSON-1]'s check up in your business. And then if we need to, we can go through that policy structure and what this looks like.
Agent: But what this allows for is that because now we have the root policy and we have each of these policies or quotes, then each of these can be managed separately.
Agent: So if I were to drill into one of these Professional liability as one of these, I'll call it child policies of the root. We've got all the details of that policy.
Agent: We can see that for this policy, we've got claims filed on it. We don't have, we have one activity that was done that claims submission. So that's already been completed and sent.
Agent: We know the producer on this was 11 agency, but it was [PERSON-38] instead of [PERSON-38] on this policy. So we can track that.
Agent: And then of course, we can look at the coverages of this policy, what was chosen. We can generate the Revenue schedule of this policy and we can look at earn versus unearned.
Agent: This is all part of our policy services in the solution. And then of course, billing transaction, whether that be future or past.
Agent: We can see in the past dates, we've got the transaction and we've got the posted date and we actually have a premium payment that we're expecting and it has not posted yet.
Agent: And that would be for our [DATE-17] payment. So we can track that. We also can look through all the insured items and then we've got related.
Agent: Related is any record in the system that holds information about this policy or related to it. We've created a quick list here of all of the related things so we can see that there's two claims associated to this.
Agent: There's a policy term associated to this. There's a brokerage split associated to this and I can see what those brokerage splits are with [PERSON-21]. Agency unified drill into that. I can see that there's a split.
Agent: And there's a couple different payees on this split on the 9 side of the agency. So I'll come back to the.
Agent: There we go to my policy here and again, and then I've got all the related records action lunch or changes here for the policy. Whether it's sending documents of big in the address or the endorsement quote.
Agent: And so just walking through what that policy looks like.
Agent: Then up at the root level, if I wanted to file a claim, whether it be as the end user or as a broker, or they call in, then I would file the claim process here and I can capture the relevant details for filing a claim.
Agent: In this case, we'll call it errors and omissions. Again, what you're seeing here is the guided process that we can go through and just capture that information and pass it on to the collector here. Very dynamic in nature.
Agent: Maybe we want to ask some questions, like some knockout questions, like how many claims, what they have for, they're okay. If it goes to five claims, that's going to trigger additional investigation.
Agent: So let's have them confirm that it's five, and they would need to confirm that disclosure. And then move forward.
Agent: Now this is where the system can either decide which carriers this claim is filed against, and we've looked up the policies that make up this risk and where the risk was taken, and we've identified these three policies that this claim would be filed against.
Agent: Or based on your business, you could choose which carriers you're going to file that claim for.
Agent: And so the claim process, again, goes through the wrap up and the complete and automatically creates those records, automatically would send those out through the integrations with those carriers or notifications.
Agent: And then from there, what I would like to do in the demo, and I know we're out of time [DATE-9], is to go specifically into product management. So we went through the quoting email submission, quoting as a broker.
Agent: And product, and then I'd like to come in and say, okay, let's go into our product management, and specifically, let's go into a product called Professional liability, and let's talk about, I set this up for our demonstration, how we would configure the product, how we would determine what those coverages are, how we could write rules and underwriting exceptions and eligibility, associate commissions and commission schedules, taxes fees, we can do product simulation, and then how this ties to the rating engine and then what that rating engine looks like.
Agent: So I would go from product configuration into the details here. The details then point to how this is rated.
Agent: So I would pull the rating procedure here and I would go into the rating procedure specifically, talk about version control, effective dating, and then go into the actual reading procedure and how this is a drag and drop designer.
Agent: And we can see here that much like in your [PRODUCT-4] spreadsheet, there's often lookups to other tabs. We have those lookups and we pass in an input, we pass in an output.
Agent: I'll talk about how this is tied to the product. We do our lookups and then we perform our calculations to get an outcome. And then that passes back for the product rating.
Agent: We also have the ability to simulate these so I would show a simulation. And when you simulate these. It tracks through. I'll just do this real quick because this is about.
Agent: [PERSON-16], if you've got extra time, [PERSON-17] said he's got [TIME-3] so you can show something. Yeah. I put a buffer in just in case.
Agent: Great.
EndUser: So I would pass in. So these things that I'm typing in here are the inputs that would actually come from the product. Thanks guys, I have to hop. I really appreciate it.
EndUser: I'll do the introductions, [PERSON-1] [DATE-1] and then hand it over to you. I'll give you a heads up of who will be attending because there's gonna be other producers and leaders on the call.
EndUser: And then could you send me the Zoom that you want?
EndUser: And I'll propagate that in the meeting. Thank you very much. This is good, this is really good. So thank you for your time here.
Agent: Appreciate it. Thank you. [PERSON-35].
EndUser: I need to run as well. So I will catch up with you, [PERSON-1]. Thanks. Okay.
Agent: Gotcha. Thanks.
Agent: So as we put those inputs in and we simulate that, we can see each of the steps that were completed as part of that simulation, even down to the point of what was the input passed in?
Agent: Well, the input was 1 million flame, 1 million, 541 was the output. And then we continue to look those up.
Agent: And so we can see at each step of our process where it failed, what we're expecting, make sure we can confirm those, and then even as far as the calculations, what did the received input into this calculation, and what was the output of this calculation.
Agent: And then ultimately, over here on the left, what our total outcomes are. I can modify and do different scenarios here. So for example, what's our total out here now is 5,957.
Agent: Let's say that our employee count went to 17,000. And I want to simulate that. And rather than 5,957, now I'm at 24,000. So I can confirm that my calculations are reacting accordingly. So I can simulate that here.
Agent: So what I've done is I've tied the product. Let me come back to the product here. Professional liability. When we look at those coverages and I click on let's say coverage limits, limits here.
Agent: There's an attribute for these limits. There's the selections that they can pick from a product perspective. You saw that injured in my simulation and that's going in from the product because it's triggered as rating.
Agent: It's mapped as an input and then we get an output back. And I can also simulate this now one level up.
Agent: At the product level and say based on the effective date, remember those are version controlled and effective dated. My output right now is blank. I've got 39 employees in here.
Agent: And if I simulate this, then I'm gonna have my output and I can see I've got 4,319 coming back as total pricing.
Agent: Again, if I change my employee count, I know that one will adjust the price and I re-simulate that rather than 4,319 now I'm coming back to 14,000. So product to the rating back to the product.
Agent: Now let's go back to our original opportunity. Rather than going through the guided process of here, where we're automatically uploading and doing that automation for you, we can also manually create that quote. So let's create a quote.
Agent: In this time, let's do it for Professional liability. We'll take a quote, let's do a new quote. We'll pick the quote type, straight quote. I'll just put a quick placeholder in here.
Agent: I'm going to call this PEL Live, so Professional liability I quote, these others we can require from your business. I'm just going to put this as a placeholder for the demo.
Agent: Now I land on the quote record and I can begin to manage every aspect of this quote record. The very first thing being I need to add a product.
Agent: Well, what product is it?
Agent: We saw general liability earlier from [ORG-38], his [PERSON-33] T2. Well, we talked about Professional liability, so let's add that into this quote. The system will bring that quote and all of the coverages into my quote.
Agent: You can see the price is zero because I haven't entered or configured. the parameters necessary for the rating to take place. So I would choose the state, again, proper attributes needed to do the quoting process.
Agent: I'd choose the date the business started, we'll just select the date. You can see different controls here, whether they're drop downs, radio button, dates, sliders, all very configurable.
Agent: And that's where we'd like to have a future workshop to show you exactly how to do this and how flexible this process is. So I'll set a few of these and then I'll click rate.
Agent: Now, the application is looking directly at that product we talked about, joining the migrating engine and bringing all the way back through and giving me a rate for this Professional liability.
Agent: So we've gone all the way through the process. Now, I've got it quoted. Underwriting decision is here because I'm in the draft status.
Agent: That means that because I'm only in draft status, if I execute this guided process, it's going to make sure that I don't have any exceptions on this quote. And I don't have any exceptions on this quote.
Agent: I don't have any exceptions because I didn't write any rules to create exceptions. These exceptions would be like your carrier exceptions. Maybe they only want one million in risk.
Agent: And if it goes over a million, you would write an exception so that your producer needs to work with them and sort out the specifics.
Agent: Or maybe you have eligibility that it's at 1.0 and then they don't want any part of it. No appetite for that. So we would just take that product out if it's over 1.5 million.
Agent: So you've got those eligibility rules. You've got those exception rules. And then furthermore, if we write this into a quoted status, we're going to see that a rules log pops up and we didn't violate any rules.
Agent: So we can do verification and validation that things are in good order as we move from one business status to the next status. The idea would be that this is quoted.
Agent: I'm going to refresh my screen and under guided flows, you'll see under ready decision does not apply to a quoted quote.
Agent: Now I've got the ability to just directly issue the policy because we've already ran those checks to make sure that we don't have any violations or exceptions.
Agent: So now when I issue this policy, again, a guided process to do the work for you.
Agent: Do you want to set up a new payment plan?
Agent: I'll choose no for the speed of the time [DATE-9]. And then. It indicates and it knows that I've got a root risk policy in place.
Agent: So would I like to associate this to that root risk and put this under there?
Agent: Yes, I would. And I can choose which policies those are. I only have one right now. So I'll choose this RP 843. This is going from a quote. It's moving forward and binding that policy.
Agent: It's also associating that to that root risk. And then we'll get a simple confirmation that has been created. So I've got confirmation of that policy. Now if I come back to my risk policy.
Agent: And I've got my risk lawyers here. We see eight items. If I refresh that, I think I deleted one. There's the item there, my safety sign.
Agent: So if I drill into it, there's the one we created and our Professional liability.
Agent: And so we've gone now from email submission, quoting via email submission to get a process, a broker quoting via the broker portal, going through the claim.
Agent: Process, looking at that program and those multi-tiered policies, as well as then we took a look at the product, the rating, and then we came in and we actually did a quote through what we call the lightning experience where you would manually enter the information.
Agent: And with that, that's really what I wanted to show for [DATE-10]. Like I said, that's kind of the speed round of things.
Agent: [PERSON-17], what are your thoughts on that approach of going through the quote rate bind and then taking a moment and showing them the flexibility of product configuration to show how quickly they could bring those products to market and for their various programs?
EndUser: Yeah, I like it. Thank you very much.
Agent: Yeah, is that kind of what you're thinking for the like the day in the life of the usability, but then the flexibility?
EndUser: Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Okay.
Agent: And one area that we can touch on if we have time was as these quotes, opportunities come in, they can be managed in multiple currencies too, right?
Agent: So if I were to need to do another different Opportunity and quote and I just simply use a different price book. So if we look at Let's see. Let's go back to my home page.
Agent: That's the home pages is valuable because it gives me everything I need to see right so if I go back to my home page and we have submissions then we've got an opportunity down here we put the conversion ratio right within the multi-currency of the system and it's going to convert that so this one done in <inaudible> replay So it's just simply same product different price book based on that conversion factor.
Agent: So based on where it is, what country it is, then we can do those conversions and we can manage that process the same as what we just walked through. And then system automation too.
Agent: So I've got a scenario can where maybe on an opportunity or a quote, a quote has a certain status and people need to be notified.
Agent: So through integration, in the case it's [NORP-1], it would send a message out through maybe some [ORG-10] users and notify them.
Agent: Or if the status changes, then it would need to send out to [ORG-38] users and it would notify the Teams users of certain status or a certain updates.
Agent: And even to the point of if that message goes out and it fails, then the system knows it failed.
Agent: So let's go ahead and log the fact that it failed, create a task for the system administrator to go look at the connection and the system begins to manage itself so that as a producer, I see, oh, something went wrong, I need to call, can and say, can go fix this or can get one of your guys to fix this, the system would just create a task for you and need to be notified.
Agent: So it's just saving time all around. And again, getting things in the right key with the right time to work on more quickly without all the admin overhead.
EndUser: Yep, makes sense. I. I guess I know it's more of a timing issue, but while it's good to see like the currency think that one, at least for us, isn't necessarily required.
EndUser: So if it comes a timing issue, then definitely don't need to include that. But definitely was good to have that like the tasks and things like that.
EndUser: Did you were bringing up?
EndUser: Yeah. Okay. No good to know because I'm sure time will be an issue because
Agent: It's just easier to talk live and with multiple people and questions, we want to make sure and fill the questions. So if that's not important, we'll just, I'll leave it out.
Agent: And then if we need to come back to it at some point, we can always come back to it. No big deal. Perfect, I appreciate it, thank you. Yep. So that's what I had on Q for things.
Agent: Yeah, good. And then we're just going to wrap up with, you know, getting your, Agreement and consideration to move forward on the workshop approach can so.
Agent: And then any other questions as it come up as far as might be on the parking lot so. That's kind of the flow for [DATE-16] on [DATE-1] and.
Agent: I'll send over the zoom to [PERSON-24] and if you guys will let me know who the other. Attendees are that would be great and will be there in person as we discussed.
EndUser: Okay sounds good. Thank you very much. Looks good. Thank you very much. Have a great one. Okay. Bye.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are the questions they asked:

1. ""What's been negotiated recently with [PERSON-2]. So are the discounts holistic, meaning all the divisions combined or per division? How does that work?""
2. ""You know, our goal is not only to do this presentation, but come back and do the executive readout. So, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll have you meet [PERSON-10] in a different time.""
3. ""What I'm trying to get ahead of, if you will, is if we have answers to all those things, we need to talk about before you have our RDS, maybe take a scenario, and actually show how [DATE-10] in the life would actually happen.""
4. ""I would prefer to have more of a demonstration rather than talking on this primarily to avoid this is a technology decision.""
5. ""How would that happen? What kind of time is going to be needed from my producers and a lot of people in [ORG-2] can visualize [DATE-10] in the life, but there's only a few people that can visualize, hey, where do we need to go, if that makes sense.""
6. ""You would go about that and how you would go about that. You would approach it because niblitz is the way to go with this team. You do days and day s on it . they kind of lose focus.""
7. ""I may add a slide then that hits those key points then. Just so it just adds an informative so that they walk away having a good understanding of how this could work.""
8. ""What do you think of the first the first few bites or the first few looks for the audience on [DATE-1] to see?""
9. ""What would you refer to that individual as? Is that a producer?""
10. ""What do you think of the first the first few bites or the first few looks for the audience on [DATE-1] to see?""

[PERSON-1], you want to walk through the high level","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Yes, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They specifically mentioned that the product meets their day-to-day needs and their digital strategy, and that it works for their business from single products to complex programs and commercial. They also mentioned that the product allows for transformation and growth for their organization. However, they did mention that they need to go through workshops to ensure that the product meets their needs in specific areas and to estimate the implementation cost.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer: The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs in the following areas:

1. Discount structure: The customer asked whether the discounts are holistic (for all divisions combined) or per division. The sales rep didn't provide a clear answer, and this could be an opportunity to better understand the customer's requirements and provide a tailored solution.

2. Integration with [ORG-14]: The customer mentioned that [ORG-14] has not been as excited to do a proof of concept with them for data integration. The sales rep could have spent more time discussing this challenge, understanding the customer's concerns, and proposing potential solutions.

3. Accounting and billing: The customer expressed interest in understanding the accounting and billing process within the proposed solution. While the sales rep briefly touched upon this topic, they could have delved deeper to address the customer's concerns and provide more clarity.

4. [ORG-16] partner involvement: The customer mentioned the need for an [ORG-16] partner to help with integration and building specific components. The sales rep could have spent more time discussing the potential costs and timeline associated with this partnership, as well as exploring any potential concerns the customer might have.

5. Scenario-based demonstration: The customer expressed a desire to visualize how the solution would work in their day-to-day operations. The sales rep could have prepared a more detailed scenario-based demonstration to help the customer better understand the benefits and practical applications of the proposed solution.

6. Workshop structure: The customer mentioned the need to understand which areas are out-of-the-box, which ones require an [ORG-16] partner, and which ones might be complex and custom in configuration. The sales rep could have spent more time discussing the workshop structure to ensure that these concerns are addressed and that the customer has a clear understanding of the implementation process.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the flexibility and speed at which new products can be brought to market using the seller's product. They specifically mentioned the ease of associating commissions and commission schedules, taxes, and fees with products, as well as the ability to perform product simulations. The customer also appreciated the integration of the product with the rating engine and the ability to manage multiple currencies. They found the guided process for quoting, binding, and issuing policies to be particularly useful.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or who the correct person would be if they were not. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The seller and customer discuss various aspects of the seller's product and potential implementation, but no clear decisions or next steps are outlined.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""Does [ORG-3] meet the day-to-day needs? So does this meet the digital strategy? Is this a service platform that works for [ORG-2] and its needs all the way through from the single business to the complex programs and commercial?""

The customer seemed more engaged after this question as they started discussing the workshops to understand the capabilities and requirements in detail.

2. ""Does the platform overall, all the pieces that have been talked about really allow for a transformation to move the [ORG-2] onto this platform and sunset some of the technology, modify the processes to be more effective going forward. And allow for the ability to add capabilities and grow for [ORG-2] as it continues to grow?""

This question led to a discussion on the decision points and the need for workshops to ensure that the platform meets the organization's needs.

3. ""Does a [ORG-1] technology stack really meet the needs of what the organization needs from a go forward technology investment and align with the trends of the goals and the needs that are critical across the organization?""

The customer showed interest in this question as well, discussing the technical needs and alignment with the organization's goals.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"* The sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of the company or product when discussing the contracts and price protections. They mentioned that the contracts and price protections are in place, but they could have emphasized how these aspects benefit the customer and set the foundation for a successful implementation.
* The sales rep could have also done a better job articulating the value proposition when discussing the integration with [PERSON-21]. They mentioned that the integration is possible, but they could have emphasized how this integration would benefit the customer and make their processes more efficient.
* The sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition when discussing the product management and rating engine. They briefly mentioned the capabilities, but they could have provided more detail on how these features would benefit the customer and make their processes more efficient.

Question: What are the next steps for this sales opportunity?

* The next steps for this sales opportunity include the presentation and executive readout, as well as a meeting with [PERSON-10] at a different time. The sales rep also mentioned the possibility of coming back to discuss certain topics, such as currency conversion and system automation, if time allows.
* Additionally, the sales rep mentioned the need to get agreement and consideration to move forward with the workshop approach. This suggests that the next steps also include scheduling and preparing for these workshops.

Question: Were there any mentions of competitors during the call?

* Yes, there were mentions of competitors during the call. The sales rep mentioned that [PERSON-14] sees the sales rep's company as a competitor, and that they have not been as excited to do a proof of concept with the sales rep's company on the integration.
* The sales rep also mentioned that the sales rep's company is not beholden to a single source vendor or a limited number of resources for customization and changes, unlike some of these other traditional software type black box approaches.

Question: Were there any blockers or concerns mentioned by the customer that could prevent closing the deal?

* There were a few blockers or concerns mentioned by the customer that could prevent closing the deal. One concern was the integration with [PERSON-21] and the cost of that integration. The customer also mentioned the need to understand the level of effort and cost for the implementation, as well as the need to ensure that the platform meets the day-to-day needs and allows for a transformation to move the organization onto the platform.
* Additionally, the customer mentioned the need to align the solution with the technical needs and goals of the organization, and the need to make sure that the solution meets the digital strategy and is a service platform that works for the organization's needs.
* The customer also mentioned the need to understand which areas are out of the box, which ones will require an [ORG-16] partner to help integrate or build, and which ones might be complex and custom in configuration. This suggests that the complexity and cost of the implementation could be a potential blocker for the customer.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were:

1. The customer wanted to understand the discount structure - whether it is holistic (for all divisions combined) or per division.
2. The customer needed clarity on how the [ORG-1] platform integrates with their existing systems, particularly [ORG-21] and [PERSON-14]. They were interested in the ease of data transfer between these systems and the cost of such integration.
3. The customer wanted to ensure that the accounting piece was addressed properly, as they had heard from affinity that they were trying to figure this out.
4. The customer wanted to know if rate quote by an issue and other specific functionalities they required were possible with the seller's product.
5. The customer wanted to understand the onboarding process and the resources required for implementation.

The customer also wanted to see a demonstration of the product, focusing on how it would fit into their day-to-day operations and help them achieve their goals."
video_19788_167_6qr3y000000g2A7AAI,"Agent: So, just to set up a little bit of context, so me and [PERSON-1] had a brief discussion on how [ORG-1] could help [PERSON-2] restaurant chain in general and of course the other brands as and when we go through this partnership.
Agent: Now we identified that there were two products which were of key relevance for [PERSON-2] restaurant.
Agent: One is engagement and [GPE-1], but we drill down that engagement should be the first level of, you know, the product that [PERSON-2] restaurant should look at in terms of improving the engagement that they have with customer.
Agent: Now to give you a quick context, [PERSON-3] on the product itself, what that product does is basically it helps you send very personalized email SMS and WhatsApp and also [ORG-2] goes customers want social media and various trigger points .
Agent: Example, someone added something to the car t and they did not buy it, right ?
Agent: Do you nudge that customer to actually make a purchase ?
Agent: Someone is constantly coming to your restaurant , do you upsell, cross-sell those customers ?
Agent: Do you make sure that they keep coming bac k to your restaurant ?
Agent: Right?
Agent: So [DATE-1] I have on the call [PERSON-4] with me. She is the lead solution engineer.
Agent: She will be the one who will be conducting [DATE-1]'s session in terms of taking you through few of the use cases, the look and feel of the platform and how exactly, you know, [PERSON-2] restaurant will be able to leverage this platform.
Agent: It would be a very personalized demo.
Agent: Having said that, I would love if you guys interact, ask as many questions as possible, feel free to interrupt us and keep asking the use cases or whatever comes in top of your mind. So I hope that's okay.
Agent: The agenda is okay with both of you guys. Yeah.
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: Great. Now
Agent: With that, I will just hand it over to [PERSON-4] to begin our session. Over to you, [PERSON-4]. Sure.
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-4]. So with that, I will start sharing my screen. Please do let me know once it is visible to you.
EndUser: Yeah,
Speaker 6: We can see now.
Agent: Thank you, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: So just before
Agent: We begin the [DATE-1] session, just a quick forward looking statement from [PERSON-5] that all your purchasing decision should be made on the basis of a current corrupting capabilities because we are a publicly traded company.
Agent: And we would like to thank you and [PERSON-6] Sir for sparing time out of your busy schedules and we hope we make a valuable use of your time to live with us.
Agent: Just a quick glimpse of what we'll cover in [DATE-2]. Although [PERSON-7] is already spoken about the different solutions, which are a fitment for the project group.
Agent: With that, I'll just provide a little bit of introduction of the solution that we are proposing. Our understanding of the key areas or objectives that we've gathered from the last call.
Agent: Based on that, what is the three defined customer journey that we bring on the table?
Agent: And also... followed by a product demonstration on how easy it is to stitch all of this together how you can create those one-to-one customer experiences, right, in order t o redefine their journey.
Agent: And then we can talk about some of the customers we are working wit h within your industry and the next steps as well . So just a quick look at our rating.
Agent: We are in rated number one in sales service, [PRODUCT-1] and Marketing platform. These are some of the key logos that we are working with within [GPE-2]. Again, this is a very small snapshot.
Agent: Globally, again, this is a huge proof for printings, especially in terms of food and beverages industry. We are working with [ORG-3] and the working with [ORG-4] and we are working with [PERSON-8], so these site.
EndUser: Are some of the key clients we need to be in this industry.
Agent: I wish you just a second, but you mentioned you are working with [ORG-5], I'll have to not.
EndUser: As well in [GPE-3].
EndUser: Share some of that. No, you mentioned some name right, you just know you're [ORG-6] are in [GPE-2].
Agent: Oh, [ORG-6] are in [GPE-2], okay, okay. So in [ORG-4], essentially they're using a wider a [PRODUCT-2] of [ORG-1] products
EndUser: And just take [TIME-1] to talk about some of the use cases they are trying to do. Right, so in terms of... Any [ORG-7], any one
Agent: Of the logos what you have, anyone is in a food and beverages industry?
Agent: Yes, we do have a lot of as well and global as well.
EndUser: In [GPE-2]
Agent: [PERSON-9] is basically a cinema as you know, in [GPE-2] and essentially some of the use cases they are trying to solve is around the food and beverages.
Agent: So in case you like cheese popcorn, the notch that they are going to send you is basis on you know, it's a cheese popcorn with a you know [ORG-8] combo, right.
Agent: So it creates those affinities, propensities on what you are likely to order and then serve those marketed messages according to you. Again, this is over.
Agent: Wider sales force product use case but these are some of the use cases they are tryin g to solve In terms of food and [PERSON-10] while I want you to cover it at the end but I'll just [PERSON-13] e a minute here So we're working with bitties and boughs This is [GPE-4] and also a [GPE-5] coffee chain that we are working with .
Agent: Again, you can see the amount of impact that we've made. We've made emails of which response time we affected them. There was also an increase in use that are signups.
Agent: They also reduced a lot of time in customer segmentation and creating those Marketing campaigns on a very personalized one-to-one on a scale level. So this is one of the use cases. Then we're also working with [GPE-6] wide-wings.
Agent: This is again a global use case that we have. They wanted to send a lot of push notifications.
Agent: So with [ORG-1] Marketing cloud, you get all the channels on one single platform, whic h is your email, SMS, WhatsApp, or push And the key use cases were around push So with redefining all those customer journeys, different touch points, they were able t o see a lot of significant impact in their Marketing ROI as well as create those campaigns o n a very far, with the various small effort But you don't have to navigate between teams or teams here and there for just getting the segments or the creative.
Agent: You can do everything on one single platform. Then we're also working with [PERSON-15] as a whole group. And then this case is as well. Again, this is a wider story of [ORG-1], Marketing and [GPE-1] platform.
EndUser: Cloud engagement
Agent: Here, this is a pizza chain based out of [GPE-4].
Agent: For them, some of the key use cases that they wanted to solve was that, are you liking as an individual, right?
Agent: Ankithma prefer a [ORG-9] pizza. And the [ORG-10], in case you are a vegetarian, you may prefer a pizza with pizza.
Agent: The [ORG-13] and Olives So having those insights for each and every user they were able to send those segmented very relevant on e to one hyper-personalized messages to you thereb y in creating the impact in your customer
EndUser: Ecosystem by increasing the ROI and thereby [PERSON-15] the personalized messages as well .
Agent: Got it.
Agent: So moving back to the beginning of the use case.
Agent: So essentially, in [ORG-1], what we envision as a customer experience or a successful customer experience is by keeping your customer at the center and thinking about all the different touch points he may have within your ecosystem.
Agent: Now that could be a [ORG-15], that could be a service platform where a person is making an inquiry or has some consumer complaints and thereby or complementing it with the Marketing ecosystem or the Marketing solutions where you can send all the different questions.
Agent: On the channel log just to your end consumers .
Agent: ?
Agent: Within [DATE-1]'s session, the scope of the demonstratio n we have kept is just the engagement platform , is the only channel platform where you can creat e or stitch consumer journeys and send thos e only channel log just on email SMS .
Agent: Up ?
Agent: Them via . [ORG-15], [ORG-15], [ORG-17], [ORG-15], [ORG-15], [PERSON-15], etc. Again, with engagement, the advertising that I spoke about, we have native connectivity with these different social platforms.
Agent: [PERSON-17] is the platform where if you want to create, let's say, a propensity of a person to buy, or if you want to create, you know, create segments which touches across various touch points of a customer.
Agent: For example, somebody is looking at the website. He has not purchased any previous orders from the end-your-group in the past.
Agent: Or is his propensity or what he ordered last time or the number of orders that he did last time on [NORP-1] were greater than two.
Agent: So in case you want to do those sophisticated use cases, then that is where customer data platform comes into picture. This is the one that is used by [ORG-4] and [GPE-7].
Agent: I think there's somebody who raised his hand .
Speaker 6: At the moment so [PERSON-15] when you say you have a native connectivity with the social media, what is the difference between a native connectivity and the normal connectivity?
Agent: Yeah,
Speaker 6: I mean, can we schedule our calendars and the automated postings can be done via this platform?
Agent: So what I mean by native connectivity is that for For example, you have a segment of people.
Agent: Let's say one of the use cases that I look at from the previous conversation, [PERSON-15] that you highlighted was, let's say an abandoned use case.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Somebody who abandoned a cart or people or another example could be that if you want to drive a significant traffic towards online delivery, right?
Agent: People who visited your restaurant in [DATE-3], maybe you want that, but you want to serve a act to those particular people.
Agent: Now, you can either send an email, you can send an SMS, what's up, or you can send them an [ORG-15].
Agent: Now, what that native connectivity allows you to do is that from this platform itself, you can take that segment and publish that.
Agent: Segment and that will be available on your social media and then you can define the creativ e and send that targeted act to those people.
Agent: What happens when you don't have a nativ e connectivity?
Agent: You will manually have to extract that segment in a file, then import it manuall y within your social ecosystem. And as the social ecosystem also increases the amount of huma n effort at your end .
Speaker 6: I hope that clarifies your question.
Agent: Yeah, so case of native also, I the social posting, the post and all I have to do.
EndUser: But still in
Speaker 6: Have to do
Agent: Man, right?
Agent: Yeah, I'm just a quick intervention here. So campaigns, creating campaigns, all of that will still happen at the respective platforms.
Speaker 6: All your social building campaigns,
Agent: I mean, well, please go because that's
EndUser: Their bread and butter. But are I also pushing
Agent: The audience whom that campaign that
Speaker 6: Do you want to show
Agent: Can be automated using a platform that can be mapped the mapping of the customer segmentation. Additional use case which are forcing your industries. Let's say you want to suppress a couple of people as well.
Agent: Maybe you're driving an awareness campaign and some people who have already visited your restaurant in [DATE-4]. Maybe you want to add a suppression audience on your ad campaign.
Speaker 6: That could be one key view. use case where you can effectively optimise
Agent: Your Marketing that spend as well . right okay
Agent: So, I'll keep moving on. We have a constant engagement, which is a [ORG-23] So, I'll ignore this one. In case you want to personalize your, let's say, digital properties, for example, somebody plans on your website.
Agent: You want to nudge them by giving them a relevant offer by what providing a [ORG-15] information, let's say, email or an SMS.
Agent: So, in defining those pop-ups or if somebody's looking at a [NORP-1] food or let's say he's looking at a restaurant and let's say he's looking at an area of cinema.
Agent: Before then customizing or personalizing those digital experiences is powered by personalization .
Agent: Case you're spending too much on your ads, right?
Agent: And you do not know which ads are drivin g the best performance then intelligence comes into picture.
Agent: If you want to create let's sa y different tiers of your loyalty program, define that in this platinum tier, I want to give the m these many points or on birthday, this is the offer I want to roll out to them.
Agent: So again , have a loyalty experience .
Agent: The idea is that while you can start with an engagement module and all of these are modular in natur e, but going forward as you scale, as your use case is also become way more sophisticated and complicate d, you don't have to go to another vendor, we are of all your Marketing CRM service need s.
EndUser: There for you, we'll take care
Agent: Okay, so with that I will delve right into the you know presentation.
Agent: So a couple of things what we have observed in terms of 10s is that, you know, of course, there are, while there are nudges that go to a lot of consumers in terms of email, SMS and what is up, they need to stay on the mind and not on the inbox itself.
Agent: So if somebody is looking at, let's say, [NORP-1] food and a message is going to him for a, you know, a wife, nami food, that may not resonate with your customers.
Agent: And we've seen a lot of brands struggling with that.
Agent: And that this is something which typically, happens when you take an email from another vendor, SMS from another vendo r and [ORG-21] from another vendor, right ?
Agent: You can see, silo channel is one of the common problems . then, you know, because your data is not, you know , moving between these channels, your email may tend t o communicate a very different message .
Agent: Sms may have a very different communication as well, right ?
Agent: That's the need for that same need of the are having all th e all the Marketing channels on one single platform .
Agent: With that in mind, would be also o n understood from you, you do want to look at how you can acquire your customers, keep existi ng ones, you know, engaged with your brand, how can you create highly personalized experienc es on scale on a one two one basis and thereby increasing your customer lifetime value a nd also having that impact of increase in the Marketing ROI within your ecosystem.
Agent: Now in order to solve for all these challenges, we propose a [PRODUCT-3] engagement solution. Now what it does for you is that you can import all your consumer data. You can create different segments on those people.
Agent: You can send those one-to-one personalized journeys. You can send emails, SMS, WhatsApp, or G-target them via channels. And as you can see on the right side, this is how a sample journey may look like for your customers.
Agent: And with that being said, this is very, very customizable. You can define your own customer journeys. You can define your own touch points. You can add different if-and-else conditions within your Marketing journeys.
Agent: Now in order to effectively look at how we are going to impact our customer journey, we're looking at, we are going to step into the shoes of [ORG-15] and she's a prospective customer.
Agent: Right now her wedding anniversary is about to come and she wants to celebrate it at a, you know, one of the pre-membré restaurants and she's currently in her in her browsing order. search state.
Agent: And at the back end, in order to ensure that [ORG-23] goes ahead and does that reservation with [ORG-21] and also increase our customer lifetime value, we have [PERSON-23] who is a very enthusiastic marketer who connects her entire journey through relevant [WORK_OF_ART-1] and again thereby drive higher customer lifetime value for her.
Agent: Now, one of the key use cases that are picked up is increasing customer loyalty whereby Sicha [DATE-5] randomly browsing over social media, she comes across the ad of [GPE-8].
Agent: Now what she does is she that acts Intrigues or so she clicks it looks at the restaurant and what are the dishes served at [ORG-21] group now what she does is she does send an inquiry and speaks to an agent but again we all live in a varied in a world which is full of digital restrictions, right?
Agent: Maybe our mothers are calling to check out a day go or, you know, our dogs are barking or our kids are calling us for something or the other, right?
Agent: So at this point of time, what you can do is retarget her with some only general communication. Maybe send an email or an SMS or a WhatsApp at this point of time.
Agent: In case she's not responsive on any of these channels, she's still not done a booking. Then you can retarget her via ads to not her further.
Agent: So, on [PERSON-15] here again, this is a very common use case that we got implemented for a lo t of key appliances For example, your email SMS and WhatsApp are comparatively cheaper and ads are comparativel y much more expensive start using email SMS and WhatsApp in the first go If there is no response, then you can go ahead and proceed to your ads as well .
Speaker 6: So you can Right?
Agent: Then you can go ahead, then she goes ahead and does a booking and at this point of time you can do a purchase, confirmation and recommendations or preferences, capture preferences for her even before she visits your restaurant.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Now on [DATE-6] of her appointment, all the reminders that are going on, timely reminders and then after her visit, maybe a post-visit feedback on how did, how was everything for her was everything in line with her expectation.
Agent: And then you can also keep her informed about different seasonal festival offers going on or the new restaurant launches that are happening group or the new dishes that are being launched.
Speaker 6: With the ninja
Agent: So the second use case that I've picked up is that is the driving online delivery sales whereby somebody is an existing customer. You can keep them informed about you know there's an online delivery section as well right.
Agent: This could be before people who have already you know done an online delivery from you in the past or people who have visited your restaurant and not made an online purchase right so what she does is as an end user she again goes to the website a [PERSON-21]'s in drop-off drops off at this point of time you can send them an SMS or a WhatsApp with an offer let's say you know welcome tent or seasonal 10 offer could be promo [LAW-1] can be given so that they can go ahead and make the purchase.
Agent: So she goes ahead and makes that purchase and this point of time you can trigger different purchase communications via only channels and then you can also keep them notified about different seasonal festival offers or food festival offers going on within your ecosystem.
Agent: That's a <inaudible> [EVENT-1] is about to come so you can keep what special are you doing within [DATE-7].
EndUser: Them informed about
Speaker 6: What is
Agent: So these are some of the key use cases that you can look at, but again, number of use cases that you can define are limitless, right?
Speaker 6: The
Agent: And all of them can be done with these particular lifecycle journeys that you can see here.
Agent: So Some of the journeys you can run for different consumer life cycle phases is during their awareness phase, their conversion, their onboarding engagement and the retention. So with that, I'll jump right
Speaker 6: Into the platform and just want to see in case you on a land resort, if you have any questions from me.
Speaker 6: Yeah, so at this stage, I have a question that regarding this use case says, for example, you gave these two examples. I wanted to understand how flexible is your system.
EndUser: That if I have a use case in my mind, so I can define that rule for the segmentation that flexibility is there, or I have to just follow the predefined set of rules which you have created for the segmentation and the filtration part.
Agent: Okay, there are so you know as you can see we work with a lot of Industries as well.
Agent: They have different use cases, right?
Agent: So the whole idea what [ORG-1] does is we give you a platform to play with right?
Agent: You can define your use cases. You can stitch your own journeys. It is very flexible and in terms of ease [GPE-9]. Have you played that Right, right.
Speaker 6: Game of legos when we were young?
Agent: Right. So it's as easy as that. And you are we are actually going to see how easy it is to create those journeys as well, which I'll actually, you
Speaker 6: Know, show it to your [TIME-2].
EndUser: Okay, [PERSON-15] and tell me one thing that whatever is the use cases, assume that we are not doing anything. We are not posting anything on our social medias or we are not running any ad.
EndUser: Will, will this system still works?
EndUser: So we just have on website and we Right after that, if we are not at all active, say for [DATE-8], we have zero, zero ads running either on social media or on [ORG-17] ads, or not a single post on any of our social media as assets handles.
Agent: Have in social media presence.
Agent: What will happen?
Agent: So essentially that is just one of the touch points that we have that you know one of the entry points that you can take from social media regardless of whether that traffic comes from social media or not you just need let's say a PII information for a you know end consumer if [NORP-2] sir if I want to reach out to you right like I need to know your phone number on this you know an email address for me being able to reach out to you.
Agent: So in case let's say another use case or an entry point would be that in your end consumer.
Agent: Restaurant itself, there's somebody who's capturing my phone number or an email A little bit, then you can create these your needs as well . Okay, we could somebody lose their hand.
EndUser: Got it.
Agent: I
Agent: No, I wish it was me only in country. Okay.
Agent: So with that, [PERSON-23], sir, and [PERSON-1], I will jump right onto the platform and we'll see how easy it is to create and stitch those journeys, right?
Agent: So this is the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Platform and this also summarizes the key capabilities within the platform itself, right?
Agent: So if you see here in [DATE-9], there are a couple of studios and there are a couple of builders. Now these studios are essentially the different channels via which you can reach your yoke in consumers.
Agent: That's your email. SMS, WhatsApp, different ad channels and also if you want to create any inquiry pages . these are these [NORP-3] different channels by which you can reach out your end consumers .
Agent: [ORG-15] is where we are going to create those one-on-one customer journeys and those if and students.
Agent: If you want to see reporting, then again those that are provided by the analytics and then you can create your WhatsApp email Content again within the platform.
Agent: And [PERSON-21], just like a super brainy scientist [PERSON-21], we have embedded AI within the platform which you can again use within your customer journeys.
Agent: And [PERSON-21]'s are also extending on the you know the previous query that you just asked that. you know another touch point could be using the inquiry pages.
Agent: So in case you do not hav e you do not do any social media targeting right and you have organic traffic flowing ont o your website.
Agent: If you want to create let's send and quiet page a first name last nam e what restaurant what day do you want to visit again you can create those these landing page s on the platform and host them within your website where once any you know once [PERSON-15] or aruship would that information like an email or an essay is you can use that information and start a lead nurturing journey for these particul ar people.
Agent: This is again just one sample cloud landing page. You can customize it, you c an add different attributes, you can add a different look and feel to it altogether as [PERSON-38] 6: So, [PERSON-4], here I understand that this
Agent: Is a Marketing engagement
EndUser: Platform which you are showing right now. Assuming that I have a system where I am doing my table reservation, people are doing the
Agent: Bookings there and
Speaker 6: I am getting the booking data in my back-hand system. So that system will be integrated
Agent: To this platform on a real-time basis, how it will So there are two ways of integration. So with [ORG-1], we are a very open ecosystem.
Agent: If you have a need to nurture some real-time information, not to go to those real-time journeys, we do have open APIs.
Agent: So as long as your source system can trigger an API call, we are able to receive it, we are able to handle it, and you can create a journey. That is one way.
Agent: In case you feel that API is not, let's say, on your source, there's a restriction on the API.
Agent: You can, let's say, export a flat file from there, put it in the SFTP and says , is very well capable of picking up files from the SFT P on a regular basis,
Agent: Thereby automating your entire process . So, in layman's term, yes, it can be in real-time if it is through API integration, if your system
Speaker 6: Allows API, then this can be integrated and it can be real time.
Agent: Got it, the real-time as well as the manual process of file based transfer.
Speaker 6: Got it. So, we have both the options, have a lot of data.
Agent: Correct, correct. Okay. So, we
Speaker 6: So, we have a lot of data. So, we have a lot of data. So, we have a lot of data. So, we have a
Agent: Lot of data. So, we have a lot of data. So I'm considering what elaborating on your question, how easy it is to create journeys or stitching those journeys.
Agent: We also, you know, now you can see there are a couple of, you know, symbols on the left side and on the right side, I have a white canvas, right?
Agent: Now we just go to in the game of legos.
Agent: What do we do?
Agent: We have different blocks. We have green color, yellow color. red and blue. You can see different colours. All you need to do is drag and drop them and configure your journeys.
Agent: Now also answering upon your what all data sources we can look at.
Agent: One could be you already have some existing customers, right?
Agent: You want to send an urgent journey to so you can use a data extension activity. In case you already have a booking system, you want to do some real-time journeys. A pair event can be used for that.
Agent: In case you have any of you want to nurture people who have sent in [ORG-38]-D on your website and in [ORG-38]-E form, which is looked at [TIME-3] back, you can utilize the cloud pages activity.
Agent: So the options are limitless. All you need to do is, you know, just identify where your source data is like. who you want to send a journey to.
Agent: So for the sake of the session, I'm just using a data extension activity.
EndUser: Next So this configuration of the journey is taken care by your team or my team.
Agent: Would be that.
Agent: So this configuration of the journey essentially again, all you need to do is identify the use cases that you want And there'll be a one-time Implementation that will be done, you know, after you sign up for this instance, wherein our Implementation partner will come in, they will do an extensive discovery for you that, you know, these are the [PERSON-1] and [ORG-21], so these are the use cases that you want to do.
Speaker 6: To do, right?
Agent: From their experience also, they will act as advisory that in this industry, these are some additional use case s that we are seeing or from a different industry , some use cases, which may be very relevan t for your industry .
Agent: Is what you can also start experimenting with . they can also guide you in that particular way . they'll set these journeys up for you . set up these different data Integration point s as well .
Agent: Then on an operational level , and until you want to change a creativ e or you want to add more journeys , then majorly I've seen customers getting into the platfor m.
Speaker 6: Okay, okay.
Agent: So then on kit let's say you want to send an email WhatsApp.
Agent: Or an SMS, right?
Agent: And then let's say an ad campaign as well, to, on maybe [ORG-17] or [ORG-15], right?
Agent: One of the use cases could be that you may want to add a decision that maybe somebody is looking at a restaurant in Little [GPE-2] whereas somebody who is looking at a restaurant in another location of [GPE-3] or [GPE-2] or you know, [GPE-10] or [GPE-13], right?
Agent: So this decision let essentially acts as an if and else condition within your Marketing journeys there by helping you to effectively segment your consumer database.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Then you can also utilize this engagement with activity. Now essentially what this helps you to do is that in case somebody has opened this email, maybe you can continue nurturing them on email.
Agent: If they have not, then maybe you can send them a WhatsApp. Now this effectively helps you in optimizing your Marketing spend because email is the most cheapest form of channel.
Agent: Whatsapp costs a little more and if you add ads, right?
Agent: Add is the most expensive form of channels. So you can optimize your... Marketing spend as well from here . In case you want to increase your email engagement rate, you can utilize [PERSON-21] as well.
Agent: Now, here what happens is that, for example, [PERSON-26] are open his emails at [TIME-4], and [ORG-26], you generally check to prefer in the afternoon, maybe around 1am, right?
Agent: So while you both are a part of this segment, this email will land in the [ORG-21]'s inbox at [TIME-4] when he has previously engaged with a brand. And in your inbox at [TIME-5]Agent: When you have engaged with a brand on a one two one level right if I'm an [PERSON-21] also added even ou r Preferences will be added in this journe y Then you can also utilize this frequency split now your what also does happen o r What is also very common in the Marketing world is that there are too many Marketing messages sent t o You know your end consumers if you want to define that saturation that if so many messages have gone t o If too many messages have [NORP-4] t to you [PERSON-26] a particular individual, if you want to end their journey, if not, then maybe you want to continue their journey.
Agent: So for that frequency spec is used. And then if you want to utilize the likelihood of a person to open this particular channel, even before sending that Marketing communication, then you can also utilize this scoring split.
Agent: What is the likelihood of this person opening an email?
Agent: What is there a likelihood?
Agent: If there's a likelihood, then you send them an email. If not, then maybe you can move them on a WhatsApp or, you know, Noise detection . So, here you can just see a user email open state.
Agent: So here if something is likely to open an email, send them an email. If he's not likely to open an email, send them a WhatsApp or an [ORG-15] or an SMS. So you can effectively do those these things.
Agent: And, what you may have noticed still now is I've not written even a single line of [PRODUCT-4] or [ORG-26] or any code. It is a drag and drop query that I'm doing.
Agent: And in future, if you think there's a need for you to, let's say, user sales for [PRODUCT-1] or a service cloud, then you also have native connectivity with these platforms if you want to create a need for somebody to call up, you know, for a sales agent to pursue or you want to create a task for a service agent.
Agent: So again, we have a native connectivity, but these are activated
Speaker 6: Or enabled if you do buy sales, sales, the [PRODUCT-1] or the service platform. Okay, so for this communication channels as a part of these workflows like email or a WhatsApp.
Agent: So you have your in house platforms to broadcast the data. So these are run natively on the [ORG-1] platform.
Agent: We are our own ESP and in terms of WhatsApp, we have a strategic direct partnership with meta, which means you can create your WhatsApp business account on the platform. You can create your templates as well.
Agent: You can get your approvals from the platform itself.
Agent: Also with the intermediary because again speaking to a lot of clients and a lot of client ecosystems, what happens when there's a third party, what's a provider is that there's a blame game that my templates are not getting approved or the price is also 10 to increase because every vendor in between have their own commissions.
Agent: So thereby there are advantages that we have by having that strategic partnership with [ORG-38].
EndUser: So your package is inclusive of these communication price as well, like the platforms, right?
EndUser: There's no separate charges for the transaction
Agent: Based on the number of transaction or something. [PERSON-1], the way we price our platform is again very modular in nature.
Agent: We have a base platform price, right?
Agent: And then we have a consumable price that with the place platform some emails which are bundled for free in terms of how many message, how many SMS you want to say, how many WhatsApp you want to say, which is very similar to how we used to have those, you know, mobile prepaid that there was there was a lifetime value or a and then we had a top-time price, we have value.
Speaker 6: So this is exactly how it is priced as well. Okay, understand. Okay.
Agent: So any questions on how this journey is created either from [ORG-25] or [PERSON-38] I think it's till now it's fine for me.
EndUser: Sir?
Agent: So, [ORG-26], I've created some sample journeys.
Agent: Again, this is, as you saw, that this is a very customizable tool, right?
Agent: You don't have to follow the use cases exactly that I'm showing. You can create your own journeys. You can create your use cases and it is very easy to define these journeys on the basis of use cases.
Agent: The first use case that I've taken is somebody who comes on a website and abandons this card. At this point of time, what you can do is you can send an offer-based [ORG-21] or an offer-based email.
Agent: And then you can see in... case after a while again this is customized into th e way in case after a while person has made a purchase or not .
Agent: He's already made a purchase end his journey if he is not , you can send him other recommendations or other [ORG-25] n Code right and in case not then you can .
Agent: In case there's any other offer that is relevant for that particular person or any other recommendations that are there.
Agent: If you still want to do further nurturing, maybe you can send in targeted ad campaign to those people as well.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 6: And we will have all those typical statistics of the email email, right?
Speaker 6: Like open rate and click rate and all those things will be there, right?
Agent: Yes, that will be there.
Agent: The second one is the second journey that I have is let's say you want to keep people informed about the festival offer or New additions that you are doing within your menu now here You can see that in case somebody has an interest of let's say [PERSON-25] Then you can send them an [NORP-1] specific Email in case you want to keep them informed that you know there's a new addition Let's say you add some [GPE-15] you will run dishes within your menu like a kachapa or anarapa right so you can confirm them that you know these are new additions that we are doing or in terms of there's a new restaurant launch as well so that's another use case that you can look at that you know the previous maybe you also want to keep them informed that there's a new branch opening and this area of the city as well right yeah Right?
Speaker 6: Customers who visited this restaurant
Agent: And then you can also do path, you know, AB testing in terms of if you want to test different creatives right on your email, which whichever is having a higher open or an engagement rate that goes out to the remaining audience.
Agent: For example, if you have 102 people to 10 you send a version A to 10 you send a version B after a while you check out of version A and version B, which was the winning creative and then to 62 people
Speaker 6: The winning creative course. So you can do those.
Agent: You know, those you can also explore these features within the tool .
EndUser: Right, right, right. So coming to the creative, sorry, I was there a question.
EndUser: I was just, I just forgot what I was about to ask.
EndUser: So my question is whatever I have seen right now, you have defined one journey and all at the starting point or some data source, right?
EndUser: That data source would be the real-time API based thing or a flat file based thing.
EndUser: Now my question is this is about, this is we are doing, we are playing with whatever customers who have consumed my service and they have profiled
Speaker 6: Now, any feature which can expose us to external people who have not consumed our audience in the open market.
Agent: Service, but they are relevant target provision?
Speaker 6: Do we have any such
Agent: Are you talking about local-like audiences?
Agent: Maybe something like that, yeah, correct. Okay, so we do have that, but that's only applicable within the [ORG-15] ecosystem, with at least in this particular platform or this particular module that we are talking about.
Agent: So we do have something known as, for example, you identified these are your high value customers in that segment, and you want, you publish that segment to [ORG-15], and then you can do a lookalike audiences as well from here.
Agent: The [GPE-1] module, if you remember that we talked about the customer data platform with a data cloud.
Agent: With that, We even have extensive partnerships with [ORG-17] platform So if you want to do local likes within [ORG-17] ecosystem that can be done They even give you insights, such as these are the peopl e who are night lovers or coffee lovers .
Agent: Or you know, like life enthusiasts or sports club fanatics. So from the [ORG-17] ecosystem, you also publish
Speaker 6: Those insights, but that is again applicable within the [GPE-1] or the Data Cloud module. So that is a totally
Agent: Kind of a paid ad kind of a thing or it is something organic also out of it.
EndUser: Paid ad paid at an organic ad as in the local likes. let's say under I take your [ORG-52] module also under my package.
EndUser: There the [ORG-17] tells me that okay based on this filter criteria, we have found these one like segmented people.
EndUser: After that, what happens?
EndUser: What do I do?
EndUser: I mean, do I have to ultimately the action is to
Agent: Go for a [ORG-17] ad paid ad campaign or your system has some other actions also on there. So essentially again, when we talk about, I'll get out.
Agent: Segregate into a couple of parts what you've asked in terms of the [ORG-15] look alike when we look at just the product that is currently in scope which is the engagement module right what it does allow you is that you know there are hundred people identify the local likes for these people now that look alike happens on the [ORG-15] ecosystem so what essentially [ORG-15] is doing is it is only defining a segment for you The pricing or the ad campaign, you know, the ads that the ad spend that has to be done is to be within the [ORG-15] ecosystem.
Agent: So here it just that customer segmentation.
Speaker 6: Helps you redefine or define Okay.
Agent: Okay. And in terms of answering your question on the [ORG-17] ecosystem, which is within the [PRODUCT-5] module, what happens with [ORG-17] or [ORG-15] or [ORG-21], there is, I believe [ORG-21] would not be much of relevance to you.
Agent: But what happens with [ORG-17] ecosystem, there is that let's say there are 113 people, that's your high value customers who have also looked at your, who have also browsed your website in [DATE-3], but not made any purchase, right?
Agent: You create that segment, you publish that segment on [ORG-17] ecosystem, it does. then share those insights with you.
Agent: Now on that you can also do a local-lik e audiences but again that just constructs a segment for you the publishing of th e ad or the pricing of how you have to do that is that is that i s something that is done directly or from your from your back right .
Speaker 6: To [ORG-17]
Agent: Because essentially this is bare
Speaker 6: Bread and butter. We just help you redefine or refine your targeting criteria. Understand the strength. So the ultimately the action is like, is going towards the paid campaigns
Agent: Ultimate action with these platforms. That's what I wanted once and think I'm fine. Yeah, please go ahead.
Agent: So it depends on your strategy in terms of I mean what we propose or what we suggest is make use of all your channels, only channel targeting which means email SMS WhatsApp where they are not effective that's a pure solely your decision.
Speaker 6: And also maybe moving to ads as well but
Agent: I want to move towards that. I got it, I got it here.
Agent: It's just that they are living in a very social world so with a lot of social presence, right?
Agent: Definitely. Yes, yes. Sorry guys, sorry to interrupt. I have another meeting I'll have to jump off.
Agent: I think [PERSON-4] can conclude the meeting and unk it once you have gone through the platform, you can give your feedback to [PERSON-4], I'll collect the same from her.
Agent: And then I'll send out a email to you asking for certain volumes
Speaker 6: Or volume metrics.
EndUser: Once you respond in the position to table the first draft of proposal with you.
Agent: To that email, that's when I'll be
EndUser: Sure, that's it. Thank you. All right. Thanks.
Agent: Thanks, [PERSON-1]. Thanks, [PERSON-25]. Thanks for being here. Thanks for bringing
Speaker 6: The bye-bye. Thanks for the bye-bye.
Agent: Any other questions, [PERSON-1], that I may take?
Agent: No, no, no. So you can go ahead. OK.
Agent: So, in case you can also create your [PRODUCT-6] within the platform which means let's say you can create your emails again this is something that I've created on the platform itself in case you want to let's say host any host any images or add any images within your platform let's say I can upload one of the images that I've just taken.
Agent: I think the format is not valid for this one. I just use the pre-existing one. It looks like the format does not write. So this is one image that I've already created. And I click on anything.
Agent: And then if you want to add let's say certain [WORK_OF_ART-1] within your platform, you know, text or buttons again, these are just simple drag and drops.
Agent: If you want to create if and else within your Marketing content, that if a person has previously ordered [NORP-1], maybe a picture of a pasta goes out.
Agent: If a person has ordered <inaudible> or he's a vegetarian, then vegetarian options go out as new launches in the new launch email, right?
Agent: And then you can also create email forms within the email address.
Agent: For example, a review, what was the feedback of a person?
Agent: Again, this is your customisable. You can change the fields, you can change the headers, you can change.
Agent: The look and feel you can also create a preferences within your email what is your preferred Your food are you looking at an <inaudible> are you a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?
Agent: Are you preference in <inaudible> or a [NORP-5] or a <inaudible>?
Agent: So you can create those preferences and then you can store these are also stored in the back end and then you can utilize them in your further communication is communication as well Then we also have a direct partnership with [ORG-36].
Agent: So you can create your WhatsApp business account on the platform. You can create the WhatsApp templates as well. You can create these journeys which we looked at by.
Agent: And then you can also create these sort of templates on the platform, the Marketing and the transactional ones. You can add rich media capabilities within WhatsApp images, videos, documents and also buttons.
Agent: And if you want to add first name personalization or a food personalization, what are they?
Agent: Restaurant may impose the like this and you have an upcoming appointment with restauran t at mini [GPE-2] right you can add thos e Of course, there are actually coaches, but... Now moving on to the reporting section as well.
Agent: Now even within reporting, you can get these dashboards which can show what was the again, you can redefine or refine on the basis of certain date ranges or a clamping or a journey or a business unit as well.
Agent: So another key thing that I want to highlight is that right now understand that you're looking only for a business unit, but for a for a you know, a restaurant unit, but in case actually you want to expand it to other businesses.
Agent: As well. We have the probability of creating those <inaudible> walls,
Speaker 6: Which means you can ad d different business units and create those data segregations within business units. S o we have very scalable that way . So [PERSON-4], one question here,
Agent: For example, right now
EndUser: We are a group, we are as an engine group, we are a company under which we are having multiple business units.
EndUser: So, when we purchase the account with you, we can add multiple business units under that account or we need to buy every time new account with you.
Agent: So essentially if you do plan to scale it for multiple business, you know, I'll just speak it speak on the back end with [PERSON-7] as well.
Agent: You don't need to purchase different, you know, you all you need to whenever you're signing up for a new business, you know, because that will also have their own journeys that will also have their own consumables.
Agent: So essentially you don't have to pay and you know, like a platform cost again and again, but within one single ecosystem, you can have multiple business.
EndUser: You can have different journeys, you can have different datasets, you can have differen t creatives which are also not visible to another business unit .
EndUser: Okay, I mean, and when I'm saying adding a new business unit, food domain only because for example, our [PERSON-2] brand is having four sub restaurant units under [GPE-3].
Agent: I'm talking within the
Agent: The brand the menus might be a little different and but the physical locations are different, but the brand is saving.
Speaker 6: Is same. The
Agent: Can you?
Agent: That way.
Agent: So we do give you that flexibility that if you want to create them, you know, a different business unit wise, or you can even create a folder structure and you know, within folder structure, you can organize it that way as well.
Agent: So let's say when I talk about a business unit segregation, usually the segregation that I've seen is that somebody is dealing on let's say a four-unit or you know, along with that they're also in real estate.
Agent: If you look at [ORG-37] right there, it improves so many different business units. this unit they are into, you know , there are into retail, there are into restaurants, there are
EndUser: Into multi-brant, bazaars as well. So that is the logical segregation
Agent: That I've seen. But we do review that flexibility however you want to define it. Okay.
Agent: So, on case in terms of reporting, these are some of the sample reports that you can see the open grids, you can see the cent rate, the bounce rates, you can see how the sense delivers unique open conflicts work, which journeys are performing very well for you, which journeys are not performing well for you.
Agent: So, that you can take corrective actions on these journeys. And then we also have the [PRODUCT-7] inside, so the [PRODUCT-7] dash coding capability. We summarize the [PRODUCT-7] in size space on our consumer behavior.
Agent: So you can see which all customers or which segment of your customer are opening your Marketing communications, which all are literally not opening your Marketing communications.
Agent: Then you can also see which are very engaging days within your consumer database here.
Agent: You can see the longest part of our [DATE-10] and [DATE-13], which means these are very... popular days among your consumer database, right?
Agent: If you want to see that on an R&D level So if you remember, we talked about [PERSON-52] opening his emails at [TIME-4] and you at [TIME-6] If you want to see at a holistic level, which is very popular among your consumer database you already can see the longest part is one .
Agent: So this is also something that you can be inside also something which are available within the platform. Then you can also get an understanding on how much is a saturation of marketing, communications within your consumer base.
Agent: And people receiving not enough amount of communications aren't already receiving a lot of communication. So you can end their journey. This is exactly something which we also used in the journey building module.
Agent: Then we were creating these journey, these blue activities, if you want to see those on a holistic level, that is something that we are creating. what a dashboard right now .
Agent: And then you can also get insights on which subject lines are doing well for you.
Agent: And what is the insight in terms of the emotional tone?
Agent: For example, if you have an exclamation mark, there is having a positive impact on an engagement rate. If you have love, words like, you know, love or optimism, they are having a positive impact.
Agent: If you have surprise as an element in terms of tonality, that's having a negative impact within your Marketing channel. So you can get these insights as well on an AI level. Again, these are more.
Agent: Detailed [PRODUCT-7] dashboards for your consumer database on how they are behaving on your Marketing communications Are they opening everything Are they not opening everything This is the dominant window . shop person, active subscriber and the loyal list one.
Agent: This is again on a saturation. This is again a detailed dashboard for, yeah, you can see all these insights on database.
EndUser: Your consumer
Agent: Any things from
Speaker 6: Your side on [PERSON-21] and [PERSON-36]?
Agent: It's clear. It's quite clear. Okay. Moving back to the presentation. We've already discussed about the consumer stories. So coming back to you also asked about the difference between [ORG-1] and our Competition here.
Agent: So this is what we have collated that again as you saw on [ORG-38], we on one channel you can create those omni-channel experiences, which means you can add email SMSs, WhatsApp and even retarget people via different channels.
Agent: We are not working with, you know, send grid for our emails, right?
Agent: We also have a direct native connectivity with [PRODUCT-1] or the service platform in case you do want to leverage that in future.
Agent: Usually what we have seen is that as you scale your demands also, your software needs also become more sophisticated, more complex.
Agent: So for handling those complex uses, if you ever do need a [PRODUCT-1], you don't have to go to another vendor. We have those native connectivity.
Agent: With respect to WhatsApp, we have a direct partnership with [ORG-40], which means that you can create your platforms. your WhatsApp business account and your templates within the platforms .
Agent: The [PRODUCT-7] capabilities that we have in terms of, you know, channel a person is likely to engage on the same time optimization, subject line optimization.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Again, these are natively available within the platform. You can also create different business units for different geographies or different, you know, businesses as well.
Agent: In case you have some restaurants in [GPE-2], you want to create a different [ORG-47] for it. Restaurants for [GPE-3], another business unit for it. Restaurants in [GPE-13], another business unit for it.
Agent: Then in terms of learning, we have something similar to Udemy We have [ORG-52] This is a free learning platform in case you do want to, in case you want your team want s to basically enhance your knowledge on different solutions Again, this is a free learning site that we have We do have a vast experience in food tech industry as well And again, in terms of architecture, you can create multiple business units You can do a synchronization between the same We still not provide so many things in one of thoseips to make us face ourselve s. And we do release three innovations in [DATE-15].
Agent: Within [DATE-15], we have three releases in which we keep on adding lots and lots of features every time. So this is what we,
EndUser: This is why we are superior to our Competition in the industry. And while doing all this communication to my customers, is it a pure,
Agent: Wide-label thing or sales force branding is mentioned somewhere in those communications?
Agent: We give you that capability that it goes out through your brand. So there will be a branding established for you during the Implementation phase where there will be a definition that this is coming from [GPE-15].
Agent: These are the labels, the templates that you looked at, the email template, even if you look at it. I had customized it with [GPE-15]. So it's the only customized symbol you can put your own branding.
Speaker 6: And of course, it has to be your branding. It doesn't have to be sales first branding at all.
Agent: Ok.
Agent: And in terms of why [ORG-1], again, we have a unified customer platform. We have a whole customer, in case you do want to add someday, create different loyalty programs at different tiers.
Agent: You can see we have a different solution for it. The [ORG-37] again, we have identified that as your use cases start becoming more sophisticated.
Agent: If you want to create propensities for each and every customer, combine consumer data from multiple sources, create your own game. those look alike from [ORG-17] as well.
Agent: Then we have the whole Customer329 within our ecosystem In terms of reliability and scalability, you can see we are working with some of the larges t clients like [ORG-52]. We are working with [GPE-15].
Agent: [ORG-37] also signed up with us recently. We are als o globally working with [PRODUCT-8] and we are working with [ORG-55] . So these are some key logos that we are working with in the industry.
Agent: And there's again a. built in [PRODUCT-7] as well as intelligence. We are also another key use case that we're doing within [GPE-1] right now is also related to the generator [PRODUCT-7].
Agent: So you can do natural language segmentation that get me people who visited my restaurant in [DATE-3] and have not done an online delivery. So that's something currently within [GPE-1].
Agent: But again, you've seen the whole [PRODUCT-7] as well that is embedded within the platform.
Speaker 6: So, it is the management module can be do the multi-lingual
Agent: Email communication or WhatsApp communication like in <inaudible> or so?
Speaker 6: If you can do the multi-lingual
EndUser: Communication that is there. [NORP-6] you have mentioned a very big names [ORG-55], F1
Agent: Formalizing which is the smallest brand you guys are working with.
EndUser: Sir, we are working. Sorry, sorry you were saying something.
EndUser: What is the smallest brand, right?
EndUser: A company which is having 1 or 2 million of turnover early.
Agent: Do you have any such companies in your portfolio?
Agent: Sir, we are working with smaller companies as well. It's not only just the big, big locals. We are working with companies of all scales and all sizes.
Agent: In [GPE-2] also, we are working with, let's say, let's say, in [GPE-2], we are working with the companies.
Agent: We are working with [ORG-52] which is an agency which is a very small footprint of [ORG-1] which you may not even have heard of.
Agent: And then we also have a couple of, actually we're working with a couple of startups as well in [GPE-2].
EndUser: Let me open up.
EndUser: How much time suppose if we manage 4 of our out of 7, if we manage 4 of our restaurants with [ORG-1], right?
EndUser: How much time either on [ORG-38] or me or somebody from our Marketing team
Agent: Would be investing on day to day basis?
Agent: Sir, in terms of your timing on 4 restaurants, essentially
EndUser: Your Implementation will be done by the partner. You don't have to do this implementation.
EndUser: No, after the Implementation we are talking about the day to day basis, right?
EndUser: Once the Implementation is done, does everything is done and after that is not required for us to do anything or on day to day how much time a technical person are required or a
Agent: One marketer is required to maintain the systems. So it can literally be [TIME-7] as well, because everything is automated once that setup is done.
Agent: Unless and until you want to add more campaigns, more journeys, you want to change your creatives.
Agent: A marketer doesn't have to log in or create or launch these journeys, because once we've set it up, all you do is click on activate and it keeps on running on an automated basis.
Agent: So usually from my experience, I've seen usually most of the brands running around 5 to 7 journeys on a regular basis.
Agent: Unless an athlete, for example, you may have <inaudible> [DATE-15], but because <inaudible> [EVENT-1] is coming somewhere on [DATE-15] in [GPE-3].
Agent: So if you want to do, let's say, one of stand-alone campaign for it, which you may not have accounted for during the initial implementation, only that is something that you need to create. Otherwise, all your
EndUser: Awareness journeys. are onboarding journeys or post-visit journeys, usually these are accounted for so you don' t have to maintain them . Okay.
Agent: And how much time is required to set up the systems with is required to set up a system on the on the first time. It can vary anywhere from [DATE-17] to [DATE-15] depending on the use cases.
Agent: There will also be a time, this also accounts for the time where the partner, you know, partner team effectively interacts with you, with [PERSON-1] and your Marketing ecosystem, Marketing team in order to identify that these are the use cases that you want to solve.
Agent: These are the integrations you want to do. These are the journeys that you want to do.
EndUser: And also the training, this also includes the training. that once they're.. . implemented everything they will also train your team or that these journeys have been created. You got it.
Agent: Yeah please go ahead yeah. So [PERSON-37] this is our [PERSON-1] that's it from my site.
EndUser: Would just love to hear from you in terms of your feedback did you think this was relevant to you this was a valuable use of your time. Yes, yes, definitely just quite relevant to what we are looking for.
EndUser: I think, see, we are a non-IT company, right?
EndUser: We are into food business.
EndUser: So here everything under IT is counted or compared against ROI, right?
EndUser: What is the return over investment out of whatever we are doing?
EndUser: So definitely we have the capability to onboard [ORG-1] for our business needs in terms of budget and all. But the only thing is we need to analyze that what is the return of our investment.
EndUser: How it's going to be beneficial for our business. That is the decision point for us.
EndUser: So I would say I would suggest that if you can bring out the proposal in a way that it initially should not be very heavy right from the from the pricing point of view and gradually we can expand to a
Agent: Lot of level.
EndUser: Features we can use at the next
Agent: Sure, it will definitely be priced that way. But that's why we, for example, in the same way. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, [ORG-52].
Agent: So, that's why we identify that to begin with start with an engagement module later on.
Agent: I'm sure that we've seen a lot of customers wanting to run those propensities or even a malgomated [PRODUCT-7] models they're running on a [PRODUCT-9] or a [ORG-17] vertex [PRODUCT-7]. So you can do those within [GPE-1] as well.
Agent: Again, essentially these run towards a little bit more complex and sophisticated use cases. But if that is something that interests you, you want to do that within your ecosystem, that's what we're looking for.
EndUser: I'll do something . which is doable. So start with the engagement, which is one of the modules and then move on to others as well.
EndUser: [PERSON-38], if we just want to use say the the males and the WhatsApp communication in the beginning, I am not interested in any other functionalities of the of the system.
EndUser: We will have our own database of around 86,000 emailers and around 47 to 52,000 of the mobile numbers. If we have to just use these two functionalities,
Agent: Will it still require the same time to set up and will the cost will be still be the same or there will be a differences?
Agent: Sir, in terms of, you know, channel again, in terms, so the way we price, you know, I understand that you don't want to use S for example, if you don't want to use SMS or ad campaigns, that does have an impact on the cost but it will not be a very significant cost as well.
Agent: In terms of Implementation also because a lot of logic also goes in, you know, embedding or integrating your data from the different source systems and creating these journey. So essentially in them, there's a little bit effort.
EndUser: That will be reduced, it will not be a very significant effort, but effectively in term s of course . course there will be some reduction there.
EndUser: And what will be the results in achieving the numbers, right?
EndUser: Significantly, this will be a very significantly impacted in acquiring new customers or targeting
Agent: The existing customers or wouldn't it be?
Agent: Sir, it would be. That's why a lot of our customers are still working with us. [ORG-4] is still offline. Myindra and myindra is there.
Agent: It effectively, if you, if you, you know, for example, let's say you go for a shopping with your, with your family, right?
Agent: You're looking for a jeans and somebody is giving you an offer for a shirt again and again.
Agent: You'd not be interested unless and until it is what you are looking for that's served to you, that offer is served to you. Of course you'll not go ahead and make that purchase.
Agent: So exactly that also happens with your customer. If I'm looking for a, let's say I'm a, I'm a vegetarian. So a lot of times if somebody says, you're. non-vegetarian food
EndUser: Option. I will not go ahead and you know be interested towards it . Got it. Thank you.
Speaker 7: Yeah, I think it seems good.
Speaker 7: [PERSON-1], you have any more questions?
Speaker 7: I think I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. Yeah.
Agent: So, yeah, [PERSON-4] will just wait for your proposal now. Sure. So, on case in terms of next steps, what I'm going to do is I will just send up a follow-up email in terms of the volumetric.
Agent: Based on those volumetric, we'll go ahead and, you know, sort of, you know, the proposal as well. And also, what a call out since [DATE-15] is an [DATE-23] for salesforce.
Agent: So, we do have some, you know, discount offers running
EndUser: Only for [DATE-15] as of now. So, something you can leverage. Yes, that was discussed. So, but yeah, this was discussed in the last call that [ORG-1] follows the [GPE-4] here, [DATE-15].
EndUser: So, that's why the entry end is the their financial year end.
EndUser: So, that's why are able to close at a deal, we'll get these benefits.
Agent: Within [DATE-21], if you
EndUser: If we can close this ASAP, if the proposal will have the ROI mentioned against as well, against the cost.
EndUser: Say if you'll be charging a [DATE-15] offset [MONEY-1], so what exactly the results to us against [MONEY-2]?
EndUser: If that way the proposal will be created is much easier for us to decide faster because that's only the constraint right that if I'm spending in [MONEY-1] in marketing, well this will give me a result of [MONEY-3] worth of venue generation This is my the minimum benchmarking always.
Agent: Or not.
EndUser: Whatever a dollar is spent on marketing, if you give me a five times of revenue, I'm perfectly fine to go ahead with any marketing, any types
Agent: Of tools to increase the revenue. Sir, what we do have some industry benchmarks that, you know, in similar industry, what we've seen by implementing
EndUser: These solutions, so we can send those stats to you. Perfect.
EndUser: Do you have any such numbers in here means is upon in your hand right now that in [ORG-7] what exactly the numbers you guys are working with over the numbers you have created for any [ORG-7] businesses.
Agent: Which is not based in [GPE-2] not based in [GPE-2] outside the [GPE-2]. Outside [GPE-2] if I look at.
Agent: So and [ORG-54] coffee for example, they had [PERCENT-1] increase in newsletter signups in [DATE-23].
EndUser: This bitties
Agent: In terms of ROI, so I can check and get back to you. I think I don't have anything handy but I'll get back to you. And also in terms of the
EndUser: Small logos that we are working with.
EndUser: I suggest that when you will do your proposal, give me a number, not on signing the newsletters or customer engagements and all those type of theoretical things if there can be a revenue based that can be good enough.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: And our price point in terms of consumer spending, you have to assume is [MONEY-4] per consumer on a per visit is spending. to [MONEY-5]
Agent: Per consumer per time.
Agent: And how many consumers do you have
EndUser: On a [DATE-15] basis?
Agent: Currently it varies from restaurant to restaurant.
EndUser: It means it can be used. On an average, if we talk about an average, if we talk about an register, lunch is around 21 to 47 guests. Right in dinner is around the similar for the register.
EndUser: And which is only we are fulfilling is [PERCENT-2] of our capacity.
Agent: [PERCENT-3] of our
EndUser: So we still have an scope of adding doubling these numbers.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: And if we talk about the biggest outlet, which is the [FAC-1], but that is too new, we just started in [DATE-21], which is hitting capacity of 526 packs at any time.
EndUser: So launch, we are doing around 52. We have an scope of going another 141 to 172 packs in a launch. Currently within one is around 47 to 52 in a launch and around 21 plus in a dinner.
Agent: And [DATE-21], we are getting
EndUser: So dinner, we have a more scope. Okay. And this is all is a buffet, buffet
Agent: For a breakfast lunch and breakfast is definitely is part of the hotel tie up we are doing around 470 plus. Okay. Sure sir.
Agent: I've noted these stats and we'll send you some industry in terms of this is the monitoring pack which our customers have seen in this particular industry.
EndUser: Benchmarks where in terms of ROI
Speaker 8: Perfect.
Speaker 9: Sure, so that's may want to add on?
Agent: It for my site. Anything else that you I didn't know. Thank
Speaker 10: You. Thank you. Thank you.
Agent: Thank you. I'll show you any details as well.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"* The sales rep could have done a better job of directly addressing the customer's concern about return on investment (ROI) by providing specific industry benchmarks or examples of how other similar businesses have seen an increase in revenue after implementing the product.

The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the right decision maker was on the call or to identify the correct person if they were not.

3. ""And also... followed by a product demonstration on how easy it is to stitch all of this together how you can create those one-to-one customer experiences, right, in order to redefine their journey.""
4. ""So just a quick glimpse of what we'll cover in [DATE-2]. Although [PERSON-7] is already spoken about the different solutions, which are a fitment for the project group.""

video_19789_167_6qr3y000000g3AAAAY,"Agent: Spend some time, push and record. Spend some time [DATE-1] telling you a little bit about One, sales force at large and why we think we'd be a good partner for your organization.
Agent: And then going a little bit more specific into what we've heard from you so far in the direction that we think we're headed as far as the licensing is concerned.
Agent: And so this is more an opportunity for us to share with you and for you to ask questions, right?
Agent: Like dig in, Ask us, you know, what do you clarify [PERSON-1]?
Agent: What the heck are you talking about, right?
Agent: Let's make sure that we all leave [DATE-1]'s call, you know, kind of level set on the same page.
Agent: Does that make sense for [DATE-1]?
Agent: Yeah, that's great. Awesome. And I did hear from our team that we've gotten some survey results back. And so keep those coming in and we'll be able to in a future call kind of review those together. Great. Awesome.
Agent: Okay, I'm gonna go ahead. And start my slide show and share my screen.
Agent: And we'll dig into it here.
Agent: Can you see my screen now?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Okay, cool.
Agent: All right, so what are we talking about [DATE-1]?
Agent: We're going to talk about how we can work together in a partnership to help you all collaborate internally, build strong programs that lead to funding delivering those programs and measuring your impact.
Agent: So that you can report back to those funders, right?
Agent: It's kind of like that loop, right?
Agent: Of strong programs with strong deliverables, with strong reporting lead to strong ability to ask for additional funding lead to more strong programs, right?
Agent: And that's kind of what we're going to be talking through here [DATE-1].
Agent: Before we dig into that, this is [DATE-2] for [ORG-1]. This is our our [DATE-3] conference called [ORG-2]. Do not try to read this. I will send this as follow up.
Agent: Our [DATE-3] conference called [ORG-2], which essentially takes over the city of [GPE-1] and [PERSON-2] here and [PERSON-3] are both going to be attending over [DATE-4], is happening.
Agent: During [ORG-2] we make [QUANTITY-1] of announcements, right, about exciting new innovations on our solutions. This is our fore-looking statement. This essentially says, hold your horses.
Agent: What's else similar for a second?
Agent: Make purchasing decisions based upon solutions that are currently available, right?
Agent: This is our, hey, we don't wanna over promise and under deliver to you statement.
Agent: Make sense?
Agent: Everybody agree?
Agent: All right, we can blow through that then. All right, agenda. All right, let's talk about [ORG-1].
Agent: Who is [ORG-1]?
Agent: Why do we exist in the world?
Agent: Why do we think we're a good partner for your organization?
Agent: We're going to flow directly into a single source of truth, [PRODUCT-1], right?
Agent: A place where you can house and store all of your constituent information, whether that's funders, grantees, constituents that you're serving, programs that you're running, elected officials that you're in contact, partner, etc, right?
Agent: Single source of truth with permissions for each individual on who they need to see and what they need to see.
Agent: Then we're going to flow into that internal collaboration using [ORG-3], right?
Agent: A place where your global team can go a single place where they can communicate with each other to plan those strong programs, to update each other on strong programs, to collaborate, to even say like, hey, I'm going to be in [GPE-2] [DATE-5].
Agent: Are you going to be there?
Agent: Let's get all a sidebar coffee, right?
Agent: This is a collaboration tool. Then we're going to talk a little bit about engagement with marketing. So now we have a single source of truth. We have internal engagement.
Agent: How do we empower your team to use all that information?
Agent: To drive campaigns that reach the right person at the right time with the right message.
Agent: And then how do we, as we're running those campaigns, collect even deeper and more information about those individuals to then feed right our knowledge to better target them and better communicate with them in the future.
Agent: And then we're going to talk about next steps. This is a lot to cram into [TIME-1]. We have far too many slides. Some of us are going to say, we're going to skip through this really quickly.
Agent: But we want to give you as big of an overall picture of who [ORG-1] is and what we're currently thinking is a path to success for the organization. Does it sound like a good agenda. Awesome.
Agent: All right, before we go there quick thank you [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5] for the work that you're doing you are literally saving our planet.
Agent: Okay, how do we even thank you for that?
Agent: Like we owe you our lives and our future generations lives. So thank you so much for the work that you're doing. I've shared in the past, my background is in the nonprofit space.
Agent: I work for environmental organizations, including [ORG-4] here in [GPE-3] and [ORG-5], which is a global organization under different titles depending on regions.
Agent: And this work to me is so personal and so critical. And I am thrilled to be having you. these conversations with you. I'm thrilled to be able to play a small part in this work.
Agent: So than k you so much for what you're doing and thank you for coming to these conversations with an open min d and an open heart .
Agent: And really kind of looking at how we might be able to partner together to build a solid foundation for the organization. So thank you. All right, let's talk about core values. Okay, we mean these.
Agent: I can't stress this enough, right?
Agent: You probably have similar core values at your organization. Trust, customer success, innovation, the quality, and sustainability.
Agent: These are our five pillars that our company has put forth to all of us to live [DATE-6] and to own in all of our conversations with our customers.
Agent: And I'm going to talk a little bit more about that last one, sustainability on the next slide.
Agent: Here at [ORG-1], we take sustainability very seriously. Probably not as seriously as you do.
Agent: I know if I had heard that when I was on your end of the call, I would say, hey, we're living and breathing [DATE-7].
Agent: But I want you to understand that this is a core value for [ORG-1].
Agent: We within the last, gosh, these all correct me from wrong year or two, we released a new solution called Net Zero Cloud that's helping for profit companies track their emissions and drive towards Net Zero.
Agent: This is part of our initiative and part of our belief that business is an avenue for change, right?
Agent: Potentially the greatest avenue for change. And so we're working as a corporate leader in this space. We are ourselves, not zero. We run on [PERCENT-1] renewable energy.
Agent: And we have a program that falls in line with the work that you all do. A goal of planting 104 million trees by [DATE-8].
Agent: And really kind of just leading the path and helping support a mission, right, of, hey, industry, it's time to take responsibility, right, and have a role in saving our planet.
Agent: So I wanted to share this slide and I will share this after we hop off as well so that you can kind of dig into this.
Agent: But I wanted you to understand who on the phone you're talking to and what kind of our values are and what our corporate values are. This makes sense. We'd love some feedback from you on these things as well.
Agent: I'm sure we've got a collaborative team who is always looking to be better partners with the leaders in the space who are doing this important work. OK. All right.
Agent: So that's a little bit about [ORG-1] as a company, right?
Agent: Our values, who we are, what we're coming to this conversation at our core, right?
Agent: Believing. Let's talk a little bit about how our solution then helps organizations like yours become digitally mature.
Agent: That's the ultimate goal, right?
Agent: Because we hear that when organizations have digital maturity, they're 2.4994828074626 times more likely to reach their goals, and they're [PERCENT-2] of them say that their tech helped them be more efficient.
Agent: These are things that we want for you guys.
Agent: Our global, our planet needs this, right?
Agent: And so that's what we're here to talk a little bit about [DATE-1]. So oftentimes what we hear and what we've heard throughout our conversation so far is, hey, we have siloed systems.
Agent: We have some teams working in one [PRODUCT-1], another team working on in a spreadsheet here. We've got another team over here that's using a different tool to kind of help project manage their work.
Agent: And what our goal is to bring you onto a unified platform that allows you to gain insight into all of your work. at an alliance, literally in a glance, right, through advanced reporting and analytics.
Agent: We don't want these workarounds. We don't want folks saying, oh, we need to figure out how to do x, y, and [PERSON-6] So we're going to create 44 cell spreadsheet to track that.
Agent: We want to make sure that you have a foundation and a tool that will be able to house and store all of that. And that works with your team.
Agent: Is user friendly?
Agent: Is easy for them to get that information in?
Agent: And it's easy for you all to get the information out. We don't want a static solution. You all went through a merger and I believe it was [DATE-9].
Agent: [DATE-10], you guys grew tremendously. Your programs are going to continue to grow. The influence that you're having in this space is so tremendous that the work that you're doing needs to be scalable.
Agent: We need a solution that is flexible enough to adapt to the changes in the headwinds of, well, one, the actual environment and two, the environment around sustainability.
Agent: And is scalable and relies on innovation, right?
Agent: So [ORG-1], we innovate on our solutions constantly. And mentioned, [ORG-2] is happening [DATE-8] where new [ORG-6] is going to be introduced or rolled out or announced. And that's just part of what we do.
Agent: We make updates to our solutions three times a year based off of the feedback of nonprofit organizations. So we survey and we talk with our organizations throughout [DATE-14] to learn about, you know, what's still causing challenges.
Agent: Where are there opportunities for us to grow our solutions to better serve you with the work that you're doing?
Agent: I want to just pause here because I've just rambled here for maybe [TIME-2]. And I just want to get some feedback from you.
Agent: Thoughts so far on what we're talking about?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I think it sounds great. And I mean, this part is really good.
Agent: So keep it going.
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: Onward. All right. Tell me if you're like, hey, slow down for me.
Agent: All right, let's dive into specifically what are we talking about?
Agent: Okay, right?
Agent: We want to get you out of siloed systems. We want to get you out of single source of truth.
Agent: What does that mean?
Agent: Right?
Agent: What we're looking at right now, we call this our constituent or our funder or our customer, depending on who you're talking with our patient, right, in other areas of our business. 267.
Agent: In the middle is your person who you, Just think of an imaginary person who you all need to communicate with and have a strong relationship with.
Agent: This could be a board member, this could be a funder, this could be the leader of a partner organization, this could be a member of a government or an elected official.
Agent: And how do we solution, right, provide you with tools that help you maintain and grow that relationship?
Agent: Around the outside are four kind of pillars that most nonprofits, including what we've heard from you all so far, find super valuable about nonprofit class.
Agent: It's going to help you with your grants management, right?
Agent: And I want to kind of put in that bucket your project management, right?
Agent: So it's kind of, you know, helping you to be able to track the different stages of a grant, what deliverables are associated with that grant, what communication needs to happen back to the funder about that grant.
Agent: In a really clear and concise way. And because your teams are all putting data and information into [ORG-1], your single source of truth, that ability to then report back to the grantee becomes much more simplified.
Agent: [QUANTITY-2] overview of that piece of the puzzle. I also want to talk about Marketing engagement. [ORG-1] is the world number one [PRODUCT-1] and the world's number one, Marketing and engagement solution.
Agent: So we want to put good information in the [ORG-1]. We want to use that information to communicate out to our constituents. We want to use that communication to gather more information about them.
Agent: [DATE-16], excuse me, when do they open emails?
Agent: What types of emails are they open?
Agent: What are they clicking on?
Agent: When are they clicking on it?
Agent: What are they interested in?
Agent: And make sure that we are then targeting them with future communications that they're going to be responsive to, right, that bring value to them.
Agent: How do we bring value to your constituents so that their affinity is deepened with the organization?
Agent: And then how do we empower our teams internally to work collaboratively?
Agent: Hey, I noticed that this email landed. I noticed that we had a huge open rate on this. We need to really dive in and deepen engagement or our communications around this area.
Agent: Or hey, we've got a big grant coming up.
Agent: We need this renewal so badly, right?
Agent: Like the work depends on us getting this renewal.
Agent: Let's pull together and collaborate internally on [ORG-3] so that we're all pacing towards the same goal of a really strong renewal application so that we can make sure that we're continuing the funding.
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-1], can I do.
Agent: Jump in real quick?
Agent: Please
Agent: Wonderful. Hey, everybody. I am going to have to drop pretty soon to get down to [ORG-2]. Like [PERSON-1] said, I'm here in [GPE-1] [DATE-8].
Agent: You know, the nonprofit cloud is really the foundation of what we're putting forward for C4iCRAF. And what's so important about this is we're talking about these four pillars for fundraising.
Agent: We're going to talk about how you work with your funders, how you go after and seek those grants.
Agent: We're talking about how you're going to manage the actual administration of those grants, right?
Agent: Doing that required reporting, those deliverables that [PERSON-1] mentioned.
Agent: But the thing to keep in mind about [ORG-1] is we are a platform and we are designed to empower you to be able to build the things that you need around these pillars on this platform.
Agent: Because as much as we work hard with the industry, we work to deliver [PERCENT-3] of the things that you all need to do out of the box.
Agent: But we purposely maintain about a sort of difference there that allows you the agility that you need to do the things that you do because you're doing forestry research.
Agent: You're doing things that other organizations aren't doing and you're going to have procedures and things you do that don't match up with how other people do them.
Agent: And so with [ORG-1] and the nonprofit cloud we're delivering you an agile platform grounded in trust and the best practices of not just our non-profit sector, but the commercial sector, the healthcar e sector, all around the globe .
Agent: To enable you to make sure that you are going to be on a firm footing as you continue to grow and change and do new things.
Agent: And just as [PERSON-1] ended talking about the collaboration, you know, that stakeholder in the middle could very well be used.
Agent: See, it can be you that's there in the center of what C4iCraft is doing because with [ORG-3] and the ability to collaborate, we can take and put your grant reporting in [ORG-7] that then eventually flows into salesforce.
Agent: Where the reports are drawn from. So all of these pieces aren't independent silos. They're a unifie d platform . that helps us to grow and be successful.
Agent: According just for the sake of because I don't know if it's in this deck, I also want to say that we have a network of more than 3,000 applications that our partners have built on top of [ORG-1], that you can install into your [ORG-1] instance with the click of a mouse, that add much more bespoke functionality to enable you to do more while not having to create things from scratch.
Agent: And that app exchanges what we call it.
Agent: It's an integral part of how [ORG-1] works because we have partners that work in your space that understand your space, not as well as you do, but pretty close And they work with folks like [LOC-1] and all of the different [LOC-1] members .
Agent: To help learn and understand the practices around international grant making in particular and what it looks like and how it works. Just one example.
Agent: So that's I think a really important thing to understand and it helps explain sort of why we want to have a broader conversation, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5]. It's not just about the communications or the fundraising or the marketing.
Agent: It's about a broader sort of discussion around how we can help see for I. Thank you so much, [PERSON-1], for letting me jump in and do that little monologue. I'm going to go back on mute now.
Agent: All right. Awesome. Thank you, [PERSON-7].
Agent: I think you bring up some really good points, right?
Agent: And as we kind of move through [DATE-1], I want to kind of keep gut-checking with you, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], right?
Agent: So far, what we're looking at, how does this resonate with you?
Agent: What kind of questions does it bring up as we're looking at the screen right now?
EndUser: I mean, I guess when I look at this, I mean, the main thing I'm thinking about is kind of the core kind of areas of our program that we'd like to.
EndUser: That need this kind of support. And I think I think this fits it pretty well. We've discussed it already, but it's basically. the kind of fundraising grant management, project management teams. So that's two teams.
EndUser: And then both of those have a kind of a small core team and then they have a distributed teams in the regions. So that's those two teams. And I think they would really. benefit from this.
Agent: Can I ask a quick question [PERSON-4] just because this will help us as [ORG-8] e we're kind of both pulling towards hey we're gonna know if need to know how much this is going t o cost right so those two teams .
Agent: How many people are we talking about on those two teams?
EndUser: Well, they both probably, the resource mobilization team is probably like five core members. And I think the project management unit is also about the same size. And then they would have
EndUser: Distributed functions in the region, so they might each have an additional 16 people or so.
EndUser: So, you know, and I'm not sure if all of those 8 people would need to be active users, or if this could just be managed by that core team of, say, five for each.
EndUser: That part, I guess I would need to understand the solution a little bit better, and then we could.
EndUser: Could bring them in and have them explain or I could find out in detail how they would imagin e this being rolled out within their programs But that kind of takes fundraising program managemen t to some extent in grants management Between those two teams, that's kind of the main they would cover those three areas Then the Marketing and engagement is somethin g that would be better as a and should restore their curve be between my team, the communications, and Outreach tea m. probably bind with the resource mobilization or fundraising team.
EndUser: But the one that's not here, which maybe is program management, but it's that executive level
[ORG-9] Management of that executive level network and constituency. which maybe could fall into program management, but not sure.
Agent: And are you talking about executive level at your organization?
Agent: Are you talking about your relationships with other executives or leaders in the space?
EndUser: Yeah, exactly. So it's basically for use by the executives in our organization and then managing their networks.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Which would be at a similar level in our partner organizations.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: And that executive team is, you know, there's probably
EndUser: About or 23 people that we would want involved in that part.
Agent: Awesome.
Agent: That's really good for us to understand and certainly right when we're talking about the constituent, the gentleman in the middle of the circle, that can truly be anyone, right?
Agent: So those executive contacts or personal relationships that your leadership has, certainly tracking those relationships in your [PRODUCT-1] is a core use of the solution.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: Great.
Agent: And as you know, as I'm asking this question right about how many people we also talked during our last call about being able to provide you with, you know, some guide rails or some bumpers on how our licensing work.
Agent: And so anyone who would need access to that information, either to enter that information in, to view it, or to report out on it, would require a user license.
Agent: And so having information about headcounts and things of that nature helps us to start kind of plugging those numbers in, rather than using [PRODUCT-2], right?
Agent: It's kind of finessing that fine tuning that, and we'll continue to massage that throughout our conversations to make sure we're landing on an appropriate number of users. for the organization.
Agent: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah. I mean, so is this something though that I should go out and find out from our out to them pretty much right away.
Agent: Team?
Agent: I can definitely get
EndUser: And is there any distinction between like a kind of management type user?
EndUser: So if we have five people in the core team for fundraising. you know, and if they have maybe 13 people who would access that in addition to those five, we would just count that as 13 people.
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Yeah, we, the user licenses, depending on you know, their role at the organization, stay the same. the access or the information that they can view or change or etc can change.
EndUser: Okay. Okay. Okay. That's that's how cool. So I can, I can find that out.
Agent: Okay, fantastic. And as we get towards the end of the call [DATE-1], I'm going to propose some next steps where we talk maybe with some core members of each of those teams over [DATE-8].
Agent: So that we can do a deep dive into their specific day-to-day operations and needs, right, and have a better understanding from them. So we can, you know, you can certainly reach out to start getting those guide rail numbers.
Agent: And then we will also, you know, if you're comfortable with giving us access to folks to kind of better understand their day-to-day operations, we'll ask those questions as well during our calls.
EndUser: Okay, yep, that's fine.
Agent: Great.
Agent: I'm going to move forward because I've got a couple of people on this call that are like, are you going to let me talk here [DATE-1]?
Agent: And so I'm going to bounce quickly. So we talked a little bit about nonprofit cloud. I will send this deck as follow up so that you can drill into this.
Agent: But this little picture here is just a great visual of what some dashboards and what the internal nonprofit cloud might look like for you all. All right, ramp making.
Agent: We've talked about this really high level two slides back, but this is a solution that's going to allow you to create your unified view of all your funding programs.
Agent: From everything from planning through delivery through renewal and reapplying for those grants. It's going to quicker teams right to have visualization on the outcomes of those grants to make adjustments throughout. Right throughout the program.
Agent: Hey, this doesn't seem to be working. We need to, we need to tweak this right better stronger programs lead to more funding leads to better stronger programs.
Agent: And it's going to help you gain some efficiencies right bringing your teams together under one single source of truth to really dive in. So we're just talking previously about numbers around grant making teams, leadership teams, project management teams.
Agent: I'm curious if there are other folks at the organization who would need access for data entry.
Agent: These might be folks who are regionally based, folks who are doing actual, doing the actual resource and reporting back to the team about the status of projects.
Agent: Just curious if that opens up any kind of, you know, you can get good informatio n at this email .
Agent: Just oNY fiv e people in col d Anything else for you that we should kind of dig into for [TIME-3].
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I guess the question here would be for us, whether we would want a kind of small, centrally managed, kind of tightly controlled system, which would then mean a small team that's really dedicated to managing this resource.
EndUser: Or if we want to devolve that to the people who are actually responsible for it. implementing the projects. So that's a larger group of maybe 21 people or something lik e that .
EndUser: And whether that would be worthwhile to extend that to them. I'm sure they would benefit from it, but then there's the cost part of it as well, which we're not really sure about yet.
EndUser: But that would be, I guess, a second level to be considered.
Agent: Absolutely. Yeah. What we'll be able to do as we're getting some rough volumes, we know that you're going to need to tweak these numbers.
Agent: From you is we can start massaging those numbers, right?
Agent: And so as you're kind of thinking about weighing the two things, right?
Agent: One is, what do we need?
Agent: What can we afford?
Agent: We do this all day, every day in our personal lives as well.
Agent: Right?
Agent: And trying to find the balance between those two things.
Agent: And so as we kind of dive into, you know, costs and things of that nature, we can massage those, we can make adjustments and really kind of get that into a place that it's going to make sense for the organization.
Agent: All right. [PERSON-8], I've been talking now for too long. You're
Agent: Off. Okay. Thank you, [PERSON-1]. And just to take a quick step back on the [ORG-3] piece, [PERSON-4], I know that you've had some experience using [ORG-3].
Agent: And I just wanted to, yeah, take a step back and remind everyone kind of how we think about [ORG-3] and what it has become over [DATE-16] now.
Agent: So we know that there are other channel-based Messaging platforms out there in the space, but [ORG-3] is really the only platform that brings together automation, knowledge, and connection together in one place so that we can help drive productivity.
Agent: In a whole new way, really with the goal of helping organizations go faster towards their mission. So it starts with this open and extensible platform.
Agent: And again, you'll hear me using the word platform a lot because again [ORG-3] is so much more than just a direct Messaging tool. It truly is a platform.
Agent: So Similar to what [PERSON-9] was mentioning about [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-1], we keep this open and extensible so that you can customize [ORG-3] to meet the needs of C4. What your [ORG-3] looks like may be different from other nonprofit organizations.
Agent: We purposely keep it that way.
Agent: On top of that, we also have over 2,539 applications that can be integrated into [ORG-3] and are ready to go with the click of a button so that you can use all the apps that you already have [DATE-1] at [ORG-10] them together in one place That includes, I know we've talked about and heard that some of those applications that exist [DATE-1] are things like Zoom We can think of things like [PERSON-10], which I know has been mentioned on a few calls, time sheets, those can all be integrated into you r Slack instance.
Agent: And of course, [ORG-3] has deep connections with the [ORG-1] customer 47 so that everything that [PERSON-1] was mentioning previously, there are deep integrations in to that and not something that we can explore as well.
Agent: How do those platforms work togethe r?
Agent: So, how does [ORG-3] make work more productive?
Agent: We do it in three k ey you is. One is accelerating work with automation. So this automation can be things like no code workflows, pre-built integrations.
Agent: And really you can think of this as those day-to-day tasks, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-8], that we all have to do, that may not feel like they're driving towards the mission completely, but they have to get done.
Agent: There are opportunities where [ORG-3] can help automate some of these so that you can spend your time on the work you really need to be doing.
Agent: The second way we help organizations be more productive is by searching and sharing knowledge. And we heard through our conversations to date that.
Agent: This is going to be something that's very important for C4 when we're talking about research sharing, right?
Agent: Or we're talking about being able to search through a system that has all of this knowledge in it. You can think of [ORG-3] as almost a repository for knowledge.
Agent: So the more information that you put in there, actually the more valuable it becomes. Because that is all accessible and searchable by the staff. at the organization .
Agent: The third way that we help organizations become more productive is really by connecting and engaging everyone.
Agent: Again, we heard that this is something that's very important to see for when we think about how your workforce is globally distributed, working across different time zones, sometimes in different languages.
Agent: So this is where we think about that idea, [PERSON-4], that you mentioned in the past of creating that kind of common culture. and connecting everyone.
Agent: And there's a number of built-in features within [ORG-3], such as huddles and clips that help bring that workforce together. So [PERSON-1], if you don't mind just moving to the next slide.
Agent: And as you're doing that again, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], when we're thinking about [ORG-3], how I like to think about it in the context of the Salesforce 383 that [PERSON-1] was mentioning, think of [ORG-3] as that engagement layer.
Agent: So when [PERSON-1] was mentioning that grants management process, you can think of [ORG-3] and that example is the place where that collaboration operation around that process would be taking place .
Agent: The work that goes into that proces s would take place in [ORG-3] .
Agent: That make sense ?
Agent: So as far as what we've heard to date from you all, you know, we really value the opportunity to help see for transform your internal collaboration.
Agent: We know that's what you had come to us to talk about originally and really based on what we've heard to date, we're thinking about this in three buckets of how we can do this for you.
Agent: And would love any feedback on this, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], to make sure we're going down the right path.
Agent: So one of those, again, this goes back to that, creating that common culture, [PERSON-4], that I know you've mentioned by breaking down silos. So we really think about driving staff collaboration and productivity.
Agent: And that means getting work done from anywhere, uniting everyone in this common culture at C4 with the tools that you're already using [DATE-1] and bringing that fall.
Agent: Together again and what we can think of as like a digital office . We also have the opportunity to support the research that you mentioned was so critical to C4.
Agent: So we have many, many customers that are using [ORG-3] to move research forward by ensuring timely consistent secure communication.
Agent: Bringing everyone together who's working on that research in one place, cross-functionally, so that they're engaged in all of the stages of the research project.
Agent: They're able to share that across the organization and support that key piece of your organization. And then thirdly, accelerating organizational success and project management.
Agent: So again, by centralizing and automating information from multiple sources into [ORG-3], into one single source of truth and one platform, that can support faster collaboration, decision making.
Agent: We project management is one of the key use cases that we see [ORG-3] being used for across.
Agent: All different types of Industries So we feel very confident that that's somethin g that we can also help provide value around And therefore, of course, ultimately helping you you know, drive towards your missio n in a more productive way .
Agent: So I'll pause there for a second. Would love to hear any feedback. As you could probably see on the last slide, there's a lot that [ORG-3] can do.
Agent: So we want to make sure that we're aligning to your key priorities and we can certainly pivot if these aren't those.
EndUser: Yeah, no, this sounds great. And this is, like you said, this is the original reason why we started the conversation. And I think you pretty much had the main points.
EndUser: The one that I just wanted to make sure we don't forget is that there's need for collaborative spaces, which could be a collaborative space around a project or a research theme.
EndUser: Or say a new strategy developmen t like this saying we're doing in [LOC-2] but then there's also would be some nee d for kind of management communication to staff So it would be great to hear more about that how exactly that would work
EndUser: How that space can be controlled and manage d so that conversation don't just kind of, you know, get out of contro [NORP-1] So that would be, that's the part of it that we would definitely want t o, that would want to see that in the, you know, kind of articulated in the [GPE-4] l.
Agent: Great. Thank you for sharing that, [PERSON-4]. And that's great to hear. And absolutely something that [ORG-3] is wonderful at as well. So we will make sure in our next steps that is something that we show and is articulated.
Agent: It's something that we do every day here at [ORG-1]. So we have a lot of wonderful examples of how management communicates to staff, how staff communicates to one another, some best practices around that, some examples of that.
Agent: Certainly a key part of what [ORG-3] can help do And then as far as that need for collaborative spaces .
Agent: Around, you know, a strategic meeting that you all are having, like the one you're at [DATE-1] or things of that nature. absolutely [PERCENT-1] as well.
Agent: And actually we have a solution that I think will make a lot of sense when we show it to you as far as how we can almost have different workspaces that bucket, whether it's certain projects, certain departments, perhaps even certain, you know, management groups.
Agent: So we can go into that more for sure. And that kind of goes along the lines of.
Agent: I know you had mentioned previously that you've been working in a single workspace and it's like how do we organize something for all 667 staff members and keep that clean and keep that organized.
Agent: We have a solution for that. So I think that ties into what you're mentioning as well. So we'll certainly share that too. So thank you for that feedback. Anything else on that piece. Stay here. [PERSON-4].
Agent: No, that's good. That's great. OK, great. [PERSON-1], we can just slip to this, but I want to make sure that [PERSON-14] has some time here.
Agent: So really, again, just to wrap up, we can change the way that organizations work and function. And we are really excited about the opportunity to do that with you all and partner with you on that.
Agent: So thank you again for the opportunity.
Agent: I will hand it over to [PERSON-14], I believe, right?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: And I just want to kind of just weigh in really quickly here because I think that this is a really interesting transition in our in the presentation that we're doing right now, right?
Agent: We're talking about [ORG-3] internal collaboration tool, internal communication to help alleviate in part, right, [PERSON-4], to your point, help alleviate in part, crowded email inboxes. Right, how do we get all the communication that we need accomplished without.
Agent: Having an all staff email that goes out to hundreds of people that they don't need to see. And I think that this is a really interesting segue because [ORG-3] can help with that internal communication.
Agent: And what we're gonna talk about next and what [PERSON-14]'s gonna dive into is Marketing cloud, right?
Agent: Those external communications that you're gonna be sending out into the world.
Agent: Well, how do we ensure that those communications are meaningful and not, crowding out people in boxes, right?
Agent: And [PERSON-14]'s gonna dive into that a little bit about using all of that rich information that you have on your constituents to send targeted messages that are valuable to them, right?
Agent: So that they drive their engagement of the organization and not just clutter in boxes. [PERSON-14], do you
Agent: Wanna take it from there?
Agent: Yeah, sounds good, thank you. Yeah, so I know we have some things to do to close up the call too. So we'll keep it relatively high level.
Agent: But of course on the left-hand side here of this slide is what we typically see, right?
Agent: A very, very common challenges that organizations that we work with run into in terms of communications and making sure they're relevant and effective.
Agent: And really, and saving your team time too, right?
Agent: Especially with distributed teams as many locations as you have. I think it was up to 26 locations.
Agent: All of the various stakeholders you communicate with, right?
Agent: Government officials, funders, administrators, partners, universities, field assistants, right?
Agent: Who may be less responsive to email?
Agent: And then those senior level communications with important relationships with funders and officials that influence policy. So we wanna make sure that we're being effective and efficient.
Agent: Right in our communications approach and in the governance and how we Structure the technology here given distributed teams as well And that's what Marketing Cloud does right as a native salesforce solution It's about being able to use all of that information natively in your salesforce [PRODUCT-1], but also from any source so you can automate personalized journeys as we call them or campaigns that are relevant and timely that inspire your supporters to take action, right?
Agent: And all sort of a seamless process make increasing your efficiency, increasing your effectiveness through better email deliverability than it improves conversion rates, drives people to register for those events.
Agent: Then during the events are we sending appropriate communications and post-event, right?
Agent: Are we intelligently segmenting our database and particularly with each location so that those stakeholders regionally only receive those messages that are relevant to them?
Agent: And then of course, increasing your impact through.
Agent: The ability to optimize moving forward based on the performance of each of those campaigns, right?
Agent: So you're able to measure those metrics to know what's working and what's not working. And if you just advance to the next slide, this is really illustrating how the Marketing cloud, [ORG-1]'s communication and engagement solution.
Agent: Helps you know and expand your community through personalized experiences.
Agent: But given the time, I just want to touch on and highlight some of those important pieces for your organization, right?
Agent: Allowing each location to manage their own set of contacts locally.
Agent: While also providing that governance for one or two centralized locations is sort of more moved toward more of a centralized model, those two headquarters acting as one, providing all of the branding and templates for the organization.
Agent: So that the branding, you kind of protect that, right?
Agent: It's coming from one location, but also, providing each different location and team the flexibility to personalize for each of those locations.
Agent: While ensuring that you're compliant with [ORG-8], which is a major concern, right, that [PRODUCT-3] has certain features and functionality, and it's built in to support.
Agent: Right to be forgotten data portability, consent, restriction of processing, right?
Agent: Security, accountability and transparency, all of those things around GDPR. So that's top of mind for us for your organization as well.
Agent: And at the same time, as I just wrapped this up, supporting various languages for each location and all of the different domains that you have as assets for your organization.
Agent: And there are various ways to go about that, including what we call international sense, which allows you to select the specific language encoding for your email and provides pre-translated supporting pages, right?
Agent: So we can kind of hone in on what's going to be the best approach for you all. But that's what we've heard. Those are some of the additional questions we have around those. And then...
Agent: I'm just going to pause here looking at the time and because I've been chatting away.
Agent: Any questions about what we've covered so far?
Agent: Does that resonate based on everything we've heard from you [DATE-1]?
Agent: Do we miss the mark on anything so far?
Agent: Any questions or initial reactions?
EndUser: No, this sounds good. I think what we're... We're this, I guess overlaps kind of two areas of the organization. So, you know, Part of this is
EndUser: Well, if we look at marketing, I think we kind of need to look at two things. So there's the part of the organization, which is about fundraising.
Agent: Because,
EndUser: You know, I think we've covered that in quite some detail. And, you know, I think that some of the aspects of this in terms of, you know, if we're looking at segmentation and, you know, conversion and.
EndUser: You know, KPIs, all of that relates really quite, you know, to quite well to the resource mobilization team. From the communications team, there's, you know, we do a lot of these things as well.
EndUser: And, you know, we do have a pretty strong Marketing program. The goals are a little bit different. So those are not really. inversion goals in terms of marketing, or in terms of fundraising.
EndUser: But the goals there are more about
EndUser: Kind of thought leadership, you know, driving, you know, driving the conversation around global change and, you know, and what we're, you know, what are the kind of recommendations of what we're doing.
EndUser: So you know, those kinds of things are, you know, we look more at, you know, are people using our research?
EndUser: Are we being cited?
EndUser: You know, are we being cited?
EndUser: Are we appearing in traditional media, in our engagement on social media, and then al l the kind of things, the open rate of the newsletter, click-through rate, all of that kind of stuff all of which is pretty reasonably well advanced .
EndUser: But it's interesting to see how this could also, you know, these tools could be utilized in that way, possibly.
Agent: Yes, absolutely.
Agent: Having all of that connected, even though they're for different, you're measuring different things, right?
Agent: But still connected to communications overall for your organization. Now, I believe that [ORG-14], which is an important piece of it too, is using [ORG-16].
Agent: Are there different solutions that are being used for or by the resource mobilization and then your team Marketing communications?
EndUser: Yeah, so right now, we're really not that connected. So, yeah, for [ORG-14], we So we managed that the [ORG-14] accounts, so we're using [ORG-16] for that, and we use that for our C4Recraft accounts as well.
EndUser: So yeah, but there's not a big connect. It's a very different model. Resource mobilization is really relationships with governments and so forth.
Agent: And donor agencies
EndUser: Whereas for Outreach and engagement, we're looking at partners and practitioners that are in our field, big education and so forth.
Agent: Constituency
Agent: Gotcha.
Agent: And then real quick out of curiosity, thinking about tools and kind of what they used, it's kind of what you were describing kind of sounded like social listening or listening across kind of the social ecosphere, not just social media, including social media, but also on the web for, you know, maybe what these stakeholders may be using as far as your resources and publications and things.
Agent: Is that something you're doing now?
Agent: And if so, what are you using to listen?
EndUser: Yeah, well, we don't have like a great social listening solution.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: For social media, we use [PERSON-16] social. And so that, which is pretty sophisticated, but at the top end of their solution, it's a bit out of our range in terms So we can't quite go to of cost.
Agent: That talk. Sure. And, you know, we, [PRODUCT-4] integrates really nicely with [ORG-8], whether you're leveraging the listening component or not, just thinking about, you know, posting the resources and whatever you're using there.
Agent: So we partner with them really closely. All right. You know, the next slide really [PERSON-4] just kind of highlights some of those metrics.
Agent: We like to keep a really finger on the pulse of how our customers are doing, right?
Agent: Specifically, our nonprofit customers.
Agent: So those that do switch to a native marketing, a [ORG-1] Marketing solution, see an increase in all the right areas and a decrease in all the right areas, right?
Agent: In terms of return on investment and retention and acquisition of supporters and all those good things. So we certainly wanted to include that in the deck. But... This has been extremely valuable.
Agent: Thank you again and at this time I'm going to pass it back to recording.
Agent: Awesome and we are right at our time. I'm hoping that folks we every single time we have to run a little bit over. I'm hoping folks have a little bit of flexibility here as we close out our call.
Agent: I wanted to talk a little bit [PERSON-4] about you know kind of circling back to high-level process, right?
Agent: So what we show [DATE-1], we call this a digital transformation, right?
Agent: These are not small projects. They are not inexpensive projects. This could range anywhere from, you know, to do everything we talked about upwards to a [MONEY-1], right, depending on the volumes and counts.
Agent: And so I want to just benchmark with you. I know we were just talking about [PERSON-8] Social and it's a good saguai, right, as far as feasibility, right, and budget for the organization. Do those numbers.
Agent: Right and you are should we dial back should we continue to move forward with what we're kind of discussing here what are your initial reaction and thoughts to that?
Agent: Hope you're on mute.
EndUser: This is
Agent: That's [DATE-3] yeah it would be [DATE-3] for licensing yes yeah
EndUser: What would be like the split between the solutions?
Agent: Because we are not. quite there yet.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Right. We're doing mental math on our end and we have been for [DATE-13] as we've had these conversations.
Agent: And that's a big range, right?
Agent: That I just gave you 260 to a million is a significant range.
Agent: And so kind of what I have on the screen right now as far as next up is doing deep dives into each one of these core solutions that we just kind of outlined. And.
Agent: To be fully transparent, we are the closest to being able to provide you with pricing on [ORG-3] and marketing.
Agent: Okay, so I'd like to lead with those two deep dives and then we're going to be able to give you, you know, those buckets, right, and the pricing associated with those buckets.
Agent: And through those conversations, we're going to learn more about your [PRODUCT-1] needs. And really it comes down to those volumes, right, and those counts. So we [DATE-1] are tally, right, my mental tally.
Agent: I think it was around 108, we heard.
Agent: We still have a question mark of is that the final number?
Agent: Are there going to be other folks at the organization?
Agent: And we're thinking there probably are through our discovery that would need licenses. And so that's really where we're kind of going to need to do a little bit more discovery and understand use cases.
Agent: But I wanted to give out a range just because I think we're a little bit of chicken and egg here, right?
Agent: If we're not talking about something that's feasible for the organization, then we need to kind of pivot and change and focus and hone in on, you know, what is feasible?
Agent: Where can we have the biggest impact in ROI?
Agent: And so that's kind of my thought process here [DATE-1].
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I guess from, you know, I guess the, It depends a bit on how, I guess, how it's split up amongst those, you know, kind of four buckets, whether we would, you know, there would be decisions about the return on investment for each of the buckets, I think for [ORG-3], it's, you know, it's pretty, it seems a bit more straightforward to me.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So,
EndUser: You know, we have 693 staff. you know, we would want everyone to have access to that.
EndUser: You know, we would, I think, you know, the kind of functionality that you outlined is, you know, what we would want for all of those people. So that one seems to be pretty straightforward.
EndUser: Crm to me is something that we could probably scale to meet the budget, right?
EndUser: So we could have a, a small, tightly managed CRM system. And if that's enough to get started with, to implement and people start to use it and they see how it works.
EndUser: And then we say, okay, now let's roll it out [DATE-13] and include more people when we feel like we've got, you know, some good results and we have people on the team who are, you know, can kind of lead that with their broader global teams.
EndUser: You know, that might be a nice way to handle the [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: And, you know, it would also allow I think it would give the internal team confidence that, okay, this is working for us and we definitely want to roll it out further.
EndUser: We're seeing a definite return on investment, so it's going to pay itself off and that's great.
EndUser: Then the Marketing part, I'm a little bit less sure about partially because it's For the communications side of things, it's working reasonably well. I have no doubt that these tools would improve.
EndUser: But that and because it's kind of split between resource mobilization and communications in our organization the way we are now. That one I would have to think about more
EndUser: Or maybe hear more about or talk internally about how we might collaborate across our two functional areas to make them optimize that.
EndUser: But I guess the thing with the communications is it's, I think it's seen as working reasonably well.
EndUser: So it'd be a bigger ask to say, you know, we're taking something that's working well and, you know, spending more on it.
EndUser: So that would be a bigger ask where I think from the resource mobilization side, I think people would feel like, oh, wow, but we do need a solution here. We don't have the solution.
EndUser: Now we need something better . So that's a easier ask.
Agent: That makes perfect sense, right?
Agent: And I think that as we're thinking through this, having that phased mindset is going to lead to success here, right?
Agent: Into a good partnership. I do want us to spend some time digging into each of these buckets with the appropriate teams so we can at least give you sideposts right.
Agent: The reality is that ROI goes through the roof skyrockets with an interconnected full solution set, right?
Agent: And so as we're talking about this, we will in our future conversations start weaving in some of those ROI metrics.
Agent: I'm hearing right now that your Marketing solution is working for you and that you guys are happy with how it's performing.
Agent: It's on us to kind of explain why change, right?
Agent: Like what would be the value add to the organization. And the good news is we have because of the nature of our business, we have lots of data on metrics to help guide that as well.
Agent: And so I'm actually going to propose just giving internally are calendars and this is going to seem a little backwards given what you just said [PERSON-4], that we actually start with maybe a deeper dive into your Marketing and book out [TIME-1] here in [DATE-21] to better understand things like the volumes of messages that you're sending.
Agent: [PERSON-14] is like [PERSON-1], there's so many questions I have. And I think that I think that you and [PERSON-5] are the right people to have for that portion.
Agent: But I'd love to also invite anybody that's on the fundraising side of your Marketing and communication and Outreach to join that call.
Agent: Is that something that you'd be open to?
EndUser: Yeah, so I mean, we do I would like to bring in, you know, representatives from the fundraising team as well as our Outreach person. And she would be good to have on that call as well.
Agent: Okay, fantastic. Is now a good time for us to compare calendars. That's exactly who we want there to.
EndUser: We would have to reach out to them. the Outreach person just left for [GPE-5], so that's good, go in your direction.
EndUser: And she'll be in [GPE-5] and then [GPE-6] for [DATE-17], week and a half. So that's okay. Then from the fundraising side, we have someone based in [GPE-7].
EndUser: I'd like to have him involved and then someone else in [GPE-8]. So it's going to maybe get a little tricky to get everyone involved in that.
EndUser: Can you give us some options?
Agent: Yeah, [PERSON-14], do you have some options
Agent: You can pull out?
Agent: Yeah, just pulling up time zones for those other places you mentioned as well, [PERSON-4], because I want to be cognizant of that. So yeah, [GPE-7], of course, is going to be much later, so the earlier, the better.
Agent: So if we could do like a or [TIME-4], also for that person who's going to be in [GPE-5] and [GPE-6]. And then [PERSON-16], let me know if this works with your calendar.
Agent: We could potentially do [DATE-23] at 9 or 9
Agent: And 838 [ORG-16] is the time
Agent: That this meeting started. Just kind of. Yeah, that would be that would be 261 in [GPE-2].
EndUser: Ok, yeah, [DATE-23] is not going to work for me.
Agent: It looks like we could also do [DATE-21] or [DATE-26]. At those times, I mean, really, any time [DATE-5] at those times, if that works for sharing.
Agent: I can't do [DATE-21] at [DATE-17]. have Oh, thank you.
Agent: I something on my calendar.
Agent: My calendar is pretty up to date, but I couldn't do [DATE-21], but I could potentially do any other day.
Agent: Um, or potentially [TIME-5], which would be three. [GPE-2].
Agent: Yeah, I could do [DATE-26]. I could do at that time. I could do [DATE-26]. Um, really any other day that week. At that time would work except for [DATE-21].
EndUser: Yeah, so I could do [DATE-26], but a little bit later, [DATE-26] at four [GPE-2]. No, sorry. Yeah, four in [GPE-2].
Agent: So that would be, I guess, 10 for you. Yeah, that'd be 10 of [ORG-16]. That works for me. It looks like it works for you, [PERSON-13], for [TIME-1].
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: That works. Okay. And then I could do [DATE-26] at [DATE-17].
EndUser: Um, and. It looks like [DATE-17] at 10
Agent: Again.
Agent: It looks like
Agent: We could do it. I want to make sure that [PERSON-13] well.
Agent: Is on these calls as
Agent: [PERSON-13] needs to be our constant. So it looks like we could do [DATE-17] at 854.
EndUser: Can you design work for for you.
Agent: You?
Agent: Share this out
EndUser: Yes. Be 10.
Agent: Yeah, I think that Yeah, that works for me too.
EndUser: Works actually better for
Agent: Everybody.
Agent: [PERSON-13], I see that I can
Speaker 9: You've got.
Agent: Make that work. Yes, I can do [DATE-17]. I was going to be me to the punch. I can't do [DATE-26] [TIME-6] at all. I have two
Agent: Other customer calls.
Agent: So
EndUser: [DATE-26]. [DATE-17], we're going to [DATE-17].
EndUser: Can we just because I am not sure people?
Agent: About the other Just to give them some options.
EndUser: Oh, yes.
Agent: I mean
EndUser: Is [DATE-26] at [DATE-17].
EndUser: Is it possible?
Agent: Let me put this whole. Let's this on our calendar.
Agent: Hold
Agent: I'll look at it. The calendar is here.
Agent: One star and I and I believe [PERSON-16]. I'm not sure about I can do [DATE-26].
Agent: [PERSON-13].
Agent: Okay, great.
Speaker 9: Okay.
Agent: And
Speaker 9: [PERSON-8].
Speaker 9: Are these?
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And then [PERSON-4], the other thing for [DATE-26] already, I can see if I can move it. So I can tentatively join for [DATE-26].
EndUser: Okay, and then so [PERSON-5], maybe you could check with [PERSON-21] and [PERSON-17], either available on those two times.
EndUser: And be good.
Agent: And then the other thing that I wanted to. Um, sorry, so kind of propose here, [PERSON-4]. And I'm putting these on our calendar so that we don't lose track of them done. yeah. No, done.
Agent: Is, you know, we talked about this when we did our map review. The other kind of component here is we're, this team is focused and zoomed down on the licensing that you need through [ORG-1].
Agent: The other piece, the puzzle is bringing that licensing to life as [PERSON-9] outlined, right?
Agent: Of it out of the box you're going to be able to run with.
Agent: It's really that [PERCENT-4] component of fine tuning, the nothing building, Specifically for your organization, using your language, your processes, your needs, is going to be done through an Implementation team, a third party team.
Agent: I want to make sure that we're clear on this because this is an additional line item in budget, right?
Agent: In [DATE-26], or if we do a phased approach, you know, it might be, you know, like, I want to just make that really clear. Not [DATE-21] forever, but [DATE-21] as you're going through your bases.
Agent: I'd like to bring in an implementation, make a recommendation on somebody, and hopefully be able to coordinate our calendars to bring them in on our next call.
Agent: Is that something that you're comfortable with at this point?
Agent: Because the goal would be, hey, we're able to provide you numbers on licensing, as well as then numbers for implementation. So you have total cost of ownership going into your budgeting season.
EndUser: Does that make sense?
EndUser: Yeah, no, I think that's good.
Agent: Yeah, bring them in. Bring them in. Okay. And when we're thinking about partners, we're kind of benchmarking this on a couple of different things.
Agent: Partners that have done similar work in the past, partners that align with your vision and values as an organization, partners that meet a reasonable budget threshold, and reasonable is very much, actually, what's the right word, right?
Agent: It's very flexible, right, depending on how we look at it.
Agent: But then the other core component is... where are they located, right?
Agent: As we're looking at calendars right now and trying to figure out, you know, how do best work with you through this evaluation, most of us being on in [LOC-3] of [GPE-3], is there value in us looking at maybe either a partner that's located in close to [GPE-8] or in [LOC-2], just as, you know, a way of balancing, right?
Agent: Or is that less important to you all?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean for us the kind of [GPE-9] is the kind of sweet zone from a time point of view. So, you know, from, if Yeah.
Agent: You look at that.
EndUser: Kind of swath. Then that's ideal because we can usually coordinate from [LOC-4] to the [LOC-5] something, even if it's not always that easy to get all three regions on a call. But someone who's based in that time zone
Agent: Can go either way. I was thinking that might be the case. Yeah.
Agent: So let us noodle on and it actually is a little bit of our, frankly, our delay, right?
Agent: Because we're reaching out to. yo u some colleagues to get recommendations on partners in those time zones.
Agent: We want to make sure having a good partner is such a critical piece, right?
Agent: These are folks that you're going to be on the phone with. really consistently for a significant portion of time, it helps bring your life to your solution to life, as I mentioned.
Agent: And it also is going to be very critical when we're talking about delivering training and adoption, right?
Agent: We don't want to see you invest [QUANTITY-1] of money into a solution that nobody uses, right?
Agent: Like, let's prevent that from happening by making sure you're working with a really good partner who can help. inspire your teams, right, through usability, ease of use, and then also training and adoption techniques.
Agent: And so we're going to want to make sure that we have a really strong partner engaged in the rest of our process. They're also going to be listening for different things than we're listening for and asking different questions.
Agent: We're very much focused on making sure you're getting the tools, right?
Agent: And then they're very much focused on bringing those tools to life and in pulling, you know, existing data from different solutions.
Agent: We know you guys are an earpiece, right?
Agent: Like they're going to architect the licensing. So we'll bring them in ASAP. I want to, again, I'm taught I'm I've been on a listening tour, frankly, internally with my colleagues, both in [GPE-3] and then throughout [LOC-2].
Agent: On who might be a good partner to bring in that kind of would help support this work. I'm zooming in on that.
Agent: I want to do frankly an interviewer too with the partners to make sure that we're bringing somebody to the table that's really going to work.
Agent: Just kind of giving you a little preview of what's happening behind the scenes here. Just when you're not hearing from us, we're thinking about you guys. All right, cool.
Agent: And then, Do we want to quickly look at calendars [DATE-26]?
Agent: [PERSON-8], or when [PERSON-23] is back online to try to do that deep dive for [ORG-3]?
Agent: Yes, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], if you have [TIME-7], we'd love to just book that deep dive for [ORG-3].
Agent: And really the intention there is I think we want to show you a little bit more of what the product actually looks like and how it can map to some of those solutions that we talked about.
Agent: So if you're open to that, and I don't know again similarly to the Marketing piece, if there's other folks you want to bring in, or [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], if it's you guys, that's wonderful as well.
Agent: So, you know, you let us know, but really the goal of that call would be, we've heard a lot of the use cases for [ORG-3].
Agent: Let's show you a little bit more about what the product can do and what it can look like, and make sure that we're aligned to those.
Agent: And then coming out of that, I think we can have a very good idea of what licensing and cost can look like frankly. [DATE-38] or that following week that first week in [DATE-36].
Agent: That would probably be a good time for us. Right now, [DATE-38], I can see that that morning works pretty well for our team.
Agent: I don't know if that's open for you all or if it's best to look to [DATE-21], we could do something [DATE-26] [DATE-26], [EVENT-1].
EndUser: 4th. I think that's okay. Okay.
Agent: Does this time work?
Agent: Does a little later in the day work, like even [TIME-8] start?
EndUser: So started for in [GPE-2].
Agent: [PERSON-21]?
Agent: Yeah, for one or two.
EndUser: So, okay, I think for that one, it would be good to have some people from HR and maybe a couple of the people that I would bring in for that. But that's okay.
EndUser: We can do for, yeah, [TIME-9], it's okay. CET, it's okay. On [DATE-26].
Agent: So that would be [TIME-10].
Agent: Eastern I think and [TIME-8] in [GPE-2].
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Does that work?
EndUser: Is that right?
Agent: Three or four?
Agent: Yeah, it's okay?
EndUser: Four. I'm just [ORG-13]. Okay. Is that That's [TIME-14].
Agent: Okay. Great. It's [DATE-30].
EndUser: I don't
Agent: Know if that works with.
Agent: Your schedules,
Agent: But. That looks good for [PERSON-13] and I.
Agent: Okay. [PERSON-4], do we want you want us to give another option for [DATE-21] in case some of those other folks can't make it [DATE-26] on your end or.
Agent: We can.
EndUser: We can see. I guess.
EndUser: We can do [DATE-21] at the fourth.
Agent: Same time. The Yeah. OK. That can be our backup. But we can plan on that [DATE-38].
Agent: And then [PERSON-4], it's [PERSON-5], if you hear from other folks that on your end that the fourth is better, I'm sorry, but yeah, the fourth.
EndUser: We can make that work.
Agent: All right.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: We did it.
Agent: Scheduling is
EndUser: Always the hardest part.
Agent: We're [TIME-16] over our allotted time. I kind of feel like we probably should be scheduling these meetings for longer, but we will never learn.
EndUser: And
Agent: But I'm super excited that we had this opportunity to have this chat. I Recorded this. I also have this deck. I'm going to send this follow-up to you all so that you can check it out.
Agent: Thank you so much, [PERSON-26]. And then any kind of questions leading into [DATE-5], please let us know. I can't stress enough that as we're having this next series of calls, the more the merrier.
Agent: We want voices from every level of the organization to be engaged. Right, somebody who is... You know, entering in data, you know, we received a wire transfer check in, and, you know, needs to put that in.
Agent: It's as valuable in these conversations as somebody who is looking at overall reporting and doing forecasting on, you know, when the anticipated funds are coming in, right?
Agent: We want to make sure that we have the full picture here because this is a solution that's going to support the full team, right?
Agent: The full, the full organization. And so, Please don't be shy about inviting people and bringing their voice to the calls. Also, please don't be shy about sending out that survey.
Agent: That's still going to be super valuable for us to have that information.
EndUser: Yeah, we'll keep pushing that one. And we'll also work with our teams to give them a little bit better briefing on where we are and what we need going forward.
EndUser: Awesome.
Agent: Thank you guys so much. We'll send you out onward.
EndUser: Thank you so much. And I session.
Agent: Have a great, great strategy
Agent: Thank Thank you.
EndUser: You, [PERSON-4]. Thank you, [PERSON-5].
Agent: Bye bye.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job articulating the value proposition of the seller's product and company. They explained how the product can help the customer collaborate internally, build strong programs, deliver those programs, measure impact, and report back to funders. They also emphasized the seller's commitment to sustainability and how their solutions can help the customer become digitally mature. However, there were a few instances where the sales rep could have done a better job:

1. During the introduction of the seller's company, the sales rep mentioned that they have a conference called [ORG-2] and that they will be making [QUANTITY-1] announcements about exciting new innovations on their solutions. While this is informative, it does not directly relate to the value proposition of the seller's product or company.
2. The sales rep mentioned that the seller's [PRODUCT-1] is a single source of truth for storing all of the customer's constituent information. While this is an important feature, the sales rep could have emphasized how this feature can help the customer achieve their goals, such as improving collaboration, reducing errors, or saving time.
3. The sales rep mentioned that the seller's [ORG-3] is a collaboration tool, but they could have provided more specific examples of how this tool can help the customer. For instance, they could have mentioned that [ORG-3] can help the customer's global team communicate with each other, plan programs, update each other on program status, and collaborate on projects.
4. The sales rep mentioned that the seller's solutions can help the customer become digitally mature, but they could have provided more details on what this means and how it can benefit the customer. For example, they could have mentioned that digital maturity can lead to increased efficiency, better decision-making, and improved outcomes.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job articulating the value proposition of the seller's company and product, but there were a few missed opportunities to provide more specific and concrete examples of how the seller's solutions can help the customer.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. ""How many people are we talking about on those two teams?"" The sales rep asked this question to better understand the customer's needs and to help determine the appropriate number of user licenses. The customer seemed more engaged because they provided specific numbers and details about the team structure.
2. ""Is there any distinction between like a kind of management type user?"" This question was asked to clarify the customer's requirements for user roles and access levels. The customer's response showed increased engagement as they inquired about the specifics of user management.
3. ""What would be like the split between the solutions?"" The sales rep asked this question to understand the customer's budget and priorities for each solution. The customer's response demonstrated engagement as they discussed the potential allocation of resources for each solution.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The top concerns the customer had about the seller's product were related to the cost and the feasibility of implementing the solution for their organization. The customer asked for a more detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each of the four buckets (CRM, [ORG-3], Marketing, and Implementation) and expressed that the range provided by the seller (260 to a million dollars) was quite significant. The customer also mentioned that they would need to consider the return on investment for each of the buckets.

Additionally, the customer expressed some uncertainty about the Marketing solution, as their current solution was working reasonably well. They mentioned that they would need to think more about or discuss further how they might collaborate across their two functional areas (resource mobilization and communications) to optimize the use of the Marketing tools.

Lastly, the customer had some questions about the implementation process and the role of a third-party implementation team, which would be an additional line item in their budget. They wanted to ensure that the implementation partner was located in a time zone that was convenient for their organization and that they had a good working relationship with the partner.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide sufficient information to determine if the correct decision maker was on the call or to identify who the correct person would be. Additionally, there are no explicit next steps agreed upon during the call. The seller proposed some dates for future calls, but it is not clear if these were confirmed or accepted by the customer.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They were open to scheduling follow-up meetings and involving more people from their organization in the discussions. They also expressed interest in understanding the ROI of the proposed solutions. However, they did mention the need to consider budget constraints and the importance of working with a partner located in a suitable time zone. Overall, they seemed engaged and interested in moving forward with the process.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: Yes, the customer seemed to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They mentioned that the product fits well with their core areas of program that need support and would benefit their fundraising, grant management, and project management teams. However, they also expressed a need to understand the solution better and involve their team members in the process.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the potential of the seller's product to help them collaborate internally, build strong programs, deliver those programs, measure their impact, and report back to funders. They specifically mentioned the value of having a single source of truth for all constituent information and the ability to use the collaboration tool for communication and planning within their global team. The customer also appreciated the seller's background in the nonprofit space and their shared passion for environmental causes.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's current communication and engagement strategy, particularly for the communications team. They mentioned that their goals are different from the resource mobilization team, focusing on thought leadership and driving the conversation around global change. The rep could have asked more questions to uncover specific pain points, challenges, and goals in this area.
2. The rep could have delved deeper into the customer's existing social listening solution and how it is used to monitor and analyze conversations around their research and publications. This would help identify opportunities for improvement and demonstrate the value of the proposed tools in addressing the customer's needs.
3. The rep could have asked about the customer's experience with [ORG-16] and how it is currently used for managing [ORG-14] accounts. This information would help the rep tailor their approach and recommendations for implementing and scaling the CRM system within the organization.
4. The rep could have inquired about the customer's budgeting process and timeline to better understand their constraints and priorities. This would enable the rep to provide more accurate pricing information and tailor their proposal to fit the customer's financial requirements.
5. The rep could have asked about the customer's experience with digital transformation projects in the past, including any successes or challenges they encountered. This information would help the rep understand the customer's readiness for change and tailor their approach to address any concerns or reservations.

By spending more time understanding the customer's needs, the sales rep can build a stronger relationship, provide more targeted recommendations, and increase the likelihood of a successful partnership.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep asked several open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions include:
- ""What do you clarify [PERSON-1]?"" (to encourage the customer to ask questions and express their concerns)
- ""Thoughts so far on what we're talking about?"" (to gauge the customer's initial reaction to the presentation)
- ""How many people are we talking about on those two teams?"" (to gather more information about the customer's team size and structure)
- ""What kind of questions does it bring up as we're looking at the screen right now?"" (to understand if there are any specific areas of concern or interest)
- ""How does this resonate with you?"" (to gauge the customer's overall impression of the presentation)
- ""What are the main areas of your program that you'd like to see supported?"" (to identify the customer's specific needs and requirements)
- ""Is there any distinction between like a kind of management type user?"" (to clarify the customer's understanding of the licensing structure)
- ""What do we need? What can we afford?"" (to understand the customer's budget constraints and priorities)
- ""What are the key priorities?"" (to ensure that the solution aligns with the customer's needs)
- ""Any feedback on this, [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5], to make sure we're going down the right path?"" (to ensure that the solution meets the customer's expectations)
- ""What exactly that would work, possibly?"" (to understand the customer's specific requirements for collaborative spaces)
- ""Any questions or initial reactions?"" (to gauge the customer's overall impression of the presentation)

These open-ended questions demonstrate that the sales rep is actively seeking to understand the customer's needs, concerns, and priorities. By asking these questions, the sales rep is able to tailor the presentation to the customer's specific requirements and build a stronger rapport with the customer."
video_19790_167_6qr3y000000g3O2AAI,"Agent: After Yeah, okay, so first of all, thank you for being here.
Agent: You Daniel.
Agent: I think that I already met some of you [DATE-1] during when you were in motion guys and we already saw together something around, you know, energy cloud and if I don't go wrong, I mean, you are currently using it for some aspects of your business.
Agent: So talking with [PERSON-1], We decided that [PERSON-2] was asking us to give some updates on the solution, on the vertical solution, and maybe also focus a little bit on the subscription management path.
Agent: The gap of data is that we can eventually leverage in energy that is proud to implement this subscription management. So, let me just, okay.
Agent: So that is the idea of the agenda, but obviously we can, we can be so much interactivists we need and let's try that and because maybe some of you already know part of the solution.
Agent: Some of you not, I'm not sure who is up to date to which level. So eventually we can skip or focus on other aspects based on what are your interests.
Agent: So as you know, I mean, the idea of the solution in general from sales forces with verticals is to provide a further step towards the final solutions to customers, in the sense that normally says what's our main product, the [PRODUCT-1] product, or say it's service Marketing and so on, is quite a general, so it can be used by many companies for different kinds of businesses.
Agent: And the approach was to, through acquisition, like the acquisition of velocity, that is the previous, the company that will bring it in some of the vertical, based software base, but also developing and increasing and improving the solution.
Agent: Successful services trying to produce us some verticals like the energy one that will reduce the amount of work you need to do to reach your objectives.
Agent: Some of the things are already there, like on the data model is extended, some processes are already presented with a template and so on and so forth. We will see.
Agent: So this is the objective of this vertical to reduce the time to... to the value that you're going to have with the projects .
Agent: If you have any general question on, on energy ground as a vertical, feel free to, to ask, I mean, me and [PERSON-3] will be glad to answer.
Agent: So, during [DATE-2], we have, every, every year we have three releases.
Agent: And the idea behind this is as face-forces in general is doing with the [PRODUCT-1] is to provide new capabilities, okay?
Agent: Following what is mostly the market need in the sense that we collect obviously requests from several customers and we have a team internally of product management that is trying to provide the new [PRODUCT-2] and the solution to, and there are also other kind of efforts not only from a product.
Agent: Point of view of improving and increasing the solution, but also to make it better and t o make it more standard.
Agent: So what is the meaning of this?
Agent: So say it's also in the latest, I think mostly in [DATE-3] . is trying to simplify and normalize the solution.
Agent: So if there is already a product or a sub product that is providing a functionality, says for us it's trying to say, OK, this is the solution. We will not build other solutions for the same aspect.
Agent: And this means as an example that, as an example, you remember, I don't know if you have seen us energy clouds, but that's an example. We'll also be provided.
Agent: Of a flex card or a card called the customer story. That is like the story about the operations that you did with the customer, the goals, the opportunities, the cases.
Agent: Now, because this was already another aspect, another gadget that is called the timeline, that is essentially the same thing. So, energy go out now is adopted the timeline. So, this is just to say normalization of the solution.
Agent: The other aspect is moving to core. This means that most of the modules and capabilities from energy to this cloud are being migrated technically into the platform.
Agent: So no more context classes, but [GPE-1] libraries and part of the [GPE-1] platform. And this is happening piece by piece, is not one shot, as you can imagine.
Agent: As an example, the other model is one aspect, and this part is integrated.
Agent: [PERSON-1] says, as first, stands for [ORG-1]. So let's see a little bit of truthless life.
Agent: So this is the last one, essentially after the acquisition, the salesforce decided to rename and brand the broader task energy in this cloud before that was just developed resolution. And then we started launching some new stuff at release.
Agent: We tried to highlight the main ones with bold charters, but essentially. There are several things that cannot be resumed in a single couple of slides.
Agent: So there has been an effort to start producing some already built applications for some use cases, like for use cases for call center agents or use cases for the customer acquisition through the digital portals, the self-service portals and so on and so on.
Agent: So [ORG-2] has produced some of these applications already done that you can [PERSON-4], welcome. And we would see some of them more in [DATE-4].
Agent: Then there is, as you, as [PERSON-1] was asking about, I saw first also a verticalization of field service. This means that the [ORG-2] horizontal solution for [ORG-3] has been increased with some new licenses and capabilities.
Agent: And as an example, you know, the most ingredients for [ORG-4] users, the contractors that are not using directly the [PRODUCT-1] to access also the extended data model. the building that is happening .
Agent: Go to the next slide . that is happening in the latest period of some prepared work cycles and mobile flows for typical field work from technical agents that are working on the field and so on.
Agent: So there is a set of licenses for [ORG-3] that is verticalized to allow you to provide those other energy discoveries like using an omni-script or accessing the model and so on.
Agent: Another thing that is quite relevant, probably you already are, if you are using the vertical you should know it, is that from [EVENT-1], we also have a launch into the program for automatic upgrades.
Agent: So this means that if you onboard on this program, you will not need to upgrade the managed package yourself for every version. But [ORG-2] will take care of upgrading the package.
Agent: Ok, so I don't know if you already know this or not. Okay.
Agent: Then what else?
Agent: There are some other things like we will see in the next slide, but essentially, you know, the roadmap is progressing. In [DATE-5], as I was saying, there are some main, obviously, investment pillars.
Agent: So one of them is to to go to code, okay, and this is really taking a lot of efforts from our engineers because I can't repeat what is.
Agent: Another model, all the APIs for the CPU as an example have been moved to code. Most of them are already moved.
Agent: What else?
Agent: The only studio, only studio, so the set of the like on-microcript cards and so on and so forth, is there is now a standard Code version that is just using Code objects. And it still exists the package version.
Agent: But obviously to adapt to energy ground to work completely with the core solution of our new studio, there has been and is still not finished [DATE-6].
Agent: I think [DATE-7], would be the final [ORG-5] of the solution and the fence. Because some of the technical aspects behind the velocity assets like the car for [ORG-6] or other aspects, they are not easy.
Agent: In the sense, they use namespaces, they use a lot of... Code behind it, so to adapt it to work with the [PERSON-5] s in the standard, it took like one year You should be done now We are just waiting
Speaker 4: For a go from product managemen t to say, let's say to the customer to [ORG-7] e to [PERSON-6] in the standard.net to you . Yes, actually.
Speaker 4: When you're saying that right now it's using namespaces, what will change because still will get [PRODUCT-3]: As a managed package, right?
Agent: So it's still it will be using the namespaces or will be changing the backend objects for [ORG-8]. No, well, OK, so from from a point of view of the managed package, yes, it's still there and.
Agent: Or it will be there for some time yet. Now there is a long term plan, we don't have timelines to remove it completely. Okay.
Agent: So at the moment, you have the package installed and you can choose if to use package on the studio like a nine space, you know, runtime, designer and so on, or the standard one.
Agent: Until the latest version, if you choose to go for standard, there are some limitations, there are some considerations in the documentation, say before doing it, check this, because maybe you are using something that is not still supported with standard.
Agent: But the effort to support everything is going on, and I hope that
Agent: [DATE-8] will be there on the target layer line.
Speaker 4: I believe that recharge already opted
Agent: In for the auto renewal. Yeah, that is already there. For the push upgrades. Yeah, yeah, okay, but that is not that process is not forcing you to choose standard only studio or package on the studio.
Agent: You decide they will not change anything my great to I don't know if I pronounce wrong to your name.
Speaker 4: Automatically. To migrate to
Agent: No, it's correct. That's okay. the migration to standard on this video takes some effort in the sense that you need to take several of the only scripts and cards and so on and send it tool.
Speaker 4: Through the migration
Agent: In a sense that it's not a one-click migration, okay?
Agent: It takes a little bit of time, unfortunately. The current, you know that, for a moment to the next slide.
Speaker 4: Let's go now
Agent: I mentioned the fact that there are some applications that are provided already built. So there is, after the goal, I can send you the documentation of scanning how to reach this.
Agent: Now, essentially, if you go on help.setsus.com for energy, it's probably you will find the instructions. So these applications are like a substitution for the old concept of process library. We don't have and maintain the process library anymore.
Agent: What we do is that we produce this application and we maintain and update and release these applications. As a separate set from the baggage, so they are not inside the managed baggage yet.
Agent: And you can access this algorithm, generate one org with this solution, and then evaluate if you like some of the parts of the thing is applicable to your business, you can just migrate.
Agent: There are instructions to migrate these solutions to your sandbox. And then from the sandbox, you modify, adjust, and release. And these are currently using a sort of mid- they're using a MySQL standard. already now.
Agent: But there is like a sort of mid middle time flag enabled saying support also the managed package on the studio.
Agent: So some of the parts of the assets are on the streets and flags cards are in the new version and some are still on the other side.
Agent: So that just to keep in mind in the case you want to adopt some of these solutions and migrate them. Okay, so this is more or less very high level situation at the moment.
Agent: Most of these models were already present at the time of when you adopted the energy cloud. So, as an example, the business models like [ORG-6], the product catalog and the other management.
Agent: I'm not sure if you are using the digital commerce module. I will explain to you what is this.
Agent: But it's essentially a set of APIs to expose the CPU capabilities on digital channels, on a scalable way and other capabilities.
Agent: But something that probably was not there and I don't know if you are informal about is a full set of industry, common components and our service excellence, [ORG-2] service We will see something.
Agent: But as an example, we did not within the CPU. Now we are also able to use the rules engine instead of the old calculation models and calculation procedures. The rules engine is the target solution where [ORG-9] is converting.
Agent: Sorry, it's directing everyone because it's containing the [ORG-10] to work on any object on [ORG-2] and this build some decision metrics that can be used in several areas and decision tables.
Agent: So it's similar to the idea of calculation, modeling, and calculation procedures, but it's more general and more powerful. It's called a business rules engine.
Agent: Currently, if you look up your own, I am quite sure and you look up the licenses. and the permission set licenses that you have.
Agent: You wouldn't notice that you have a lot of permission set licenses that you probably are not using. The latest that was released was like [PRODUCT-1] analytics.
Agent: That is a successful product for [PERSON-7] data analytics that has been automatically given to everyone that has energy in this cloud because it's part of the new releases.
Agent: But also you will notice things like the arc that is like the relationship center, that is substituting the old velocity graphs or you know, are there no action templates, that is like the action plans, that is a way to establish something place for action plan that would be used to generate tasks for people working on some specific applications and reverse notes.
Agent: So there are seven things that obviously we cannot see all of them, but.. . And by the way, the list of these applications. So we have one application for all of them are in the same arc.
Agent: So if you go and generate an argument, you will find all of them. But the documentation is in different chapters. So there is a full set of processes and solution for the Customer409 contact center console for the agent.
Agent: There is a solution that is being improved now with the new capabilities for the customer acquisition portal. Thank you.
Agent: Full flow using the digital commerce to acquire an anonymous mode, a new account, create an order and so on and so forth with a portal built on obviously an experienced cloud. So it's fun.
Agent: There is an application for large accounts management.
Agent: So I don't know if this part of the capability is being used a lot of the moment in [ORG-13], but the CPU has been improved in the latest versions with some dedicated flows and data model to manage multi-site quotes and orders.
Agent: So if you have like customers in large accounts that are asking for.
Agent: I don't know, here, installing chargers, as an example, in several places, you can quote all of them together, okay?
Agent: And then have a sort of structural master quote and some quotes with groups, like you can say, okay, for this CD, for these 10 service points, I will deliver this charger, with this subscription, with this product and service.
Agent: And for this other group, it will be different. And then this can be attributed eventually with external pricing engine if you need it, and so on and so forth. And this flows through from now.
Agent: Code to order, so you can then generate order for each service point of order for the group and so on . And this application, the larger accounts as management is providing a console dedicated to managing the large account.
Agent: These are self-supporting, completely built with [PRODUCT-4] cards and the new studio capabilities and the current to adopt the, I don't remember the clear name, but [DATE-9], let's say experience model that is completely renewed and essentially is exposing the data and the processes for self-service for consumer accounts.
Agent: So this portal is providing you an example on how to build a self-service portal with, on with [ORG-13]. to access your bills, your consumption, change of service, or things like that.
Agent: And this one instead is a new set of capabilities around the energy efficiency of clean. I mean, in general, I'm not restricted to clean energy, but program management.
Agent: So the gap ability to, that has been hard, that the two energy described in the latest couple of versions and I think it's [ORG-5] now completely with the food solution that includes the possibility to build the full capabilities to manage energy programs.
Agent: So as an example, energy community, so you know, new energy, clean energy programs, where you can market the campaign, you can expose to digital channels of these programs and onboard new customers, you can track internally and also from a customer point of view, as an example, the CO2 settings, and it has a soft, you know, cardboard.
Agent: Footprint and savings respect to [ORG-17] for solar panel s of new talk .
Agent: We can go more in [DATE-4], but it's related to the possibility to manage programs through the digital channels, and hold the data model behind the scenes to track and manage the program internally. Okay.
Agent: So time is running a lot from. So what I want to say, we can do. I have some other slide, but probably maybe one thing is about digital commerce that you don't know, that we can.
Agent: But then what I was thinking is, I have a demo that is essentially the same demo that we use at the. [DATE-10], if you want to see some ideas around subscription.
Agent: But maybe most of you already saw this demo, and there is also a video around. So you tell me if you want to see the demo.
Agent: The other thing is showing you the differences between, or let's say the differences, the innovations, in the sense that we're talking about the new, only studio new customer 409, new capability for the [ORG-6].
Agent: There is a new card, because there is a new card for [ORG-6] that I don't know if you are using it or not, and things like that. So that is also an aspect that we can see.
Agent: And, I'm just realizing the damage is very short. So we can do it this through the demo.
Agent: In the sense, we can see some part of the demo, and then I will tell you when something is different now, and that we should in the new console and the new solution.
Agent: Or we can go buy questions to use the rest of the drive. So let me just give you an idea of what is digital commerce.
Agent: So digital commerce is, as I was saying, a set of APIs for exposing CPU capabilities to the digital channels. The idea is we don't want to execute to run for every single call because it's too slow.
Agent: One second is too much for a digital channel with a massive number of users navigating it.
Agent: So there is a set of APIs and there is an architecture based on a file server that will prepare the answers in a sort of way so that if you think to the final of navigation of the users like most of the users are pressing your website and seeing all the offers.
Agent: Only some of them will select one of the offers and only some of them will configure some of the dates and only some of them will as an example buy the offer. All of them.
Agent: Api request to do this operation . The answer to this API request is already prepared in advance by [ORG-2].
Agent: So it's immediate, okay?
Agent: It's just accessing our document in a file server and getting new the JSON reports for these combination of events of what it was an answer, okay?
Agent: And this is also supporting anonymous navigations. So it doesn't need, these APIs are exposed both through the communities or through portal from your site. also to anonymous navigation.
Agent: So anonymous user can ask the [ORG-10] to give me the offer, give me the details of this offer and so on and so forth.
Agent: So the full idea is It needs to be scalable and so for large peaks of rigorous and it needs to support non-musnavigation.
Agent: And so if you want to expose the catalog, the subscriptions and the charges to the digital channels, this is the way to go, okay, without replicating website or somewhere
Speaker 5: The catalog on the else.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-8] may ask a question. Absolutely. About the digital commerce. It still would be good maybe to hear more on the use cases.
Speaker 5: So you just said we can expose subscriptions and products into the digital channels without building the separate touch points, web touch points, applications. I still don't fully understand the use case.
Speaker 6: Maybe you could share a bit more ideas how we can be applied. But eventually, selling them [PERSON-9], it's not about post sale.
Speaker 6: It's just if someone wants to buy certain products, we basically have this catalog of products where we define, you know, name other features price. And then we can expose them, for example, on a website.
Speaker 6: And then people can buy it. That's the first part. I don't think it has this, because this is a digital commerce related thing.
Speaker 5: I don't think it has anything to do with
Agent: Post sale.
Speaker 6: What happens?
Speaker 6: That's to do it for the understand.
Speaker 6: There's an API in [ORG-2], we would be able to add all the products that we need, via the API we expose them and we can integrate them on a website if we need to sell products.
Speaker 6: So let's say if we would be selling charge points on a website directly, then we can expose those details about the charge points via the API.
Agent: Yeah, I think [PERSON-10] is showing here.
Agent: As an example, this is a community, you know, okay?
Agent: And this one that we are seeing when I press New Gasmer is an old omniscript.
Agent: An omniscript, I don't know if you know, exactly what it is but it's a sequence of steps that you can design currently, currently if you, if you, this is a new org, okay, with the new version of the energy release cloud and as an example this is an on-script.
Agent: So you come here and use, you put here some you know actions or some screens, some fields and so on and so forth.
Agent: So you define a flow very, very easily and then you can expose this on any channel, let's say on [ORG-2] agents, on communities, or we don't, given that it's compiling our [ORG-17], our web component, it would be running any browser page together inside another [ORG-18] or another portal, okay?
Agent: And when this only scripts is running here, and it reaches this step, okay?
Agent: Sorry. is not, I mean the Omelet script is not contained in this definition of products. These are coming from the... energy grab catalog and [ORG-6].
Agent: And our own script or your website or any other mobile operation can know this. It's doing an API call.
Agent: But this API call, as an example, is saying, I am from this channel, and I don't know, passing some context information and say, give me the offer, which are the offer, which is the description, what is the image, or what is the price, and what will be the price.
Agent: This [ORG-17] is not, it's from digital commerce, [ORG-17] said, and it's not running the [ORG-6] as if you are in a cart configuring a normal.
Agent: It's just giving you back the answer immediately because it's pretty often needed, okay?
Agent: So this kind of architecture can, as [PERSON-1] was saying, it's for sales. It's for sales. The sales can also be a not-great sales, so that cross sales.
Agent: So as an example, a customer is already having a charger, and wants to buy another service or you have a subscription. and you want to improve the subscription level or things like that.
Agent: So you can still use digital comments. But it's an architecture to leverage the catalog. So the product catalog that you define, and I would say, a pricing engine and
Speaker 6: The CPU, but in a scalable way. So if I go, Maybe the important piece is that this is mostly relevant for self-serve, for the sales-led process [PERSON-9], which is a lot of what we do.
Speaker 5: Not
Speaker 6: If customers
Speaker 5: Themselves would go and purchase something on the website, that is when using these APIs would be helpful. But for example, we have got it in take where customers open and choose what they want.
Agent: Could it be suitable for us if we develop new got it in take?
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 5: Yeah. And the sense
Agent: That you say that during the intake of the customer is choosing between different offers or configuring an offer. Yeah. Yeah, it's still a self-service, let's say, buy or say, process.
Agent: So, this demo from [DATE-13], was a bit too big to see demo, in the sense that the idea was, okay, you ever... partner that is accessing the partner portal with a customer in front of him and say, okay, this guy wants to buy and there is a contract with your partner.
Speaker 4: One, this old
Agent: So he knows they know they have [PERCENT-1] discount. This is on the product catalog on the contract. Okay.
Agent: But then when, obviously, going to the next step, we had like an email sent to the customer and the customer was doing the intake. but during the intake is just configuring some details.
Agent: This was done with an Omelet script also. If you want, I can show it to you, but essentially it's another Omelet script where the customer is configuring some of these details. Okay. This could be done also again.
Agent: With digital commerce. In the sense that behind the on-script, you can also cool the digital commerce APIs. Maybe you want to show additional options or options. I can use an additional service. or you want to price options.
Agent: So as an example, you want to price that in this case, it was like the color or the mounting type. This kind of things could be also priced, and then they intake with the digital commerce. OK.
Agent: The only thing is that they intake portal should run integrated with the APIs to [ORG-2], OK?
Agent: Yeah. I don't know, really, if you do want to go through the old demo and see the flow.
Agent: So maybe you got ideas on what you want to see or you want to see the new stuff and energy out.
Speaker 6: [PERSON-13], I have a quick question because when we set up the the demo, I also particularly mentioned that I would be interested in seeing what's developed in regards to subscriptions, how we can manage product for sale and also after sale.
Agent: Intention of having
Speaker 6: If the demo is from [DATE-10], I think this requirement is not included there.
Speaker 6: So what I would be interested in seeing is everything related to subscriptions, so I'm wondering what can you show in regards to that?
Agent: Okay, so this, let me just take one. Okay, in this demo already, but then I can show you also in the product design that's something in the new version.
Agent: And this demo was already using, how to say, subscriptions in the [ORG-17].
Agent: At the level of catalog, What we defined at the time was a subscription and [ORG-18] okay charges and subscription they were to separated offense but when Obviously when starting the on when the only script is Creating the org the opportunity It was creating the opportunity with both products.
Agent: Okay, so I don't know if it is readable or it's too small But so in this idea This is a card, okay, so it's like an opportunity, an order being taken for a specific custom, okay?
Agent: It's not the configuration of the subscription itself, it's the selling on the subscription. So as you can see, you can define products and bundles, and you can define regarding pricing.
Agent: You can define multi-brice, or you can define in-ibrice and things like that. And then you can also define, I would say, like, expected, you know.
Agent: End of subscription if it is like something that is allowed to renew it or not. And the baggage in this case, so the charger was a separate product.
Agent: But no one, I mean, you can decide that if you want to bundle things together in the sense, You can decide if it is like a top-down approach.
Agent: So in the sense, I sell this bundle that contains subscriptions and contain charges. And eventually, the customer can choose the options.
Agent: So which charger or which level of subscription?
Agent: Because you can control this with several rules in the CPU. You can decide to, for example, provide a cardinality saying, OK, if you buy the baggage, you need to include a [ORG-17] subscription.
Agent: So this is like bundling things from the start and going up top-down approach. I'm selling packages that are containing everything.
Agent: The other possibility is to define rules so that when I have a customer that has a like, as buying a charger, you can give the option or you can for the same to also buy a subscription.
Agent: There is a knock in the same bundle. But with the [ORG-6], from industry, you can define rules cross products.
Agent: You can say as an example, if I have this kind of subscription, or the baggage will be of this level, or this service will be included also, this kind of rules to automatically, you know, force or drive the cart can be done.
Agent: So, [PERSON-13], from the point of view of... That's what ?
Agent: Simply defining the author and defining the products for subscription is quite, I don't know if there is something in this part that you have questions about because there are, in the subscription management there are several aspects, you know, so it's like defining the offers, combining, you know, them together, pricing them, and then then to end, it also includes,
Speaker 6: You know, activating the subscription, billing the subscription and so on and so forth. So I don't know which interested on, but...
Agent: Aspect you are more
Speaker 6: I posted a list of questions in the chat on the aspects that I'm interested in because of course the sale part is important.
Speaker 6: I think we can see it here for how to add things, how to change the pricing if needed. Bundling is also a separate subject we will bundle things.
Agent: Because sometimes maybe
Speaker 6: Sometimes we want to sell things separately. So I don't We're still much on that want to focus.
Agent: But the three questions that I posted in the cha t would be the most relevant Okay, so the first one is now can we manage sorry, how can we configure subscription product s and what changes ?
Agent: Okay, how you can do it is now, I don't know if you're using it already or not, but now we have the product designer. Okay, so you can define all the different aspects of one offer and a product.
Agent: And essentially if I define a subscription, apart from the of the type, the family blah, and the description, Obviously, you can define attributes and so on and so forth.
Speaker 4: Definition
Agent: It's around pricing, you know. So because you need to also define a regarding price for the subscription, or you can also define both things.
Agent: You can define an activation price plus a regarding So within the pricing tab, you can add different kind of prices.
Speaker 4: Price. Okay.
Speaker 6: This is should be loaded in some kind of a little bit slow.
Speaker 6: And besides pricing, can we define for the same product different types of building schedules?
Speaker 6: Let's say we have a gold subscription, which a customer can buy [DATE-13] or [DATE-17]. But it's the same product. Basically, it's just a different building cycle. And of course, it might have a different price.
Speaker 4: And we
Agent: Set that up here. Yeah, I want to say, let me just take one product to this. I don't understand why this is not loading the prices. Yeah, okay, you can define [DATE-17] or [NORP-1] pricing.
Speaker 4: The choice, sorry, someone is rising an M or?
Speaker 4: Yeah, before you proceed, I just want to say one thing. So we are actually using attributes to define whether the subscription product
Speaker 4: And then using those attributes to decide how it will be built. But if there is anything else that we can use,
Agent: No, well, you mean from up, because we need to distinguish
Speaker 6: A little bit between quote, a face and a billing face, okay?
Speaker 4: The sales or
Speaker 6: So... billing will be done by your billing agent.
Agent: The
Speaker 6: I don't know which one. Correct. Yeah. So it will be done separately, but we can use some details about it. The actual operation of the billing is done separately.
Speaker 6: But how to do the billing or how often can be something that we set up here, because at the moment of sale, we also want to inform the customer that, hey, you know, you
Agent: Chose for the [DATE-17] or for the [DATE-13] billing. And then that can be used. in other downstream systems and other products .
Agent: Yeah, so you need the, I think you need the information in the, in the moment you prepare the order, while you specify, so this could be an attribute, okay, it could be like an attribute saying, the price will happen [DATE-17] or [DATE-13], sorry, the pricing.
Agent: And this is useful for the billing engine, okay, because you pass down an attribute or you pass down, you can, if you want, you can also, I don't know if you're using all the management, but you can also decompose the commercial order and add line items.
Agent: You can add, if your billing system doesn't accept an attribute and they want a line item in the order, you can also automatically add a line item. So this is just to align the billing.
Agent: From a point of view of definition, when you define the pricing here, you have like price list elements. So, as an example, there are different elements. So, you can define an [DATE-13] price and a multiple price.
Agent: And then you can drag and drop here rules. So, you could define a rule saying if the attribute is for pricing is [DATE-13], then this price is valid. During the [PERSON-17], we are still at the [PERSON-17] here.
Agent: If the attribute is like [DATE-17], then the other price. So, This box here, where you can take a rule and drop it there, is a way to have multiple different prices and just choose which one we'll apply.
Agent: So you can define a context rule to identify if it is ill or [DATE-17], and that will drive the selection of the price on the rotation time.
Agent: And the same attribute can be passed down to the billing, or to 13 the billing act in the correct way, so in the sense that we'll apply the correct scheduling for the bills and the calculations.
Agent: This is one easy way for this example requirement. Obviously, the pricing in here at the quotation time can also happen in another way. There is a there is a pricing that is called attribute pricing.
Agent: Okay, so when the CPU is running during the water or hotbed building, is a product thing called a pricing plan. Okay, pricing plan
Speaker 4: Is a sequence of steps. Now, let me see if I can show you.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, using it. So.
Speaker 4: Yeah, also, it's actually for the sake of understanding of everyone. I will just show. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Agent: So when you add some products in the cart, all the prices calculated. This price, the pricing plan is executed.
Agent: So this means that there are some standard steps, okay, like load the price of [DATE-10], apply contact to the <inaudible>, blah, blah.
Agent: And it's like a waterfall, OK?
Agent: So things are happening in sequence. But you can, and normally, these things are provided by sites of itself. You can download these procedures and add it here. You can add some steps here.
Agent: And in this case, as an example, for the demo, or this step is calculating the price for some data. of boiler or let's say warming plant for the house, this is calculating some other price.
Agent: So what this means that is taking the product, taking the car, taking all the attributes and doing some logic with business rules engine or with the old calculation procedure. and calculating the price dynamically without using average or code.
Agent: These procedures behind these steps are applying some more complex logic. If the product is pricing by these steps, it will not be over-read and by the other steps. You have these two different options, what I wanted to highlight.
Agent: You can define different prices on the price list.
Agent: And assign a rule to decide which one will apply, or you can leave the pricing for those particular products and subscriptions to our procedure, the business rules engine, that is very powerful and can really use the attributes and other fields from [ORG-2] to calculate the price.
Agent: As an example, to give you more complex examples, there are these, the attribute pricing is used for situations very complex like target margin pricing.
Agent: As an example, the agent is putting the margin in an attribute in the card saying, I want to do [PERCENT-2] margin.
Agent: We go to this category is also getting not only in the price, but also the cost, you know, and the. The attribute price is in book using this value [PERCENT-2] to calculate which should be the price you should
Agent: Sell the product to the customer. So it's very powerful and you, sorry, I know, I didn't see your problem. I was just, I just wanted to ask a question [PERSON-10] also mentioned that she's using this already.
Agent: Because
Agent: And to ask [PERSON-17] because she had those three questions like.
Agent: Is it clear how you can configure subscription products and how you can use triggers for activation?
Speaker 6: I think we didn't yet talk about the activations. So in our maybe to answer one of those question, Thank you.
Speaker 6: In our previous calls, I did mention that I saw from the team some demos for how to use things.
Speaker 6: So I think that's what also [PERSON-18] is referring to because we are using this for different types of products and also for subscriptions. But I don't think we are using it to the full potential that we can.
Speaker 6: And of course, we want to understand if maybe something changed in the meantime that we also don't know.
Speaker 6: Because It could be that you, for example, from a product direction, decided to have more informatio n about the billing as standard fields or properties that exist for products, for example, if the y are subscription products, and we use them as a custom attribute So those are also the nuances that we want to understand
Agent: If maybe we are using thing s in the right way, or there's a better way for how to do that . Yeah, I mean, no.
Agent: In this aspect, there has not been a big changes, apart from introducing the business through [PERSON-17] and [ORG-17].
Agent: Well, the recommendation is if attributes are very better, if you don't need 10 line items, because the other approach is to define, sub products inside the bundle, technical products, to pass this information to the billion.
Agent: But attributes and fields are probably more, how to say, dynamic and configurable. And the attribute price in engine is working on attributes and fields. So it's the way to go, I think you're doing the right thing.
Agent: If this is working with your building, in the sense that you don't need to add other products inside the bundle just for the building, then attribute is the right choice.
Agent: And I don't know if this answers your question, I don't know about here, but I think attribute to, I don't know which other information from the building you have in mind, but, way, the attribute is a good way to characterize the broadened so that it can be sold and be lived in the right way.
Agent: And then how to trigger a subscription activation?
Agent: I mean, when you define, when you go on after you sell something like a subscription, the process is passing through the creation of...
Agent: I would say, are you using all the management guys or not?
Agent: Because all the management is the other feature, not the two we have. that is working after the sales phase. So it's decomposing the order into technical elements.
Agent: So you can add and decompose this order producing additional information for the different systems and then orchestrate all the flows.
Agent: So you can invoke like other systems in a synchronous or as in [GPE-2], you can assign tasks and so on and so forth.
Agent: And this is where... You can also logic without coding to decide the dates of activation, and when to inform, as an example, the billing to start a billing for the customer and so on and so forth.
Speaker 4: Apply
Agent: If you are not using the management, obviously, you need to build something custom, because... the, I would say you have the possibility to decide the date for the order, but it's one date for all the line items.
Agent: So if you sell a charger, you need to ship it and then you need to activate, start activating the subscription, after the installation and the activation of the charger.
Agent: This kind of dependency needs to be managed manually or with the custom development. Hot-term management is said they're able to do this in the sense that you, you can just define the, on the plants.
Agent: Maybe, maybe if you want, if you are interested in hot-term management, we can do a dedicated session, so I can show you the go-up business, but that this is the main scope of hot-term management.
Speaker 6: So, managing the, the activation, the fulfillment of the different aspects of the sales order once submitted to the system.
Speaker 4: So, a quick question to you regarding disorder management. Are these the orders that we are using
Speaker 6: Or is it something different?
Speaker 7: Order
Agent: Management uses those orders, but it's a completely different process. We are not using anything related to order management. Okay, yeah.
Agent: The object is the standard audit, but then obviously the management has capabilities and uses some other, let's say, object to maintain the fulfillment request and the situation of the frustration and so on.
Agent: And so this is also related to your latest question, [PERSON-13], what happens in post sales?
Agent: What solution for managing the infirmities of the management?
Agent: And then post sales also means having assets. So if you go to any of these accounts, at the end you have some active assets as an example.
Agent: This is the new console, okay?
Agent: A little bit more respect to the respect. to the Odu tens . that you see is very poor and very old, you know, it has been avoided a lot.
Agent: And, but anyway, you have the assets, okay, these are customers, for example, as I do a few, then as a charger install, and in the asset level, okay, this is a cut, but if I go to the record, did you see the full, the full records?
Agent: If I take one of the existing assets, so,
Agent: You can define the asset level all the details, like the kind of products when it was activated, when it's expired in case of a subscription, what is the price, what is it's stolen, and so on and so forth.
Agent: And the asset is the place where you maintain the subscription. Okay. And then you should the energy cloud solution is providing capabilities to. upsell or renew the subscription, or change the offer level through the [ORG-6] depends.
Agent: I mean, if you need [ORG-6] to calculate New Pricing or things like that, then [ORG-6] is involved with other <inaudible> you have just like renewing the contractor.
Agent: This processes are, you already have templates around this process as an explanation and I'll do it, but it's possible to focus in on the asset, maintain all the boss sales processes, okay?
Agent: If you want like, if the customer is like wants to cancel the subscription or if you need to renew it and so on and so forth.
Agent: Given the time is very short, I just, I don't know, the other thing is also you, I think, Obviously, I
Speaker 5: Am sure you have a lot of questions that we need to manage to answer this. [PERSON-17], maybe one comment from my site. We are now using [PRODUCT-5]. Well, not everywhere. We just bought it in the [GPE-3].
Speaker 5: We already bring some nice opportunities, but still, I would say, our business team is hunger to see more. And I know that, and I fully support [PERSON-1], which [DATE-17]'s topic about subscription.
Speaker 5: Don't want to stall time for that [DATE-17].
Speaker 5: It would be good if we probably plan something else to learn more about order management, order fulfillment, what we see now on the screen, how it can complement energy cloud features on the functionalities.
Agent: I consider that the energy cloud is quite independent, but I think that's the answer. If you want, we have alpha now, still.
Speaker 5: If you want, we can see it now. But only if it fits to the main topic of [DATE-17]'s meeting, I see. I saw [PERSON-1]'s questions, three questions in the chat.
Agent: If they are covered, we can go if not, I would... Yeah, [PERSON-1] also asked us [DATE-18] some experience from other customers, maybe... So we have a lot of customers.
Agent: I remember because in [GPE-4], that our [ORG-25] story that would be published very soon is around the disk customer here.
Agent: It is a subsidiary company from an L, there is the merger energy provider in [GPE-4]. This company.
Agent: Sorry to interrupt you, but before you start, I just want to quickly ask [PERSON-1] how she would like to proceed because last time we scheduled this meeting, you also asked for a reference case for customer, see how other customers are using it in different industry and while you've mentioned like them electricity or energy industry relates most to you.
Agent: I just want to know if we should cover that and if.
Speaker 6: We also covered the questions you had in regards before we start this session. So I think the two other things, but I will make an assumption.
Speaker 6: So regarding the triggers, if we want to define various conditions for activating the subscription, let's say we activate upon payment, or reactivate
Agent: The subscription the subscription upon charge point installation. My answer is that we can use attributes for that. I can answer you quickly to this, Sotrian. So from a [ORG-6], we'll cut our point of view.
Agent: When you are in the public designer, you define the prices. Okay. You've been here. Let me see what it is. Come on. Let me try it, well, I've done you guys. There is a way to define time plans.
Agent: And time, let me let me see it here. [ORG-26] plans, point one, so long. [ORG-26] plans and time policies, okay.
Agent: This means you can decide As an example, when is the starting event?
Agent: Okay.
Agent: You can see there is an example here. So as an example, this one is from [DATE-17] to the end of plan. Okay. All you can decide that is from the first building.
Agent: This is obvious, not showing the diamond plants in the right way. Ah, this should be here, oh, I'm not here. Ah, sorry, it's in the glass in the same
Agent: Way. This is a diamond plant, and a tiny pole is this. Oh, come on.
Agent: So you say, as an example, the start time is the purchase date, but this could be like the first billing date, or [DATE-17].
Agent: So you can customize or configure these elements, okay?
Agent: And also the end time. And then you associate the policy with also with the plan.
Agent: So one plan is like the duration, okay?
Agent: So as an example, this one is for [DATE-18] in terms of [DATE-17], but you could define different duration.
Agent: When you define a price within the catalog, you can also, or a discount or any kind of pricing element, you can associate a time-plan and a time policy. Okay, this is still a configuration.
Agent: And as I said, you say, this is happening on the catalog, and then this information can be passed down to the building. So the building will know when to start the building of the...
Agent: And the other answer is using all the management in the sense that without the management, you can define more complex logic to decide when to start the subscription.
Agent: So from a point of view of defining information for the pricing, for the billing, you have time clients and time policies. From a point of view of physical, let's say, real activation of the first time, management.
Agent: You can use all the
Agent: I don't remember if I ever plan here, but I don't think so.
Agent: But essentially, the plan is like, okay, after this, in this demo was after this, the selection is confirmed of the charger, then start also the subscription building and activate the subscription. Without the management, you
Agent: Can do this kind of... So, just to clarify, right now they don't have order management in use, so, to trigger the subscription activation, they can use time plans and time policies, which is already available for them.
Agent: And they can also use order management for that. They have an extended use of capabilities, but it's in the order management piece, which is now not available for them. Just distinguish those two. What's available, you, [PERSON-18].
Agent: And what's not available. Okay, yeah.
Agent: Thank We'll talk to you soon. Okay,
Speaker 5: Yeah. Anuk and saying available for them, you mean us, [ORG-28], our sales team.
Speaker 6: Okay, clear. Anything that means we have
Speaker 4: Not purchased it.
Speaker 5: Yeah, we don't have the license.
Speaker 5: For all the management, you mean?
Speaker 5: Yeah. But Anuk, what you just said, there are two options either to use this What is what is called time frames, not time.
Agent: Policies, policies or the management.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. And to clarify With time two things and time policies, you work on a specific product like, I don't know, the subscription itself.
Speaker 5: A little bit, what is the difference?
Agent: So you define a time plan and time policy for the subscription. Without the management, you can instead define a logic that is based on the order for film. To give you the same example.
Agent: So if you as an example are getting a new account in your [PERSON-17] that is applying for a new charger and for a subscription.
Agent: And you want to say, look, I will need to do all the steps to visit the customer, ship the charger and install it and verify it's active.
Agent: And then I want to start the activation of the subscription afterwards, and then I want to start the billing afterwards. This kind of dependence, this kind of logic for the full progress, can only be defined without the manager.
Agent: It's not something you can do with that time plan or time policy.
Agent: The time plan and time policy is just for the single product, okay?
Agent: It's just defining a model of
Speaker 5: Pricing and that you can use for activation for the single product. So with all the management, it's more naturally embedded into the customer
Agent: Journey of furthering, if I can say like that. And, And yeah, and it's accelerated in the Dine 2 market for the new [PRODUCT-6] and offers because it's dynamically built in the plan, depending on some rules.
Agent: So if [DATE-17] you want to bundle as an example, the same charger with a different subscription or with additional services, you don't need to rebuild the full plan. You just combine together the things in the catalog.
Agent: And the other management will take care to analyze the composition of the commercial order and decide which is the flow to follow up and when to activate and subscription, for example.
Agent: As we were saying, maybe we can do a dedicated session for the management because it's, or we can start seeing something now to give you on a level of what is it.
Speaker 5: If I may very quickly, silly question, you mentioned [ORG-8] as an instrument, as part of [PRODUCT-5], we discussed it before. And also, order fulfillment module provides kind of a workflow.
Speaker 5: And if I'm not mistaken, [ORG-8] also provides automation via customized workflow. can we use instead [ORG-8] to build a proper order flow and also support subscription activation triggers and renewal triggers.
Agent: How they match each other, only studio and all the fulfill. No, I'm only studio contains only scripts for defining flows. Okay, but an only script is an interactive flow.
Agent: It's not something that is can run standalone on a server. It's just a flow that runs on customer engagement channels, or agent in front of the agent or in front of the customer. Okay, I'm the browser.
Agent: The other management is that gives you the ability to define long running or long term orchestration plans. And it will run,
Agent: One process could [DATE-25] and will be giving you the capability to wait. for an update from our channel or from another system, and then decide which step to do, assign tasks to other people.
Agent: So it's really from an architectural point of view of the solution is completely different aspect.
Agent: So I'm going to skip this just to define a session with steps for a user, like different forms, collecting information, showing you some offers.
Speaker 4: And loading documents so it's an interactive thing running on the browser. [PERSON-9] just to let you know [ORG-28] is something that we use like the tech team used to. give use of the guided.
Speaker 4: Those the one that you see for frame contract right now. It's built
Speaker 5: On.
Speaker 5: I think, actually, I understand you. We do not hear you well. Sometimes it's breaking your voice. But what I've heard that we are all the users in only [ORG-18], or we're going to use it journey, for
Speaker 4: For the sales our inside sales users.
Speaker 7: And it will also be useful multi-contract delivery. Yeah, we are using it. At [DATE-26], we develop.
Agent: Anyhow. Go ahead. We develop on top of the next.
Agent: Yes, unfortunately, your voice is breaking, but I think the message, I think that was clear here. So, if I go to
Agent: One of the accounts here, so an obvious clip is like a process that is running on a sales channel or could be also for the services. So, as I simply say here, I don't know, claim.
Agent: Let's see if it works. So the thing that is starting now is an omni-script. So it's a guided process for the user. It could be an internal user or an external user. But it's self-contained within the user session.
Agent: It's not something that runs behind the scenes for [DATE-28], waiting for something or synchronizing with other systems without user interaction. Instead, the order management is doing this.
Agent: Order management is setting up a full-on orchestration plan when you submit an order as an example.
Agent: They compose the order to multiple elements, and then we start. create the plan and automatically send in the steps forward. Okay, let me show you.
Agent: But before doing this, as [ORG-25] was mentioning, [PERSON-1], you also asked about one other customer story, or
Speaker 6: Maybe some reference, so I don't know what we want to do first now in [TIME-1].
Speaker 6: Do we want to see a little bit of this story?
Speaker 6: Or we want to go to show a little bit of the management?
Speaker 6: So regarding the customer, what I mentioned last time is particularly I'm interested to see examples of customers that have both a subscription and hardware elements. So if this fits the profile, we can take a quick look.
Agent: And then maybe we can see if we have time to look at order management. I think our meeting is until 13. So we only have [TIME-2]. No, OK.
Agent: The story that we provided is about this customer called Grisper ties. That is an another company. What they are doing is they produce meters and other hardware devices. for the energy distributors around [LOC-1].
Agent: So, the customers are green doberados. Small or medium or green doberados. So, they are like this, they sell the artwork, but obviously they sell it also other products. like services and support and so on and so forth.
Agent: And this includes regarding, you know, subscription-based services and one-time price services. So one of our services.
Agent: And they started, I think it was like, [DATE-28], now they are live from some time, at the beginning they had a lot of, you know, [ORG-28], you know, and a lot of manual operations.
Agent: And they adopted the energy in this cloud. There has been like a project that in [DATE-18], bring it to, to, to be live with the full end to end solution in the sense.
Agent: Not only the selling, but also, you know, the provisioning, the billing, all the part of your own prospecting.
Agent: So we can, if you want, also put you in contact with the our team because the, the main project was driven also with our group of [ORG-34].
Agent: Okay, so we have very good insights and knowledge about some questions.
Speaker 6: Yes, sorry for interrupting you, [PERSON-10].
Speaker 6: I am wondering if you have any customer examples where it's a combination of software and hardware because for an energy provider in this case, I'm not sure how the subscription fits in their scenario because Of course, they can have an energy contract, but for us, a subscription is something different.
Speaker 6: It is tied to the hardware, of course. but it is tied to other services that we offer as well.
Speaker 6: So for example, a subscription can say you have access to a certain feature in the software or not or a certain service that we offer or not, which is information that afterwards is used in other software systems.
Speaker 6: So what we are also interested in is how those things are managed because yeah, of course, for exampl e This information can be stored in the plan when we define it initially.
Speaker 6: But those things are exposed via the Commerce API.
Speaker 6: Is there a better way in which we can expose those features and attributes about the subscriptions that are sold or ready to a customer?
Speaker 6: So that they can be used by other systems.
Speaker 6: So I think I'm not sure if they have this aspect, but that is a little bit the aspect that we are interested in because yes, we have the hardware, but after the hardware is sold, there are other things that we consistently offer as part of the
Agent: Offering of a subscription to customers.
Agent: Yeah, I think from what I know, they also sell software and services because they sell apart from services like people, services in the sense, engineer, expertise or people that can support the final customer with the building of the solution and so on and so forth.
Agent: They also sell software. That is why I think this a customer, this experience is something quite near to what you need to do.
Agent: And the other reason why we selected this is also because we have a lot of information on this. But obviously, we are not to go.
Agent: In [DATE-4] of the aspects you are mentioning, like which [ORG-10] or which architecture solution was used to expose this on the different channels, which other elements they consider that we need.
Agent: To put you in contact with the team or with someone from the team that delivered this and built this for the customer because we personally have an eye level overview.
Agent: I know this is like the catalog in the sense they sell hardware and they sell services and they sell software. We're also part of this product in a subscription model.
Agent: And they built everything, you know, which says for us and with the energy described, they are not selling energy, okay, they are selling the hardware and services, okay, and software.
Agent: So if you think that, I think that the level of complexity and the kind of use case is not exactly your case but it's very near.
Speaker 6: So maybe what we're going to do is try to organize a session with our people that work on project.
Agent: The
Speaker 6: Is it this company that I shared the link to?
Speaker 6: Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 5: I'll take a look at what they're offering is on the website. Yeah. Okay. Good.
Speaker 5: But also, I think [PERSON-17] was a good idea to have this option, to have a call being organized with the team who delivered this project to this company, to learn more from them.
Speaker 5: [PERSON-13], I think we should consider it
Agent: When needed to learn more. I would be happy to join to listen.
Agent: Yeah, they also have another aspect that I, if I ever understood the last time with the conversation with the governor, you don't have to dislike the shade, the supply chain, in the sense they, they also take direct care of the, the provision, sorry, the, the bid hearing and change for the other, okay, so they do not build anything.
Agent: The companies not building me that's a hard work, but they have provided my partners. And so these companies mostly be to be okay.
Agent: So these companies sells large amount of other services and my subscription and so on in a long term scenario. So they say, okay, we do a contract with our customers for [DATE-25].
Agent: In the, in the during [DATE-28], we need to provide this amount of hardware, with this amount of services in this, with this schedule. Okay.
Agent: So it's, this part of complexity about supply chain may be, you don't have to manage, but it could be also, yeah, something that is in, or interest for you or not. But yeah, I agree.
Agent: So, [PERSON-17], if you give a look and you realize that this could apply or could be a meaningful use case, maybe.
Agent: It shouldn't be a problem to organize a direct [LAW-1] between you and our people, our experts, that work a lot more.
Agent: We only have left like [TIME-3] or so, I don't know if it's enough [PERSON-25] and him to see how the management I think is really too short. I would prefer.
Agent: That too we have, maybe we just need [TIME-4] or so we don't need long meaning to give you an idea of what our management is. [TIME-5] or two small, two few.
Speaker 5: I agree, I agree [PERSON-17]. I think we could organize a separation of,
Agent: On the supports as well.
Agent: Was that?
Agent: Yes, I can, I can take it offline with you. Just send me some options. And also who needs to be included in that session. And I can see the schedule for you with that right now. Yeah, no problem.
Speaker 6: Okay, is there anything else regarding the case and the customer that you prepared that you can share
Agent: Or was that mostly it [PERSON-10]?
Agent: Okay, well, we have a, I have a full deck with some more details, but I need to wait because it's been approved for an internal sharing.
Speaker 6: First for
Agent: Of course. Yeah, because unfortunately there are a lot of details, not a lot, but
Speaker 6: There are some details on the government. So the government needs to approve. Yeah, of course, we understand that.
Agent: So there's nothing else that you can share regarding that [DATE-17]. about this use case. I mean, I don't know, you have
Agent: Specific questions
Agent: In mind, because I know that the high level stories, they were starting from partially manual operations with a new company and that they have provided that are built in the artlet for them. They have customers.
Agent: And they sell to the customer, they are good producers by their partners, plus the services they provide internally. So they expertise.
Agent: The software services because they also sell like virtual servers, you know, and other elements to build electric distribution cabins and centrals and control the grid.
Agent: So this kind of hardware buildings are not just hardware, but obviously there are software services inside it.
Agent: It's not exactly a charger, it's a little bit more complex, but also if you think of a meter, Not the meter also can also be, I would say, augmented with some services.
Agent: So they combine together the supply chain of other with their services, they provide, and software and human services, and then they sell it through complex contracts to be to be companies [ORG-31], and distribution of adults.
Speaker 6: That are managed, like
Agent: In [GPE-4] and in the rest of [LOC-1] as you can see is like 17 different countries in the markets who... I don't know if you have specific questions, [PERSON-26], maybe I know something that I'm not mentioning, but
Speaker 6: This is the high level overview. Yeah, so I pasted the link of what is seems from their website, what seems to be a bit more aligned to what we are trying to do.
Speaker 6: And it's a combination of I guess they call it mirror as a service. So I imagine it includes the hardware and then also some software in regards to that.
Speaker 6: So I think if they are using sales force to manage that part, that is what would be interesting for us to learn from, because it is a bit more aligned. So that you need to check in
Agent: We understand, of course, with them on the next slide. I mean, I'm. They're not.
Agent: I know for sure that the part of the process that you see on this slide now, shall be made on the screen, so the full process of selling and fulfilling, this is done with sales, for sports, for this product, okay?
Agent: So the software, as I said, the software, they are included in the guide-all of management with sales, for [GPE-5] out. So that is, I can already say to you, yes, doing it wrong.
Speaker 6: They're
Agent: So maybe just to be conscious of time, we just have [TIME-6] left. I think [PERSON-1], what we can do is we can ask the internal team of the customer who implemented this.
Agent: If they are open for a call with you or reference call say share what they have implemented there.
Speaker 6: Or have
Agent: Specifically, on the last part with the metering as a service.
Speaker 6: You've mentioned with the
Agent: Let me just check that with the team and come back to you with that question when we can set up the meeting and how and who it is to be included in there.
Speaker 6: And
Agent: And then I think the second sectional item I have is that I will [PERSON-25] or [ORG-26] will mention the order of management piece so that we can schedule a [TIME-4] demo.
Agent: And I also just wanted to ask if everything is clear and it's Yeah, it's answered to your needs [PERSON-1] for the subscription. So when to you subscription management in [GPE-6].
Agent: What is currently available, what's available in order management and how everything <inaudible> up together. Maybe the last part is not clear, completely clear, but we can give a [TIME-7] demonstration around order.
Agent: Fulfillment facility, but I can understand that you are most interested in the first and maybe the last part so that's what we're doing.
Speaker 6: So let me know. Yeah, first of all, thank you for taking the time to meet with us and prepare for this and also walking us through all the information.
Speaker 6: I think it was useful and yeah, if we can have some additional details on how they worked with that part, it would be great.
Speaker 6: So maybe we can coordinate that as an next step and of course for [PERSON-9] to understand a little bit more about the order management part. Yeah, nothing else from my end.
Speaker 6: I don't know if anyone else from the [ORG-28] team wants to share other thoughts.
Speaker 5: Just it was very useful conversation. Thanks [PERSON-17] and Anuk for presentation. It increases quite a lot of understanding of salesforce products on my side.
Agent: Okay, thank you, not thank you to you and in general, I mean, for what it regards the detailed aspects of technical aspects of some elements and like, you know, my studio or typical or whatever.
Agent: Also, if you want to, if you have doubts about some of them, maybe you can also drop me an email and we can address them because obviously there are several aspects that we cannot address in a high level meeting like this.
Speaker 5: I'm a violin baller. Alright, alright, things in ill.
Agent: Thanks everyone.
Speaker 5: Have a great day.
Speaker 6: Have a great day. Thanks for the time. Bye bye.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information on the customer's specific concerns about the seller's product.

Question about customer examples where it's a combination of software and hardware: The customer seemed more engaged as they were interested in understanding how subscriptions are managed in the context of both software and hardware elements, which is relevant to their own business model.
2. Question about exposing features and attributes of subscriptions via the Commerce API: The customer showed interest in this topic as they wanted to know how to make this information available to other systems, which is important for their consistent offering of subscription-based services.
3. Question about organizing a session with the team who delivered the project to the Grisper ties company: The customer was keen on learning more from the team that delivered the project, indicating that they found the Grisper ties use case relevant and informative.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of explaining the features and capabilities of the product, but there were a few instances where they could have better articulated the value proposition of the company or product. Here are some opportunities:

1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep thanked the customer for being there, but they did not explicitly mention the purpose of the call or the value that the customer would gain from the call.
2. The sales rep mentioned the acquisition of Velocity and the integration of their software, but they did not clearly explain how this acquisition and integration would benefit the customer.
3. The sales rep mentioned the normalization of the solution, but they did not explain how this would make the customer's life easier or solve their pain points.
4. The sales rep mentioned the migration to the new studio, but they did not clearly explain the benefits of this migration or why the customer should care.
5. The sales rep mentioned the launch of the program for automatic upgrades, but they did not explain how this would save the customer time and effort.
6. The sales rep mentioned the roadmap and the investment pillars, but they did not clearly explain how these investments would benefit the customer.
7. The sales rep mentioned the new capabilities and applications provided by the company, but they did not clearly explain how these capabilities and applications would solve the customer's problems or meet their needs.

In general, the sales rep could have done a better job of connecting the features and capabilities of the product to the customer's pain points and needs. They could have also provided more concrete examples of how the product has helped similar customers in the past.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"Answer to this question is unclear.

Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear evidence of any concrete next steps being agreed upon by the sales rep and the customer. The sales rep does mention scheduling a follow-up call or demonstration, but it is not clear if this was explicitly agreed upon by the customer.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer: The customer did not explicitly express whether they feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They did mention that they are using some of the seller's products and services, and they are interested in learning more about certain features and aspects. They also asked for a reference call with the internal team of a customer who implemented a similar solution to understand their experience. However, they did not make a clear statement about whether the product meets their needs overall.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. The questions were:
- ""So, during [DATE-2], we have, every, every year we have three releases. And the idea behind this is as face-forces in general is doing with the [PRODUCT-1] is to provide new capabilities, okay?""
- ""So if there is already a product or a sub product that is providing a functionality, says for us it's trying to say, OK, this is the solution. We will not build other solutions for the same aspect.""
- ""So say it's also in the latest, I think mostly in [DATE-3] . is trying to simplify and normalize the solution.""
- ""So if you have any general question on, on energy ground as a vertical, feel free to, to ask, I mean, me and [PERSON-3] will be glad to answer.""
- ""So, during [DATE-2], we have, every, every year we have three releases. And the idea behind this is as face-forces in general is doing with the [PRODUCT-1] is to provide new capabilities, okay?""
- ""So there has been an effort to start producing some already built applications for some use cases, like for use cases for call center agents or use cases for the customer acquisition through the digital portals, the self-service portals and so on and so on.""
- ""So [ORG-2] has produced some of these applications already done that you can [PERSON-4], welcome. And we would see some of them more in [DATE-4].""
- ""Then there is, as you, as [PERSON-1] was asking about, I saw first also a verticalization of field service. This means that the [ORG-2] horizontal solution for [ORG-3] has been increased with some new licenses and capabilities.""
- ""And as an example, you know, the most ingredients for [ORG-4] users, the contractors that are not using directly the [PRODUCT-1] to access also the extended data model.""
- ""Go to the next slide . that is happening in the latest period of some prepared work cycles and mobile flows for typical field work from technical agents that are working on the field and so on.""
- ""So there is a set of licenses for [ORG-3] that is verticalized to allow you to provide those other energy discoveries like using an omni-script or accessing the model and so on.""
- ""Another thing that is quite relevant, probably you already are, if you are using the vertical you should know it, is that from [EVENT-1], we also have a launch into the program for automatic upgrades.""
- ""So this means that if you onboard on this program, you will not need to upgrade the managed package yourself for every version. But [ORG-2] will take care of upgrading the package.""
- ""Then what else?""
- ""There are some other things like we will see in the next slide, but essentially, you know, the roadmap is progressing.""
- ""So one of them is to to go to code, okay, and this is really taking a lot of efforts from our engineers because I can't repeat what is.""
- ""Another model, all the APIs for the CPU as an example have been moved to code. Most of them are already moved.""
- ""What else?""
- ""The only studio, only studio, so the set of the like on-microcript cards and so on and so forth, is there is now a standard Code version that is just using Code objects. And it still exists the package version.""
- ""But obviously to adapt to energy ground to work completely with the core solution of our new studio, there has been and is still not finished [DATE-6].""
- ""I think [DATE-7], would be the final [ORG-5] of the solution and the fence. Because some of the technical aspects behind the velocity assets like the car for [ORG-6] or other aspects, they are not easy.""
- ""In the sense, they use namespaces, they use a lot of... Code behind it, so to adapt it to work with the [PERSON-5] s in the standard, it took like one year You should be done now We are just waiting""
- ""For a go from product management to say, let's say to the customer to [ORG-7] e to [PERSON-6] in the standard.net to you .""
- ""When you"
video_19791_167_6qr3y000000odqJAAQ,"Agent: And [PERSON-1], nice to meet you. I think you are the only new face.
EndUser: Yeah, nice to meet you as well.
Agent: I'm [PERSON-2]. I'm the Marketing Cloud account executive that works with [ORG-1]. So [DATE-1] we're going to turn it over to [PERSON-3]. He'll be going through Marketing Cloud engagement.
Agent: And [PERSON-4], really from the conversations we had previously focusing in on some of those new areas within [PRODUCT-1] that you all currently can take advantage of.
Agent: The real outcome of this is to get your feedback on does the new functionality that would be available in this world. Help make your decision as to a direction to move in.
Agent: Is there value there from the pieces that [PERSON-3] shows above and beyond what you have [DATE-1]. So I will speak for [PERSON-3], but I'm sure [PERSON-3] will say the same.
Agent: If there are questions, comments, thoughts as we go through, we'd love to hear that and make sure that we are on the right path with what we show.
Agent: And again, please put your questions in the chat, raise your hand, just come off mute. This is meant to walk you through what's possible. So if that sounds good to everybody, I'll turn it over to [PERSON-3].
Agent: Thanks [PERSON-5] and good afternoon everybody there in court law [ORG-2] or wherever you join us from [DATE-1] my name is [PERSON-6].
Agent: I'm a lead solution engineer in the Marketing Cloud and I am going to show you the modern sales force [PRODUCT-1] [DATE-1].
Agent: So like [PERSON-7] said, as you have questions of questions come up, feel free to interrupt me, pop them in the chat.
Agent: We probably have [TIME-1] Content to go through, so there should be plenty of time for questions. So if you have questions, throw them out.
Agent: First things first, what do you actually get with Marketing Cloud?
Agent: So everything I show you [DATE-1] is out of the box. It comes with [PRODUCT-2] that you would upgrade to.
Agent: If I show you anything that is not included out of the box, I will call that out right up front.
Agent: We will talk about and you'll see mostly email [DATE-1], but I will also mention mobile and I'll also mention web, since all of those things are important to you all.
Agent: There may be a tiny mention of some digital advertising.
Agent: When we get to journeys and journey building, we have not included any kind of digital advertising capabilities out of the box with Marketing Cloud but certainly that's something you can grow into and add if you would like.
Agent: Thanks for watching ! Everything else you see [DATE-1] comes with the new and modern marketing cloud. So with that, we'll jump right in.
Agent: If you have not visited or you haven't seen an updated marketing cloud, this is what it's looked like for [DATE-2] now. I'll call your attention to the studios on the left.
Agent: These are, you can think of these as kind of your vertical communication channels, right?
Agent: We'll spend most of our time [DATE-1] in email, but [PRODUCT-1] can handle communication on every channel. That can include SMS and MMS text messaging, and also pushes out to current and future digital applications. We do that.
Agent: Just through an SDK So you can put that in any app that you would like It doesn't have to be specific to [ORG-3] You can't control digital advertising I'll make mention of that, but again, not include d with what we've scoped out of the box for you all [ORG-4] is something that we may not talk about in depth I can show you how we would build landing pages and the like And there are some really, really cool capabilities particularly this thing called interactive emai l that leverages the power of [ORG-4] even though you don't really see it And then personalization is a real-time interaction management tool, not anything we're going to talk about [DATE-1], but reall y, really cool and it's on right.
Agent: So if you think of those vertical communication channel s, let's just call them web text and email, you manage those kind of separately and individual ly a day and that causes problems with efficiency because you have to repeat efforts and you' re trying to knit those things togethe r. And it's really hard to understand how all those things work.
Agent: Plus, it's not the most efficient use of time for people who are responsible for building those things. So on the right, one of the most important parts of Marketing Cloud are the builders.
Agent: We'll spend a lot of time talking about [WORK_OF_ART-1] [DATE-1]. You will see Content builder. We will talk about contact builder. The builders work across the studios.
Agent: So that's why we can create behavior triggered Messaging based on what you do on a website, what you do in an email, what you do with a text message.
Agent: So the magic of all of this is really [WORK_OF_ART-1]. That's the thing that would really revolutionize the way that you all think about what you do. without down communication efforts . So we'll go through all that stuff.
Agent: As part of the show, you will see lots of [PERSON-8]. So Salesforce Einstein is our [PRODUCT-3] platform. I will call out the different parts of AI that you may be seeing and what we're leveraging.
Agent: We will talk a little bit about some predictive and generative [PRODUCT-3] that's just right out of the box with what we do. So with that, that's the lay of the land. That's what we're going to talk about [DATE-1].
Agent: Before we get to the fun stuff of how to build emails, deal with content, and interact with recipients in a different way, I am going to talk about data a little bit because all of this is kind of underpinned by the data that you have in recruit.
Agent: How do we get that data into [PRODUCT-1] in more efficient way?
Agent: And how might you even use data at some point that isn't in recruit?
Agent: You may have data that is useful, that doesn't necessarily need to go into the [PRODUCT-4] that you could still leverage for communication. So that's the overall plan [DATE-1].
Agent: Any objections, questions, burning thoughts or requests before we hop into it. All righty, then first up, and I'll do my best to show you where we're going [DATE-1].
Agent: The first place we are going to go is inside of contact builders. We can talk a little bit about that. So this is kind of the heart of everything that Marketing Cloud does.
Agent: This is both a visual and actual representation of our data architecture in the system.
Agent: It is a contact centric data model, meaning that we assign a unique identifier to one person, so that whether there is data about you coming from multiple places, like recruit, or from other systems, we can rationalize who you are.
Agent: This contact centric hub is spoke data model is really central to what we do And this is the bulk of the work and effor t that Off-Print technology that you spoke with last wee k by implementation, they will help you set up these connection s because there are lots of ways to do thi s through the new and future APIs that [ORG-5] releases through Marketing Cloud APIs But [DATE-1], you can leverage things like automated SFTP dropoff s to do those integrations There are lots of integration methods available The thing that I want you to understand her e is that any piece of data that [ORG-1] ha s, you can connect to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud data mode l. Yes, the majority of that data tod ay lives and recruit.
Agent: But if that changes in the future, if there are new efforts in the future, or if you just want to expand what you're doing, because there's a lot of efficiency that we'll find in [PRODUCT-1] now, you can do that pretty easily, and you can spin up these hubs and spokes as needed.
Agent: So if in the future, there's a different [ORG-6] or a different financial aid system, or just some really important VIP recruiting spreadsheet that you get from somewhere that needs to be related into the system so you can use it.
Agent: There is a way to do that. That's what the data designer, what [PRODUCT-1] data is about. We'll use the term the way [PRODUCT-1] rationalizes data is with data extensions.
Agent: Data extensions are just a data table inside of the marketing cloud. So each one of these data connections can have multiple data extensions, any data that you add to the marketing cloud.
Agent: We'll relate back to a contact ID to a subscriber key so that we know that [PERSON-4] at [ORG-7] and [PERSON-4] at [ORG-8] are the same person.
Agent: And you can even start to do things like understand multiple mobile addresses and that stuff.
Agent: So questions about data or any of that stuff with the understanding that a huge portion of the work for data design and making this happen is what [PERSON-9] from [ORG-9] discussed with you [DATE-3].
Agent: So once we have the data, we can do fun things with it.
Agent: Any questions about this?
Agent: And like I said, we can be as technical here as anybody wants to be. But I want to make sure you understand where all of the magic tidbits come from that you're that we're about to use. All right.
Agent: Hub and spoke data model, very important. If you have the data, you can connect it to that contact hub and use it to do fun stuff.
Agent: So one of the first things that you might want to do is some segmentation or suppression. Here I am inside of email studio, excuse me, email studio and I am creating a data filter.
Agent: So data filters exist all over the Marketing Cloud and this is how you as a communications user, as an admissions user, are going to start manipulating data.
Agent: Here I am looking for a segment, so I want to create a segment where somebody has an incomplete application, so maybe they've started and they haven't completed, and their first time freshmen.
Agent: So this data is available to me and all of these data fields that you see here are available to me because they were connected through the hub and spoke model.
Agent: When that data is connected to the hub, you can do the following things. So maybe you want to create a special campaign that's focusing only on out-of-state students.
Agent: So we wanna look for a state not equal to [GPE-1] and we can do as many nested and ors as we want here.
Agent: So if we wanted this to be and this to be or, or if you wanna create really interesting program specific, defined specific degree programs, degree tracks, If you're looking for only women from a certain zip code that you want to target with some sort of outreach, you can do that.
Agent: The idea is that any piece of data that you have, you can define drag and drop.
Agent: You don't need any kind of... Any kind of special data skills, you don't need any kind of understanding of SQL to start creating the sort of segment that you want.
Agent: Behind the scenes, what this is doing is actually writing a SQL statement that we query the data with. You don't need to know anything about that.
Agent: This opens up a new world of being able to manipulate your data, right?
Agent: You don't have to ask someone who understands your database, you don't have to ask someone to combine data for you. Whoever is creating a [PRODUCT-5] target, creating a list, whatever that is, you can do it on your own.
Agent: So this, I hope this sounds more fun than it looks because this is kind of the least <inaudible> thing in terms of what it looks like in marketing cloud, but it's probably the most powerful because this opens up literally any piece of data with roles and permissions to anyone who needs to use it in their context.
Agent: So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5].
Agent: Questions about that?
Agent: The data filters will show up everywhere. We'll see them again in [PRODUCT-5] targeting.
Agent: You can save these and reuse them, which means someone, maybe someone in admissions is responsible for creating all the data filters, and then someone who's responsible for creating [PRODUCT-5] only applies the data filters.
Agent: So all of that's a possibility, but this is how you interact with your data in marketing club. So once we have a... question. Sorry. This might be maybe more of an offline question for [PERSON-10] afterwards.
EndUser: But like as and when our data goes in, I'm curious how the fields will come through from the different entities, like opportunity person, you know, the application entity, like all those things, how they'll show up on that side, or maybe [PERSON-3], you know, if you brought over recruit users?
Agent: So I can give my answer for I've seen other users do this. Obviously the world's your oyster and you guys will set it up however you would like.
Agent: Inside of the connections that you make to different source systems, you'll actually do basically create a crosswalk so that you can say this is opportunity data and it maps to this field.
Agent: This is lead data and it maps to this field. That sort of granularity for all of the fields that you want to map is up to you in the data creation process.
Agent: I don't know how that works for you all today, but again, that is part of the work so that whatever data structures that you have and recruit that you may want to maintain in marketing cloud, you'd simply set up the model to work that way.
Agent: The field in [PRODUCT-1] knows that it's equivalent to this field. in your source system like recruit. We have that set up already. We have that set up already.
Agent: Is that going to be different?
Agent: Doesn't have to be. No. So I think the difference would be is.
Agent: Is there data that you can't get at now that you want to leverage with [PRODUCT-1] or for future development purposes when ethos is a reality for you all?
Agent: Are there things that you maybe want to update on a different cadence?
Agent: So things that come in maybe more frequently than the daily, you know, [DATE-6] drop off kind of pulls. You wouldn't have to change any of that. You could replicate it.
Agent: I would encourage you to think about not only replicating because there is a lot of new capability here, but certainly you can do that to start as a pretty low lift.
EndUser: Yeah, I feel like, again, we could do this offline, but the participant data is not always, or participant polls are not always really easy to get all the data we need mat correctly, but we can move on. Yeah.
Agent: Just for clarity, in the beginning, your hub and spoke may just have one spoke, right?
Agent: It's just contact data just coming from one data feed and recruit. The point here.
Agent: Is that you can grow that data ecosystem, right?
Agent: It doesn't always have to be just a single connection.
Agent: There may be things that you want to pull directly from forms, directly from websites, maybe directly from things like [ORG-10]. We'll talk about that in a bit.
Agent: The only thing back to that hub and spoke model, just to call out, because I think we've mentioned it, is the business unit architecture option would be new to what they would have available.
Agent: I don't know how much it applies in this initial part of a consideration, but no one that we're representing undergrad and grad, and I know there's been about how financial aid fits into some communication models that exist.
Agent: Can you just give like the 33nd of what this could potentially mean?
Agent: Yeah, so business units in the Marketing Cloud are essentially shared infrastructure, right?
Agent: I'm in the prestigious [ORG-9]. You can have as many layers of business units as you would like.
Agent: For example, I've created one for our online, our online college where, subunits all report up to the same unit, meaning that [ORG-1] can know everything that sent to everyone, but maybe in enrollment, I only have access to the data and [PRODUCT-5] that I need to do what I do.
Agent: So in that way, if there ever needs to be any kind of bifurcation in data or responsibilities for who creates what and shares what, that capability exists, and then users within those units and administrators of the top unit decide who gets to see what.
Agent: So.
Agent: That is a great capability to have if there's ever a need for people to share data at a high level, but also to protect certain data or content, or if branding's really different, right?
Agent: The way that you talk about graduate degrees may be really different than the way that you talk about undergraduate degrees, so we create [PRODUCT-5] in a different place. But that possibility exists. All right.
Agent: That's all of the unfun data related stuff. Data comes into marketing cloud, let's do something with it. So I am inside email studio here and I am starting just with a template.
Agent: So I am very fond of saying that templates and dynamic [PRODUCT-5] will set you free. I've created just from stolen items on your website, created a template here for you.
Agent: I'll point out that we offer responsive design templates out of the box so you can design in a mobile emulator view. I'm showing you in desktop here just because it fits on my screen a little better.
Agent: And as a template creator, you can choose who can change things with the template. So perhaps you are very, very sensitive to making sure that exactly the right size color lines, low those, that's what a stuff gets enforced.
Agent: An administrator can block areas of the template so that no one will ever be able to change things like the header and footer, right?
Agent: So that a [PRODUCT-5] creator only has to focus on content. You will only have access to do things that have those roles and permissions in the system. Everything that happens in [PRODUCT-5] is drag and drop.
Agent: So I will show you what I mean by that, but it's basically if you want an image, you are going to drag and drop and define that image.
Agent: I started building some Content for you, just some basic stuff that again, I borrowed from your website so we can talk about how this works. You can also do this with layouts.
Agent: So I've chosen basically a hero image, some text and a call to action button. You don't have to know anything about HTML. It'll make this stuff work.
Agent: You choose and drag and drop your layouts to decide what you want.
Agent: If now we're in the future, you or web designers want to leverage things that are already built in HTML, everything in [PRODUCT-1] will render and display HTML, CSS and [GPE-2]. Yes, it's [PERSON-9], [PERSON-1], sorry.
EndUser: I was just going to say, we kind of already know how to do this. We do this already. So this is kind of like stuff that is new to us.
EndUser: I don't know if maybe you want to like try kind of something else because I mean, [PERSON-9], if you're okay with that. I mean, I'm already used to doing it like this already. I know you are too. Okay.
EndUser: So.
Agent: Sure. Um, you guys do dynamic Content [DATE-1]. So you're familiar with dynamic content, setting filters, um, that sort of stuff. Yes. This looks familiar to you. Perfect. So all of that stuff already exists.
Agent: The things that you don't do [DATE-1] may be some things like advanced [PRODUCT-5] design. So stuff like interactive email.
Agent: So interactive email is essentially a way to embed a web form into email so that you lower the friction required to get information from someone and just make it a lot easier to collect.
Agent: So here's what that would look like. So by dragging an interactive form block into the email and a built one for you here, you can do stuff like this.
Agent: Maybe you just want to collect some preference information as part of an email send, right?
Agent: So I need to know, hey, what might help you decide to enroll?
Agent: How seriously are you thinking about this?
Agent: Is there other stuff that you want to know?
Agent: All of this is just captured as a data extension and [PRODUCT-1] that can further your automation.
Agent: So knowing this information could help you focus on, hey look, we want the kind of warm, but I'm not sure I'm coming yet. And the people who say, yeah, you're definitely my number one choice.
Agent: I'm going to segment you differently. This costs very little effort to set up and you can see huge increases in engagement of the cause of it.
Agent: We've had customers who have seen not [PERCENT-1] but 10x greater engagement with email by doing things like this. The an interesting point about this is you can also pass hidden fields.
Agent: So you could make this a progressive form. So if you wanted new fields to show up, you don't want to show someone five different things, they have to answer every time.
Agent: Maybe in every outreach, you're updating one or two components to get more information. Yep, go ahead.
EndUser: So with this too, if we do have like it be so interactive where they're putting in like different types of information, like even like first name, last name or whatever, even though we already have that.
Agent: Can that actually just go back and connect into recruit them, you think?
Agent: Is that a possibility?
Agent: We can send back into an opportunity record and all that. It can. So that exists. I do want to say that Marketing Cloud doesn't magically make that happen.
Agent: It's dependent upon your integration method, right?
Agent: So absolutely, that's a possibility. The data can be stored in Marketing Cloud for a point, and then maybe once a week or [DATE-7], you do that poll now.
Agent: The possibility exists, certainly on [PRODUCT-1] side for this to be real-time.
Agent: I know there's discussion about what that would look like for you long-term in [ORG-1] as you guys adopt more of a recruit and ethos API philosophy versus those manual drop-offs. But yeah, absolutely.
Agent: The possibility exists for any data collected [PRODUCT-1] to be sent back to another system.
Agent: How you get that data from [PRODUCT-1] is kind of incumbent upon your setup and upon the system that you would send it to.
EndUser: Yeah, we could probably do the same thing with the SFTP, right?
EndUser: Or just put it into a folder and then it gets, oh, okay. So there we could do that.
EndUser: But with this form too, like how interactive can we get?
EndUser: Can we do like drop down menus to between like
Agent: Yeah, so let's I've got a few different. Let me get rid of this guy here. I've got a few different types of Content here. So let me hop into a preview and show you what it looks like.
Agent: So when I go to preview and test this particular form, this is what the experience would look like. I'll do it in mobile since pretty much everybody's gonna be doing a mobile. This is a multi-select.
Agent: So you know what, I'm having trouble with FAFSA and I wanna see what the campus looks like. I'm warm, but I don't know. This is pre-response. This is checkbox. So that's kind of what the experience looks like.
Agent: We'll go back. I'll show you another one that I've seen a lot of customers use very successfully. Since you all do have a student ambassador program, you could set up a way to do interactive ask a student.
Agent: So this one would have drop-downs. When you create those, [PERSON-1], it's pretty easy. These are the options you have for text, select, radio, checkbox, images, star ratings, that kind of stuff.
Agent: So that's all very much kind of click and configure. And let me show you what that looks like so far as the experience. But yes, you can do drop downs. That's my long way of saying.
Agent: Yeah, you can drop downs multi-select.
EndUser: [PERSON-9], you might have already been doing this.
EndUser: I was just thinking for us to, we ever send out to like a spec list, you know, for people and they want to take what major they're in, we can change that drop down to math, which then recruits.
EndUser: They're going to have to go to another website. It is right there on the email and send it in. You probably already are doing that, but I was just.
EndUser: Yeah, no, we actually haven't been doing that. And we've been talking about using suspects, but we aren't currently, but all good things.
EndUser: I could think of 10 ways to use this right off the top. We do.
EndUser: Ok. And that's exactly the point, right?
Agent: You can collect this on a web form and I'm not saying that this should replace any kind of web form strategy that you have.
Agent: What this can do is supplement that communication in a very real way, right?
Agent: The reason that we have customers see that big increase in engagement is it costs me a lot less clicks to do this from an email.
Agent: I'm already looking at them, open it up in the browser and maybe having to scroll. You know, those little things that reduce friction matter.
Agent: So that's, you know, this starts to answer some of what I believe [PERSON-9] was talking about. with like capturing demonstrated interest throughout the process. Right.
Agent: Is that what we were thinking of here too for interactive email?
Agent: I
Agent: Think so. It could. No, that question is not for me.
Agent: But yeah, the idea is In every send, if you wanted, you can create a way for that recipient on the other end to give you information, right?
Agent: A direct way to offer up zero-party information that you can use for further segmentation suppression, whatever you would like.
Agent: All right, a couple of things that I do want to show you that are kind of new to marketing clients [DATE-1]. Maybe right now, you wouldn't know how to start thinking about all of these new segments you create.
Agent: So using something like interactive email, some of you have a lot more data, so you can do a lot more refined targeting. We do offer some generative [PRODUCT-3] out of the box.
Agent: So here I'll show you what that looks like in terms of subject lines. So what we're doing here, this is leveraging a secure [WORK_OF_ART-2].
Agent: So all of the trust and security of the [ORG-3] comes here. Now [PERSON-14]...
Agent: I'm just going to do what I would do with chat [ORG-9], right?
Agent: So the key message is I want you to apply [DATE-1]. and we want you here, whatever it is that you want in that subject line.
Agent: I've created a brand personality where I gave it some parameters and here's the prompt that you should use.
Agent: You have to click the box that says you understand robots particularly over the world if you don't use this with correct ethics and business protocol and it'll create some draft subject lines for you.
Agent: So look, maybe these aren't perfect. Yeah, that one looks okay, that one doesn't. What is awesome about this is you start training . [ORG-1] starts training its own [WORK_OF_ART-3] inside of marketing cloud.
Agent: So the more you use it, the smarter it gets, the more effective it becomes.
Agent: So this is not going to replace what a marketer does, but it probably changes the way you think about spending your time, right?
Agent: You can pick out a few subject lines that, you know, look good so you can start thinking about other things.
Agent: The exact same thing exists When you are creating text and body copy, if you want to take it to that degree, you'll be able to create even generative body copy if that's something that you want to do.
Agent: And again, since you can create brand personalities that you control and prompt, you can try and control what the output of that generative [PRODUCT-3] is so that it sounds like the same kind of brand identity and voice you have when your marketing is writing.
Agent: So, just another way to start expanding out and using. using some of the [PRODUCT-3] availability. One last thing, you all do any A, B testing with what you're doing [DATE-1] in email.
Agent: So there are a couple of ways to think about A, B testing. You can do it right inside.
Agent: So you'll see this [PRODUCT-5] block, an A, B test Content block, where you literally just define A, define B, and see who wins.
Agent: I built one for you just to give you an idea of what it would look like. If you do it one block at a time, you are literally going to do it one block at a time.
Agent: Is it the carrying shark or the disruptor shark that gets more clicks?
Agent: A really easy thing to do. This doesn't have to be images. It can be any combination of things. Code snippets, images, buttons, any of those sorts of things you could do as an AV test.
Agent: If you are looking to do multivariate A-B testing, that's what this entire A-B testing menu is about so that you can change what the from name is, what the subject line is, everything in the body.
Agent: So if you're looking to do multivariate testing, that's built in. If you just want to do quick head to heads and see what happens, that's what the A-B testing Content box is about. All right.
Agent: I know you guys have this today, but just so we don't lose it.
Agent: Anytime you see the silhouette inside of marketing cloud, this guy, so whether it's that's in subject lines, templates, anywhere else, any piece of data that you have, again, connected through that hub and spoke data model you do, you can use to do your replace stream kind of stuff.
Agent: So that's a quick run through of content, questions about that. Anything that you want to do, that you didn't see, anything you're curious about.
EndUser: Well, actually I got one funny question for you.
EndUser: So with that little guy that you just showed us, what'd you call him again?
EndUser: Oh, so the care.
Agent: No, yeah, the little degree, pick out all the data source, like the silhouette for a person. Yeah, just so this is just our replace string menu. Yep.
EndUser: Yeah. So that silhouette, let me ask you a question.
EndUser: How do you delete one of those off of that as an option?
EndUser: Like say that you go in there and you choose a data source. And yep, a data extension or data source and you put it in there and you want to get rid of it.
EndUser: How do you get rid of it?
EndUser: Because I went through you guys as customer service after I put one on there and I could not get rid of it for the life of me.
EndUser: I found a way to do it by deleting the old data source, but it was like a big pain and not even customer service could help me.
Agent: So if I do like a first name, I just want to do a first name personalization in the subject line.
Agent: You're asking how would I get rid of this?
Agent: No, as an option out of the silhouette. Oh, so you can't even see it. Yeah. Got it. So that is if you do not restrict a data extension that comes in.
Agent: So if you've got everything from recruit, that's available to everyone, then you would be able to pick everyone. What they're pick every data field.
Agent: What we see most customers do, especially if they're going to be occasional users that are building content, is use something called a filtered data extension, where you're taking just some of those components, right?
Agent: So maybe instead of every single field in the world, we just want there to be like 10 so that a [PRODUCT-5] builder can do some personalization without, you know, blowing up the world. So you could absolutely restrict that.
Agent: The short answer would be [PERSON-1] that you are doing that as a separate data extension or as a filtered view of an existing data extension .
Agent: And then you would restrict by user, you would restrict by user role who has access to what.
Agent: But yeah, I think they're, I'm sorry, that experience happened to you, but someone should have been able to express press two Hey, look, if you delete it from the data extension, it's gone from the data extension forever.
Agent: So why not just create a data extension that has those things that you want?
Agent: Yeah, I figured it out. I just wanted to see what you had in terms of suggestions. Yeah. Yeah. So templates, dynamic content, [ORG-9] testing, interactive email, which I can't overstate the importance of that.
Agent: It's all about making things a little bit easier for folks. Any kind of Content you want to create, we make it pretty easy. And again, copy and paste that stuff from HTML into this.
Agent: You can do it either or as well. You don't have to choose all Content blocks or all HTML. You can go back and forth between those things.
Agent: Anything else about Content before we move on?
Agent: So the whole point of this is to do this. This is the fun part. This is [WORK_OF_ART-1]. This is [WORK_OF_ART-1].
Agent: And this is the point of [PRODUCT-1] so that we can take any piece of data and automate Messaging on any channel. I'm just doing this as a basic email send right now.
Agent: So right now, if you're in my data extension and you have an email address, I'm gonna send you this email.
Agent: So maybe this is coming from an [ORG-14] form, right?
Agent: Anybody who clicks on the [ORG-14], this is the journey that you go on. where I'm going to send you some communication, I'm going to control the flow of that communication, maybe I send you some follow-up, and that's it.
Agent: So this is a short journey. So maybe to try and get some more engagement, you decide to use some tools in Marketing Cloud like predictive AI.
Agent: So predictive send time optimization looks at all the clicks and data that we have about you.
Agent: And based on the time period that you define, it's going to put it at the top of your inbox at the time that you're most likely to read it.
Agent: So I know [PERSON-7]'s up at [TIME-2] on [DATE-8], so that's when I'm going to send it to her in [DATE-9]. I know that [PERSON-17] reads things late on [DATE-10].
Agent: That's when I put it in her inbox. The idea being that it's the small things that you can do . to try and increase the likelihood that people are going to engage with your message.
Agent: Small thing, really easy to do, and it costs you a couple of clicks to set it up.
Agent: If you decide you're one two design something completely different, there is version control in [WORK_OF_ART-1], so you can always roll back to an earlier version if you don't like what you're working on.
Agent: But here I built more of a multi-channel journey where I'm going to look at behavior.
Agent: So in addition to sending that email, after [DATE-9], I want to know, did you click?
Agent: Did you actually click on the call to action?
Agent: Did you click on the Completely Enrollment button?
Agent: If you did, maybe I want to look for something else. I want to look for a data flag and recruit that says... Thanks for watching .
Agent: Application Complete, Deposit Paid, whatever that is, and based on the individual information about whether I clicked or not it chooses the path that I go down. If I did click Great, then I take the follow through steps. Great.
Agent: If I did click, but for some reason I didn't take that next step, clearly I'm someone who will engage with email, so let's send another email.
Agent: If I never clicked in the first place, maybe email is not it for me. I'm not paying attention to emails that come from you.
Agent: And instead, we're going to drop in a text message and send you that call to action via text. Then we can run the same logic.
Agent: Did you do the thing that we wanted you to do?
Agent: If so, great. We're just going to join you Backup to the top journey here and finish your enrollment. If not, that's when you can decide to do other things.
Agent: One of those things could be a very targeted paid digital ad audience. So you're going to include that individual in a very tight, low volume target ad buy to try and get them to convert.
Agent: Maybe if that doesn't work, maybe then and only then do we want to pay for postage and glossy mailers to go out to someone.
Agent: So based on whether you engage or not, what actions you take or not, you can control with automation and journey builder what happens next.
Agent: So this is the big idea and all of us as All of us as savvy digital consumers, we do this all the time, right?
Agent: [EVENT-1] was [DATE-9]. If you've ever gone to a website, put a thing in your cart and then intentionally not checked out because you know you're going to get a coupon in [DATE-9].
Agent: You know you're going to get a text rebate offer or that thing starts following you around on [ORG-17], [ORG-22], whatever. This is the kind of tool that controls that experience.
Agent: The idea is to knit together your communication channels, knit together all those pieces of data you have, honor the response.
Agent: That you get from people to drive the next step, all without someone having to go in pull a list, put it in somewhere else, and do that activation .
Agent: The kind of efficiency that you get from this process is hard. It's hard to comprehend when you're in a world now where what you do is recruit communication plans.
Agent: So the idea here is all the stuff that you would do or want to do more than what a communication plan would handle. This is the answer for how you would do that.
Agent: So we can talk more about all the different things available in [FAC-1] building but questions about this general idea.
EndUser: So I love this. This is the kind of stuff that I geek out over.
EndUser: How would this information look like coming back into recruit?
EndUser: Like... I'm trying to envision what it would look like because I can see the person record and the activities and the emails that they're receiving, although for us, texts aren't on there and things like that.
EndUser: But I'm just curious how this would feedback into recruit.
Agent: Yep. So again, I can tell you what the possibilities are from the Marketing Cloud side, then it would be up to you as to decisions what you feedback into recruit.
Agent: All of the things that I will call engagement data. So clicks, form fills, that sort of stuff. That's all information that's just part of a contact record, part of that contact ID and marketing cloud.
Agent: If there are parts of that you want to send back to their recruit record, great.
Agent: One of the most common things that we see is customers creating, by the way, what happens behind the scenes here?
Agent: You're just going to create, there's just going to, there is a data table that is created automatically in marketing cloud. so that you can do something with it down the road.
Agent: One of those things that you may want to do and what we see customers do most often in recruiting is create like [DATE-14] or [DATE-17] look back so that someone on a contact record can see, these are all the times that [PERSON-22] clicked in [DATE-22].
Agent: We may not want to see a full text and full message of everything ever sent.
Agent: You could do that, you know, it's debatable, the value of that, but any piece of data that [PRODUCT-1] collects, is there so that it can be sent to other places.
Agent: Again, I don't want to represent that is an automatic magic button that just happens. But to answer your question, [PERSON-4], each of these steps is just creating a data table.
Agent: You could direct that data table potentially to any place or any field dependent upon that receiving system. One of the most common things that we see recruit customers do right out of the box is these exits to journeys.
Agent: So let's say you got somebody who does all the things that you want them to do, the exit to a journey could be the beginning of another journey, right?
Agent: So everybody that gets through this gauntlet, that is simply creating a data extension, a list of people that were then going to put on our enrollment nurturing journey or start your advising journey, right?
Agent: So at the most basic level, every one of these steps is simply creating a data table. You can choose to send that data anywhere you would like or leverage it in other places in [PERSON-9].
Agent: Certainly one of the things we do in [ORG-3] [PRODUCT-4] is send that stuff back to contact records and leads and that sort of thing.
Agent: You would need to make sure that is possible and doable with your setup in recruit. Things like creating a task for recruiter in recruit. Short of that, you can also do things like send an email notification.
Agent: We see customers as a work around before you get that real-time integration with recruit. I'm doing things like that to send a recruiter in the morning Hey, here were your most active people [DATE-9].
Agent: These might be the ones that you want to reach out to [DATE-1].
EndUser: Do you have other institutions or another, maybe, user that is a recruit, a [NORP-1] user that is currently using [WORK_OF_ART-1], anyone that might be interested in chatting with us, that could show us real time, kind of how they do it?
Agent: I know those customers exist, but because [ORG-3] doesn't build that, you will need to work with off-prem to talk with those folks or other partners who have done it since we're not doing that work unless you know of someone [PERSON-7].
Agent: But generally, we refer folks to the partners who build that integration. Yeah, I was going to say [PERSON-9], we can, I know [PERSON-9] is going to do the demo, but he's in flight.
Agent: I'll connect with him and see who he can recommend that they've worked on to talk with you all that works. That'd be great. Thank you.
Agent: So the short story here is any way you want to control the flow of communications or information. You do it with flow control.
Agent: If you want to wait based on whether someone has clicked, based on some specific date, you know, this whole when I click when I engage, it's great for people who engage, but there are deadlines and admissions.
Agent: So maybe you wait until a specific date and it's [DATE-21] before an enrollment deadline so the push goes to everyone. There are ways to control this.
Agent: One other thing that I'll point out here is that [PERSON-8] exists in lots of ways out of the box in [PRODUCT-1]. One of the most useful ones can be with an Einstein engagement scoring split.
Agent: [PERSON-8] engagement scoring is a predictive [PRODUCT-3] score, 0 to 90.
Agent: How likely are you to click?
Agent: How likely are you to convert?
Agent: So you could do things like start segmenting folks based on what their engagement score is. So again, all of this is set up behind the scenes.
Agent: People who are more likely, most likely to click, we're going to send different [PRODUCT-5] to those people.
Agent: And of course, we want to do that based on click likelihood, not open likelihood, and let [PERSON-8] create those segments for you. So you can use [PRODUCT-3] to start getting more segment awareness than potentially you have [DATE-1].
Agent: Or then you have people to do the analysis for. That's the idea of how you could use predictive analysis. In addition to [PERSON-21] and Engagement Scoring, we also do a frequency score.
Agent: So this, I call this the Goldilocks score, right?
Agent: So based on somebody's engagement pattern, are they getting too much, not enough, or is it just right?
Agent: And you can start to split people out using [PRODUCT-3] in that way. The idea here is that it's there. It costs a couple of clicks to put it in and see how it works. most of our customers .
Agent: Put [ORG-9] in front of every send because it isn't no way harmful and can, you know, you can see incremental upticks and engagement because of that.
Agent: So that's journey building. I want to talk a little bit about reporting before we leave journey questions.
Agent: The only thing that I'd dinnell and [PERSON-25], when specifically, you know, the two, between three of us, we've talked a lot about like the email volume and quantity and how like emails are just going on.
Agent: Everybody, I think like we've talked about a journey builder and knowing that someone has taken an action and not sending them necessarily that an email that they don't need, right?
Agent: I think should help. start to cut down some of the extra volume that's perhaps happening because of the way sending is happening [DATE-1].
Agent: So just curious to have questions about that and just wanted to point that out because I know that a hot topic and I think that [WORK_OF_ART-1] will help to make sure those people are out automatically.
Agent: They're getting the next message they need as they need it. That sort of thing.
EndUser: I agree. I'm a little too.
Agent: So, I mean, this is just my point of view.
Agent: If people aren't engaging with your email and they've got a long history of not engaging with your email, pounding them over the face with more email may not be the best approach.
Agent: Sure, you may get someone who randomly clicks after [DATE-25] when they have it after all that time. But there's potentially a lot less sending that can be cut out to people who aren't engaging with it.
Agent: Having the ability to analyze that engagement matters. You can do that with journeyability. You can do that with some reports. So let's talk about reporting real quickly.
Agent: You may already be familiar with this level of sin tracking inside of marketing cloud. This is just single sin tracking. How many clicks, how many bounces, hard or soft, that kind of stuff.
Agent: You want to get kind of your click activity, heat map, which links, which areas where people using, that something exists in the Marketing Cloud here as well.
Agent: I do want to show you a tool that I'm not sure you're using [DATE-1] out of the box called intelligence reports. So, intelligence reports in the Marketing Cloud are pre-configured dashboards leveraging our broader [PRODUCT-1] intelligence platform.
Agent: And again, this is out of the box to help you do quick analysis of big data.
Agent: So, if you want to look for certain sending dates, certain campaigns, and analyze what engagement looked like, what does the pattern look like daily for all of these metrics.
Agent: If I want to look at only one or two things, that is a really easy thing to manipulate. These dashboards are real time. Parts and pieces of these dashboards can be scheduled.
Agent: So the sharing guy right here can be great. You could set up a scheduled report to go out every [DATE-22] at 4.634038513414288 to deans or whomever that may want to know what's happening.
Agent: This can save you a lot of time and keep people up to date with what's going on. They don't have to log in the Marketing Cloud to see it.
Agent: You can just have it sent as a PDF or an image sent out via email. So, parts or pieces of a dashboard are really easy to automate in that way.
Agent: Lots of cool things you can do around understanding what your deliverability looks like.
Agent: Here, I'm just going to look at unsubscribe rates to find out, do I have problems with certain email domains?
Agent: Are there [DATE-25] or sending patterns where I can do things to, you know, reduce what my undeliverables look like?
Agent: So ways to manage that sort of deliverability hygiene. And then if you want to start doing some broad audience analysis, we make that really easy too.
Agent: So for whatever reason, this registration incomplete audience, our click rate is way higher.
Agent: Why is that?
Agent: Or our unsubscribes or hire for this audience?
Agent: It's a way to start looking at big data in a way that you can make some decisions about all of the data behind all of these dashboards you can pivot on.
Agent: So if you want to get that in the pivot and start drilling down, you absolutely can do it. One of the other things that we include with intelligence reports is cross channel apps.
Agent: So this would be a paid edition if you want it. It is not a wildly expensive thing, but there are four cross-channel apps, including one that works with [ORG-10].
Agent: I'll show you what that looks like for email-to-web conversion. And all of this works simply through single sign-on to your [ORG-21] account. So I saw the [ORG-21] tracking links you all have updated to GA4 for web tracking.
Agent: What you do here is basically single sign-on to that. GA4 account, it's going to pull in all of your [ORG-21] web tags and properties, mix that with your [PRODUCT-1] data so you can see things like this funnel.
Agent: Based on emails sent, how many visits did that get us?
Agent: How many applications did that get us?
Agent: If you want to do things like traffic analysis from web and email, you can start to see what that looks like and start drilling into some insights.
Agent: If you want to see what performance looks like between email and web. The idea here.
Agent: Here is we, [ORG-3] know that pretty much the entire world uses [ORG-10] So we're offering a pretty easy way to start [PERSON-22] those two things, to do some analysis that you may no t have time or bandwidth to do [DATE-1] .
Agent: Right?
Agent: So if we want to look at what is our, you know, what is our very best visitor bounce rate and what is that telling us about which days that happened, which campaigns are producing that?
Agent: It's a pre-configured dashboard. You don't have to have a data analyst or someone who suddenly has [TIME-3] in a day to go and figure this stuff out. So short answer with intelligence and reporting.
Agent: Is that any kind of reporting you want to do is available in the marketing cloud, whether that's individual, kind of, send-level reports, subscriber-level reporting, or this kind of broader analysis of what's going on across all of your sending that is interactive and most importantly can be scheduled and shared across the department across the university.
Agent: Questions about reporting?
Agent: Or any other kinds of reporting that I think to Recover the ones that I take notes on, we had taken notes on from our last conversation, but any other metrics that you're just curious about?
EndUser: I'm not thinking metrics, but I'm thinking about you know, calendaring and sending that out. I think about an email that [PERSON-4] sends every [DATE-25] of like, here's what's upcoming for our, like, here's the communications that are going out.
EndUser: Now that may be different now if we incorporate your new builder because those, some of those triggered communications, but some of those date specific communications that we want our team to know and be aware of as their students get in.
EndUser: So, can that be automatically sent for [PERSON-4]'s sake?
Agent: There is a communications calendar inside the marketing cloud.
Agent: It may not do all of the things you want it to do, but certainly you can create so that anybody inside of the business unit could see that, you know, we have a campaign launching [DATE-1].
Agent: These are [DATE-4] they are going to be events and messages. That is absolutely possible to do. You could set up some automation so that those things get added to the calendar.
Agent: If you don't have something like this today, and by the way, the way that I see most modern admissions departments who aren't making broad use of marketing cloud, the way that I see most of them doing it [DATE-1], it's kind of whiteboards and sticky notes.
Agent: So if you're doing it that way, you're not the only people who do it that way, but there is a way to create it digitally and share.
Agent: A couple of things that don't happen here, this calendar doesn't export to anywhere.
EndUser: So if you want to use this calendar, you need to be in Marketing Cloud and be able to see it. But there is a calendar kind of out of the box how you use it is up to you.
EndUser: So there is a way for the left hand and the right hand to know what's going on, [PERSON-25]. But date specific campaigns don't auto-populate on the calendar. You have to add it or do they.
Agent: So you could add a campaign here or let me show you where I, my screens or a little out of the sink here.
Agent: For example, when you go to create an email or a message, you could add, you could identify a campaign that already exists on your calendar.
Agent: So if I wanted to include this message as part of our, you know, push to apply for fall, that campaign will show up as a thin over in the campaign calendar.
Agent: You have to have that campaign set up and configured, or you manually add it in the calendar. So if you tag it here with a campaign that you've already set up, yes, it will appear in the calendar.
Agent: If you haven't done that and you just have a one-off send or an event or something, you would manually add that to the calendar. Yeah, so better, better, but not perfect is the way.
Agent: Just grab the Marketing Cloud calendar.
EndUser: Does this Marketing Cloud calendar by chance?
EndUser: I mean, like I'm sure it does, but can it think back into outlook for like if we were to have like a calendar we share between like a department now?
Agent: No. So that's one of those things I mentioned. If you want to use this calendar, you have to be in marketing cloud.
Agent: Another thing that I see a lot of admissions departments do to you guys, you know, Outlook users just create a shared calendar. Whoever the person is that creates things in the marketing calendar, you would create that
EndUser: Same campaign and your Outlook shared calendar so that people have a way to use it. I get it, it's manual, but that's, you know, that's, that's the way we see people do. Yeah, it's not the best feature.
Agent: It's not the best feature of [PRODUCT-1] for sure.
Agent: Anything else that we've missed that you all were specifically interested in seeing or Dr. [PERSON-25], if there is anything, I know you're a newer entrant into the conversation, but if there was anything that was specifically on your mind, happy to jump into those things too.
EndUser: Sorry, I know that question was directed for [PERSON-28]. And anybody. OK. I have a question, though, about the messages, some of these icons.
EndUser: Like, what is some of those in-app?
Agent: So in-app and push notifications, these are specific to mobile communications.
Agent: So if [ORG-1] now has a mobile app or has mobile apps in the future, You install [PRODUCT-6] in that app, and then you can do things like push banner notifications, push lock screen notifications out via that app.
Agent: Inbox communications work much the same way they just do it within within an email inbox so that once an email is delivered, we want to send another notification that emails they are waiting for you to see it.
Agent: Sms is what it sounds like. That's text messaging, [ORG-25]'s what it sounds like. That's for, you know, we see WhatsApp quite a bit with international recruiting, whether undergrad or graduate.
Agent: So that's another, another kind of out of the box connection that we have if you have WhatsApp or want to include WhatsApp in a journey, right?
Agent: It may be easier because of time zones and other things rather than trying to get someone just to go through email, give them the option, you know, look.
Agent: Send an email using interactive email would you prefer email check here or would you prefer to communicate via WhatsApp that would be a way to start segregating people by their preferred communication channel and give them an option to engage in both friends.
Agent: And we didn't talk much about the mobile studio components and I'm not sure how relevant they are or will be to you all with what you're doing but just to make sure that I've mentioned it.
Agent: There is the mobile code like [PERSON-3] said, the SMS, mobile code included within the Marketing Cloud additions in the mobile studio builder or when [PERSON-3] was showing those builders at the top and so that allows for the SMS sending of one two many like he's showing here and then there's also capabilities.
Agent: Again, may not be relevant, but for things like geo fencing around certain areas to send those triggered and targeted messages out like there's an open house event right near it or as you branch into more things like maybe current students become a part of [PRODUCT-1] [DATE-28], like notifications of tutoring options or events, things like that.
Agent: So all of that's available and included within marketing cloud. Those are just things that we didn't even get to talk much about [DATE-1], but I wanted to point out.
Agent: Any other questions, things that you need to know, want to know how to do, would like to do, can't do [DATE-1]. any of those questions.
EndUser: So this might have been mentioned to me, but is there any way like, is there like a test environment that we can play with it eventually?
EndUser: No, there is. No.
Agent: One of, so is this about before you evaluate and purchase or after when things are live?
Agent: Good question. I just said no straight. I was like, no, good, good ball of course.
Agent: And the reason I mention after things are live, one of, we see lots of customers, one of the uses of a business unit, when we were talking about that shared kind of organizational structure in marketing cloud, you could have a testing business unit where you go to do things in kind of a safe space, whether that's data integrations, Content tests, that sort of stuff.
Agent: And we see lots of campuses when they start to distribute marketing further to other departments.
Agent: That becomes kind of the training and safe space where people go to learn before they're activated and promoted up to the live sending business.
Agent: But there's not a trial. Unfortunately, there's not a trial. There's not a trial. You can have like a trial Marketing Cloud environment.
Agent: You can go through [LOC-1] and there may be some things you can do there that are like training related. [PERSON-1], but there isn't any ability to get into a trial for marketing.
Agent: Hopefully that gave you an idea of what, what. Marketing Cloud looks like [DATE-1] versus the Marketing Cloud that you have known up into this point.
Agent: Yeah, anything that we missed before we did great on time. I have a question. Yeah, since I was assuming it was like a different platform altogether since it's what we're already using and just add on.
EndUser: Do you still have to read to all the emails?
Agent: So you. The same. Yeah, you could absolutely migrate the existing [PRODUCT-5] that you have. There would be different methods for doing that. Off-prem can present different options. The lowest tech option, copy and paste.
Agent: There's also utility inside a [PRODUCT-1] called package manager, which is what it sounds like. You can bundle up packages, export them, import them into your new environment.
Agent: Or if you have colleagues at other campuses that have [PRODUCT-5] that you like, you can even share packages between campuses.
EndUser: So there are lots of methods, lots of methods, [PERSON-21], to replicate [PRODUCT-5] that you already have. It's not like the same system just add-ons to it. It's an actual different
Agent: Whole system we're using. It is. It is a differently architected system. It's not just a flip-a-switch upgrade to a code line thing. It is a new system.
Agent: But we built the ability and to migrate stuff that you want to keep. We don't expect that you would have to rebuild every email that you've ever sent.
Agent: That's something that package manager will do pretty quickly and deploy into your new environment.
EndUser: Ok. Thank you. Any
Agent: Good questions?
Agent: I think, [PERSON-25] is, I'll go with [PERSON-27] to, you know, get someone you all can speak with. Because I think functionality, or I shouldn't, you know, let me just ask the question, not as soon.
Agent: Did the functionality that we showed [DATE-1], like, do you feel like we've gotten their sort of checkbox on what you were hoping to see from functionality?
Agent: I think the outstanding question implemented like the, I was saying the question is still the recruit data possibilities.
EndUser: Yeah, I think that's the, the standing question of how it would look in recruit. I think it covered [DATE-1] so much. And I think truly it only kind of scratched the surface of, yeah.
EndUser: Options that could be added and implemented into what we are already doing and just to enhance everything that we do and be more efficient.
EndUser: I mean, I feel like it could take [DATE-21] to like really dive in and see all of the features.
EndUser: But at least on our side, I think truly seeing how it works with recruit and how it would defer to what it currently is now is like probably the number of questions.
Agent: Okay, so I will message [PERSON-9]. I know he's out. The rest of [DATE-25] on an on site in [GPE-3].
Agent: When do you all close for the semester?
Agent: [DATE-22] or [DATE-27]?
Agent: Are you are you around [DATE-27]?
Agent: What does that look like?
Agent: [PERSON-1]'s like, I'm here, I'm here forever. The 25nd is the official [DATE-27] here.
EndUser: Some of us take off earlier than that.
Agent: Yep, as you should, as you should. I'll get with [PERSON-9] and just see what options he has to offer as far as conversations and references that he might suggest.
Agent: I'm not sure if those references on the other side are around [DATE-27] either. I know some places are closing us up [DATE-22].
EndUser: So I'll take that as a big action item. Um, users, so like a lot of the stuff seems to be like you have to be a user in marketing cloud.
EndUser: You know how we are right now, we don't have very many users in there. Number one, we have to.
EndUser: Can we have a limited amount of users?
EndUser: Um, and we don't want everyone touching this because it's absolutely dangerous. So what is the user allowance and is that a,
Agent: You know, and what, and what we've been thinking through for you all in a new edition to accommodate email volume specifically [PRODUCT-5] contact volume, things like that. You're going to have more users.
Agent: Allocated to your account, then you will ever use. It comes with 99 users. And within the, you're not going to get to 92, that's just more of a, that's just utilization included.
Agent: But within user roles and permissions, if there are reasons to define different user roles and permissions for who can actually modify content, who can send content, who's approving [PRODUCT-5] before it goes out.
Agent: All of those are roles and permissions that get created and defined. But yeah, [PERSON-21], I don't foresee you needing 90, just
EndUser: That's what will be available. No. Okay. Thank you.
Agent: Yeah, no problem. And I know we are right over time.
Agent: So any other outstanding items for me to work on here, finding out some other conversations, but anything else that's top of mind and a big lingering question for anybody?
EndUser: I guess I'm just thinking like, step. So we'll talk, try and get that conversation with another recruit user. And then I think our recruit team is like looking at what ethos timeline is, though it might be very long.
EndUser: And [PERSON-21], I'm looking at you, but I know that you probably don't want me to look at you for that.
EndUser: Because like, like my eggs are right in and the eat. Well, I know. It's another, it's another team that we have to work with, which is.
EndUser: Yeah, did it get did it happen on the 10?
EndUser: Well, we have we're on practice the test or whatever. We're on [DATE-26]. Yeah. So we're on [DATE-26]. So I guess it's somewhere on the back end, but we have to have like ethos. Yeah.
EndUser: You actually install it. It exists. It is a real thing in the world. It exists. But I can't say anything on the record. I like that it exists. They say it exists. That exists. Yeah. That's a positive step.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: So yes, [PERSON-17], if that's the if that of the integration path of interest and those are there are those questions. I think to [PERSON-9]'s point, there may be ways to do integration now that don't prevent.
Agent: Don't prevent leveraging ethos once it's available from the team fully to consider, right?
Agent: You know, if you can't take the whole big leap into ethos immediately, maybe there are ways, and you know, [PERSON-9], we mentioned SFTP even, things like that can be put into place potentially. But that's a good point.
EndUser: And then- Yeah, I keep us like on scale. schedule because I know that our clock is ticking towards [DATE-34].
EndUser: And so I want to at least make sure that we're making some progress towards Implementation of this product, knowing we need other,
Agent: You know, solutions to get the data over. Yeah. And there's another thing that I'm thinking about as I know I've shared with everybody on this call, so sorry to be a program record.
Agent: But is the [DATE-34], right?
Agent: So it's [DATE-37]. [PERSON-9]'s turned out a little bit on the lower end as well, potentially for your implementation.
Agent: But I like to be a pessimist in terms of timelines on Implementation just because we all know how that goes, right?
Agent: So if we say, funny to [DATE-26], Well, that's kicking off a project in [DATE-33]-ish, right?
Agent: And you're not sending, you're sending far before that [DATE-26] to be clear.
Agent: But wanting to be able to say, let's cut the contracts we have now and move off of it, not have duplicative costs coming into the new fiscal.
Agent: That puts you in probably a name something executed in [DATE-37], which as we talked about, I also have incentives available to save costs for a [DATE-37] purchase.
Agent: And all of those things that we haven't gone into full detail about yet.
Agent: But I'm happy to, even if that's [DATE-27], whoever the right folks are, if it's to you, [PERSON-27], [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-21], go through what that incentive cost means tangibly.
Agent: If it's easier to see it, we can go through that too. Cause I've just sort of thrown out numbers of what that might look like, but I'm happy to say.
Agent: Let's go in and actually look at it, cost benefit of a [DATE-37] purchase versus a [DATE-33] purchase.
EndUser: If that's helpful. If we can, yes, I think we're in the throes of budget pitching right now and if this is to be implemented [DATE-34], like this is the time.
EndUser: I'm out quite a bit [DATE-27], but I'm also going to be driving a lot. So like I
Agent: Can't understand. Like we could even give something, you know, like, like I'm hoping [DATE-22] [TIME-4] even.
Agent: I mean, I just I would have to work with my manager to put together some stuff, but If [DATE-22] [TIME-4] is even better so that you're not driving in a car to listen to numbers of I'm fine.
Agent: I can do that.
Agent: Are you talking this [DATE-22] or [DATE-26]?
Agent: Yeah, the 17th. I can even I can we can get some any other better than
EndUser: Yeah, if we could do like a quick [TIME-5] just like quick numbers.
EndUser: That way I didn't have maybe some of [DATE-27] to sit and let it, you know, let me tell [PERSON-9] a couple times, you know, drop through it and then, yeah, you got to be helpful.
EndUser: [PERSON-4], are you, are you out?
EndUser: I will probably be driving. Okay.
EndUser: Good [TIME-4], but, um, I'm happy to jump on a call or if [PERSON-25] and if you want to take that one. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I can do [DATE-26]. I can do [DATE-26] at
Agent: 21 or I can do [DATE-22] anytime after [TIME-6].
EndUser: [ORG-22] doesn't look great, but I could do. Any like two or three. Ready time after three and then [PERSON-4], I can loop you in on what those numbers are. Well, you went and then.
EndUser: Yeah, I want to invite. And if I can join if I'm sitting in a car, then I'll join while.
Agent: Awesome. Well, I'll get that together. I'll send over the invite. And this way we just slide out, you know, and we see how things move forward from here. We'll talk then.
EndUser: Sounds good. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much. Great. Thanks for your time, everyone. Thank you.
EndUser: Bye, [PERSON-26]. Bye.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Answer to this question is unclear. The customer did express interest in the product's capabilities and how it could potentially enhance their current processes. However, they also had questions about how the product would integrate with their existing systems, particularly their recruitment system. They mentioned that they would need to have a conversation with another recruit user and look at the ethos timeline. Therefore, it is not entirely clear if they feel the product meets their needs without further information.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and demonstrating the features of the product. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. Data Integration: The sales rep briefly touched upon data integration with the customer's existing systems, but did not spend enough time understanding the specific data sources and how they would be integrated with the product.
2. User Access: The sales rep mentioned that the product comes with 99 users, but did not spend enough time understanding the customer's current user access and how it would need to be adjusted for the new product.
3. Implementation Timeline: The sales rep mentioned the implementation timeline, but did not spend enough time understanding the customer's specific timeline and how it would impact the implementation process.
4. Budget and Incentives: The sales rep briefly mentioned budget and incentives, but did not spend enough time understanding the customer's budget constraints and how the incentives could be used to offset the costs.
5. Competitors: The sales rep did not mention any competitors or how the product compares to other similar products in the market.

Overall, the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific needs and challenges in these areas to provide a more tailored demonstration and pitch.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the interactive email feature of the seller's product, which allows for the collection of information from recipients directly within the email. They also mentioned the potential for this feature to increase engagement and the possibility of passing hidden fields for progressive forms. The customer also mentioned the potential for this feature to lower the friction required to get information from someone and make it easier to collect.",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"Answer to this question is unclear. The transcript does not provide clear information on any specific concerns or objections expressed by the customer that would prevent the deal from closing. The customer did express interest in understanding how the data from the seller's product would integrate with their existing systems, specifically recruit, and how it would look in their system. However, this does not necessarily indicate a concern or objection that would prevent the deal from closing.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Answer: Yes, the sales rep asked several open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""Is there value there from the pieces that [PERSON-3] shows above and beyond what you have [DATE-1]?""
2. ""If there are questions, comments, thoughts as we go through, we'd love to hear that and make sure that we are on the right path with what we show.""
3. ""Any objections, questions, burning thoughts or requests before we hop into it.""
4. ""So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5]. Questions about that?""
5. ""So once we have the data, we can do fun things with it. Any questions about this?""
6. ""So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5]. Questions about that?""
7. ""So any piece of data that [ORG-1] has, you can connect to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud data model. Yes, the majority of that data today lives and recruit. But if that changes in the future, if there are new efforts in the future, or if you just want to expand what you're doing, because there's a lot of efficiency that we'll find in [PRODUCT-1] now, you can do that pretty easily, and you can spin up these hubs and spokes as needed.""
8. ""So if in the future, there's a different [ORG-6] or a different financial aid system, or just some really important VIP recruiting spreadsheet that you get from somewhere that needs to be related into the system so you can use it. There is a way to do that. That's what the data designer, what [PRODUCT-1] data is about.""
9. ""So questions about data or any of that stuff with the understanding that a huge portion of the work for data design and making this happen is what [PERSON-9] from [ORG-9] discussed with you [DATE-3].""
10. ""So once we have a... question. Sorry. This might be maybe more of an offline question for [PERSON-10] afterwards.""
11. ""So if you think of those vertical communication channels, let's just call them web text and email, you manage those kind of separately and individual ly a day and that causes problems with efficiency because you have to repeat efforts and you' re trying to knit those things together.""
12. ""So if that sounds good to everybody, I'll turn it over to [PERSON-3].""
13. ""Any objections, questions, burning thoughts or requests before we hop into it.""
14. ""So once we have the data, we can do fun things with it. Any questions about this?""
15. ""So one of the first things that you might want to do is some segmentation or suppression. Here I am inside of email studio, excuse me, email studio and I am creating a data filter.""
16. ""So maybe you want to create a special campaign that's focusing only on out-of-state students. So we wanna look for a state not equal to [GPE-1] and we can do as many nested and ors as we want here.""
17. ""So if we wanted this to be and this to be or, or if you wanna create really interesting program specific, defined specific degree programs, degree tracks, If you're looking for only women from a certain zip code that you want to target with some sort of outreach, you can do that.""
18. ""The idea is that any piece of data that you have, you can define drag and drop.""
19. ""So this, I hope this sounds more fun than it looks because this is kind of the least <inaudible> thing in terms of what it looks like in marketing cloud, but it's probably the most powerful because this opens up literally any piece of data with roles and permissions to anyone who needs to use it in their context.""
20. ""So gone are [DATE-4] where you have to request information or a query or a list or a segment from somebody who understands recruit who understands banner or understands [DATE-5]. Questions about that?""
21. ""So the data filters will show up everywhere. We'll see them again in [PRODUCT-5] targeting.""",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question: ""So I love this. This is the kind of stuff that I geek out over. How would this information look like coming back into recruit? Like... I'm trying to envision what it would look like because I can see the person record and the activities and the emails that they're receiving, although for us, texts aren't on there and things like that.""
   Answer: The customer seemed more engaged because they started thinking about ways to implement the solution and how it would integrate with their existing systems.

2. Question: ""Do you have other institutions or another, maybe, user that is a recruit, a [NORP-1] user that is currently using [WORK_OF_ART-1], anyone that might be interested in chatting with us, that could show us real time, kind of how they do it?""
   Answer: The customer seemed more engaged because they showed interest in learning from other users' experiences and seeing real-world examples of the solution in action.

3. Question: ""I'm not thinking metrics, but I'm thinking about you know, calendaring and sending that out. I think about an email that [PERSON-4] sends every [DATE-25] of like, here's what's upcoming for our, like, here's the communications that are going out. Now that may be different now if we incorporate your new builder because those, some of those triggered communications, but some of those date specific communications that we want our team to know and be aware of as their students get in.""
   Answer: The customer seemed more engaged because they started considering how the new solution could fit into their existing communication workflows and how it could help them better coordinate their efforts.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"The sales rep did a good job of explaining the features and capabilities of the product. However, there were a few instances where they could have better articulated the value proposition of the company or product.

1. When discussing the possibility of integrating data from different systems into the Marketing Cloud, the sales rep mentioned that it would require the help of an implementation team and that there are various integration methods available. However, they could have emphasized the benefits of integrating data from different systems, such as improved efficiency, better data analysis, and more personalized communication.
2. When discussing the possibility of using Marketing Cloud for mobile communications, the sales rep mentioned the different types of mobile communications, such as push notifications, in-app messages, and SMS. However, they could have emphasized the value of using Marketing Cloud for mobile communications, such as improved engagement, better targeting, and more personalized communication.
3. When discussing the possibility of using Marketing Cloud for digital advertising, the sales rep mentioned that it is not included out of the box with the Marketing Cloud but can be added if the customer would like. However, they could have emphasized the benefits of using Marketing Cloud for digital advertising, such as improved targeting, better tracking, and more personalized communication.
4. When discussing the possibility of using Marketing Cloud for email communication, the sales rep mentioned the different features and capabilities of the email studio. However, they could have emphasized the benefits of using Marketing Cloud for email communication, such as improved deliverability, better targeting, and more personalized communication.

Integration with their existing data systems, specifically how fields would come through from different entities like opportunity, person, and the application entity. They also asked about the possibility of sending data back to their recruit system.
2. They were unsure if the product would be able to replace their existing web form strategy and how it could supplement it.
3. They wanted to know how to delete a data source option from the replace string menu.

video_19792_167_6qr3y000000sarNAAQ,"Agent: Over to you, [PERSON-1]. That's all
Agent: Ready to go, perfect. I was just waiting for that little bond, know that the Recording had started. Thanks, [PERSON-2].
Agent: Okay guys, so we had a chat about probably [DATE-1], maybe a little bit longer now that we had a bit of a conversation around kind of, you know, where [PERSON-3] was going, where you are growing, and how you are looking to really leverage more data intelligence, more artificial intelligence, and using that to drive your customer experience.
Agent: So within [ORG-1], we have this term [PERSON-4]. So we kind of productize all of our different artificial intelligence areas of platform with that term [PERSON-4] beforehand.
Agent: Okay, so you'll hear lots and lots of different areas of the platform with the name [PERSON-4] in front of them [DATE-2].
Agent: And what we wanted to do in [DATE-2]'s session, so in [DATE-2]'s session, we just want to kind of, I suppose, inspire a little bit.
Agent: We want to show you a little bit of the functionalities that we have around [PERSON-4] for the Marketing Cloud platform and how we could look to increase the relevance and the context when you're communicating with your customers across all the different channels.
Agent: So we want to drill into some of those areas that we think would be really, really functional and really, really helpful for you guys.
Agent: Now, I'm going to show a couple of slides just to kind of set the scene around what we're going to talk about. And the first slide I have to show is this particular one here.
Agent: So this is just a legal statement that we have to show at the start of our call, just to let you know that [ORG-1] is a publicly traded company.
Agent: Everything we are going to show you [DATE-2] is currently available.
Agent: But should we make any forward-looking statements or should we talk about any roadmap functionality?
Agent: All purchasing decisions should be made on currently available technology. Okay. You don't have to read all of this, don't worry. We can print it at the end too.
Agent: So [ORG-1] itself is really a platform and when we talk about a platform what we mean by that is the ability for you to to build on top of the [ORG-1] layer all of the different communication strategies that you would want across all of the different business areas that you would use to engage with your customers.
Agent: So when we talk about the [ORG-1] platform, it's really all about, you know, how can we leverage these different tools to improve our customer experience, improve our internal employee engagement, improve the satisfaction across the board to make sure we are delivering the best representation of our business to our customers.
Agent: And as you can see here, it covers many, many different areas where we would interact and engage with our customers. And of course, we're going to be focusing on this Marketing component of the Salesforce Customer 341 platform [DATE-2].
Agent: So within the Marketing area, there are lots and lots of different areas where we use artificial intelligence to drive effective customer engagement. Okay, and we do that in a couple of different ways.
Agent: So one is to really [ORG-2] how we're communicating with our customers.
Agent: One is optimizing the performance to make sure that we're getting a lot of visual insights, we're getting a lot of understanding of how different campaigns are performing, and then we actually need to be able to make sure that we're actioning all of those different insights.
Agent: So we're not just getting surfaced that information that we're doing something with it, that we have actionable insight that we can go ahead and we can use across all of our different Marketing campaigns.
Agent: And in each of those different pillars, there's lots and lots of different pieces of functionality. So you can see, you know, we have [PERSON-5]-time optimization, engagement scoring, Marketing insights, Content tagging and selection.
Agent: Okay, that's just a couple of examples of the areas of [PERSON-4] that we have across the Marketing platform.
Agent: But not all of these pieces of functionality are necessarily going to be the ones that are gonna deliver the most value for you.
Agent: So we wanted to kind of drill into a couple of areas that based on our conversation, the last.
Agent: Time we really think will be beneficial for [PERSON-6] and will help you kind of move forward and increase your customer engagement . So the first one is personalization recipes.
Agent: So this is basically making sure that we are recommending the best product, the best content, the best categories of restaurants, of food that people can go ahead and engage with.
Agent: And we wanna do that in real-time across the mobile app and of course through all of the email communication that we are sending out as well. And really, this is all being driven by behavior tracking.
Agent: So it's understanding all the behavior that's happening within the mobile app and being able to create what we call affinity modeling in the back end to really understand what each customer, what each prospective customer is up to.
Agent: And then we boost all of that using our machine learning algorithms to make sure that we are delivering those one-to-one personalized recommendations in real-time across those different channels.
Agent: And this is one of the areas that I'm going to drill into a little bit further when we jump into the demo component, alongside the personalization decisions.
Agent: Okay, and this is really all about delivering next best action, next best offer. So this is using an algorithm called contextual bandit, so it's a multi-arm bandit that basically goes through.
Agent: And again, it looks at everything that has happened on an individual's record, but it also looks at all of the different offers, the different promotions, the different [PRODUCT-1] that's available and it looks at that in relation to business value.
Agent: S o what is the promotion or the offer that's going to deliver the most value fo r the customer but also the most value for the business ?
Agent: And how can we balance the two two make sure we are putting that next best offer in front of the right customers.
Agent: And then I'll be handing it over to [PERSON-7] who's going to go through a little bit more of the kind of the [PERSON-4] components when we're talking about messaging.
Agent: So talking about how we can use kind of some natural language processing to understand what tones, what words, what phrases we're using within our subject lines to try and get people to engage with the email [PRODUCT-1] that we're sending out and making sure that we're getting some actionable insights about how we can go ahead and we can optimize those subject lines.
Agent: There's also an area within [PRODUCT-2] selection.
Agent: So this is really all about making sure that, you know, within one single template, within one single email that's being sent out, that single email can look completely different to each and every individual that will open it.
Agent: Okay, it's going to be completely personalized in terms of, the banner, their header imagery, the content, the recommendations that are within that email.
Agent: And really, that's all being optimized to make sure that as soon as someone opens that email, they're going to be delivered the best piece of [PRODUCT-1] based on their most recent interaction.
Agent: Even if that email was, say, sent to [TIME-1] on a [DATE-3] [TIME-2], they happen to have engaged with the app at [DATE-4], maybe to order some breakfast, and then they go and look at the email.
Agent: That email will be able to change automatically in real-time based on that most recent interaction, even after the email was being sent out. Okay. And then the final pieces are in kind of Einstein Content tagging.
Agent: So helping to really organize all of your content, to help you decide, you know, how best to tag it, how best to organize all of your [PRODUCT-1] into a searchable library so that it will make it a lot easier for you to find, to search all of your content, and we'll make sure that you're just working within an area because we talk before about quite a large [PRODUCT-1] catalog.
Agent: So being able to see which are the images that are going to work most well for you for all of your different campaigns and making sure that you're able to find them very, very easily as well.
Agent: Ok. Hopefully, these features, these functionalities, these areas sound like they line up with what you're looking for based on our previous call.
Agent: But I'll just stop, I'll pause here for a second and just see if anyone has any comments, any questions so far.
EndUser: I just have a question more.
EndUser: How does I should AI decide, learns about customer, preference communication and channel, like time of [DATE-5], can I be tailored specific service or group to be one and like, what is the basic flexibility of adjusting the model?
Agent: So each of the different areas have slightly different models. So I kind of mentioned a couple. So there's been affinity model, there's been contextual bandit. There's also some alternating least squares that are being used in the recommendations.
Agent: So there's slightly different models for each one.
EndUser: It sounds like you're about the
Agent: Talking about send time optimization because you were talking best time to send out different emails. I'm not sure of the exact model that's used there.
Agent: But basically, the first time someone is sent to communication, we don't know anything about that person. We don't know. necessarily know when the best time to send it is.
Agent: But what we'll do is we'll look at people wit h similar behaviors, similar characteristics and say, right, well, similar people to that perso n tend to open the email at that time.
Agent: So for the first send, that's when they'll start to sen d that email.
Agent: But as that individual starts to engage more and more with the email [PRODUCT-1] that you'r e sending out, starts to engage more in the background with [GPE-1], we start to get more of an understandin g about when they're active and when they're most engaged.
Agent: And then going forward, [ORG-3] l you'll start to optimize their send time s.
EndUser: So it's not just using their engagement with the app, but also the channel and just wondering what level of parameters that we talked about here, because I'll give you our use case that we were thinking.
EndUser: We wanna optimize right time of descent, but we also know when I understand the time of the [GPE-2] specific service, for example, if you wanna go down the road.
EndUser: So that's why just to see if there is a flexibility to do something like that.
Agent: So when you say a specific service, so do you mean within the different offerings of <inaudible> house or do you mean different channels of communication?
EndUser: No, not channels, different offerings. We call services like right healing versus food. Okay. Yes.
EndUser: So yeah, users behave really differently for right heal versus food, right?
EndUser: Yeah. And food is sometimes, yeah, quite more frequent, which is right healing. And you can detect natural behavior amongst the two. So we're wondering like,
Agent: So you
Agent: Have one profile for each of the individual because it's going to look at all of the [PRODUCT-1] that is sent and then it will create a pattern for each individual.
Agent: But can do is within a window of send, you can actually choose what range you want to offer.
EndUser: What you
Agent: So for example, for a product that is a high-frequency purchase, when you send a communication, you can decide to choose the best time in a window of [TIME-3].
EndUser: So it's restricted
Agent: And then if it's for low frequency purchase, then you can put a [DATE-6] window and then it will pick the best time and date within [DATE-7].
EndUser: Okay. I assume there is also fallback timing and stuff like that, customization to.
Agent: If there's no information, then it will be sent at the preset date and time.
EndUser: Clear. Perfect.
Agent: Any other questions around any bad or any follow on questions from there?
Speaker 5: I just have a quick question on the offer optimization that you mentioned.
Speaker 5: So like one of the features that you mentioned here is that it's able to identify what is the right sort of offer for each customer and then plan. that if I'm correct.
Speaker 5: What I want to do, like, understand is that like, which offer work, which did not, there can be multiple criteria to judge that, right?
Speaker 5: So, some people might look at C-PAIR, some might look at customer acquisition cost, and then there are multiple others.
Speaker 5: So, is it possible for us to define the criteria of campaign success for [PERSON-4], and then based on that, optimize it?
Agent: Yeah, so I mean if I look at the screen that we have here, okay, so there are There is the ability for you to engineer to feature engineer the algorithm that runs those personalization decisions for next best off for next best action.
Agent: So you have the ability to influence it fairly heavily for all the different criteria that is important to you.
Agent: And it's actually not showing it on this screen here, but there's a little area that you can select right at the top that says, do you want to optimize this for conversions, for clicks, for purchases.
Agent: So you are able to select kind of what your overall or overarching goal is.
Agent: Or if it's something like customer lifetime value but those are pre-set goals It is impossible for you to create your own goal You would have to select one of those [ORG-4] r and then you would be able to influence i t through the feature engineering that we see on screen here .
Speaker 5: Alright, yeah, that address is part of the question and then again, you know, like. If you kind of try to kind of. Map it without doing right now and how we can use asking for this, but.
Speaker 5: Lot of questions that might come up and I want to kind of block the entire time for that.
Speaker 5: So do you guys have any sort of demo interface which which we can, you know, like me play around way to know how things are working and can be more specific in our questions. Maybe.
Agent: So we don't actually offer trial or demo versions that customers can access.
Agent: But what we can do is [DATE-2], as I said, we're looking to it as an inspiration session to just make sure that we're on point with what you guys are looking for.
Agent: And then we can do deeper dive sessions into each of the individual areas that interest you most, and we can, of course, get more into the technicalities and the back ends of those different areas through further screen shares.
Speaker 5: All right, thanks for clarifying, [PERSON-8]. No worries. Thank you.
Agent: Okay. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to jump in and I'm just going to show you a little bit of some of the areas that I've mentioned. So the recipes and the [PERSON-4] decisions. Okay.
Agent: Now, I'm going to show you this through the context of a kind of a fictitious business that we have created for demonstration purposes. Okay.
Agent: Now, this particular business is it's an it's an outdoor kind of hiking and equipment branded store. So, bit similar to like the north face. Okay.
Agent: So when I've come to this particular website now, I'm actually visiting as an anonymous visitor.
Agent: And I think the important thing to mention here is I'm going to focus just on the web channel for the purposes of this demonstration, but exactly the same sort of behavior can be tracked and can be logged across the mobile app.
Agent: Okay, still a little bit more visual to be able to show it from the website in terms of the demonstration.
Agent: So I'm an anonymous visitor on the website right now, and everything on the website's quite generic, okay?
Agent: So I've got the call to action to join a loyalty program. I've got different areas and categorizations that I can go ahead and interact with.
Agent: So of course these could be, if we were to think about, you know, the food sites, the food ordering side of <inaudible>, these could be the different categories of restaurants, the different categories of cuisine, that I could go ahead and then interact with.
Agent: So for example, I might go ahead and I might click into the women category here and then start to kind of narrow down my search by starting to look at footwear.
Agent: And again, just kind of use your imagination a little bit to kind of run with me and talk about this in terms of the categorizations that we might have for, like I said, for the locality of the cuisine or the different cuisines and types of food ordering services that we have.
Agent: Okay. So I'll scroll down here and I'm actually going to go ahead and I'm going to filter this activity here by running.
Agent: So I can go ahead and I can drill down even deeper into all of the different products and to all of the different categories that are available.
Agent: And I'm going to go and I'm going to click on these kind of gray and pink nice running shoes. So a couple of things are already happening on this particular website right now.
Agent: So one thing is I'm being told how many people are viewing this product right now. So this could be something that could be interesting to people from a restaurant perspective.
Agent: So if there are a lot of people engaging with a restaurant at the moment or a lot of people pushing through orders at the moment, potentially that might tell someone, this particular restaurant is very, very busy.
Agent: There might be a longer lead time for my order. Maybe I might wanna go in and check. a different restaurant with similar cuisine that's also in the locality as well .
Agent: This tends to work as just to show either popularity of a restaurant or potentially to show that urgency. I want to get my order in right now because there's a lot of people browsing, a lot of people engaging.
Agent: Now, if I scroll down a little bit further here, we're already starting to make some recommendations. So in this particular use case, we're just looking at similar items.
Agent: So we're looking at different things that we know about the product that someone's engaging with.
Agent: So whether that is the cuisine itself, whether that's the certain ingredients of the cuisine or the different dishes that they're looking at, we can go ahead and then start to make some recommendations about potentially similar items.
Agent: And all of this is, and all of this is still happening now in that anonymous state OK ?
Agent: So even in this anonymous state, in the background, we are creating a record within [PRODUCT-3] for all of that activity and all of that engagement.
Agent: And if I go ahead and click into one of these anonymous records, this is what it actually looks like in the background. This is the kind of the customer profile that's being built on this particular anonymous visitor.
Agent: And what it's doing here is it's picking up IP address information. So we know what city and what locality someone is interested in. We can see if they've ever had any purchases with us.
Agent: We get their average order value or their customer lifetime value.
Agent: And on this timeline in the middle, we'd be able to see the different dates, the different times that they've been interacting on the mobile app, or potentially making any orders.
Agent: Okay, so we're getting lots and lots of information even though this person is anonymous.
Agent: For probably the most powerful part of this profile is really coming from this affinity matrix that we see at the top here, or this affinity wheel that we see at the top.
Agent: Now this is completely customizable, okay?
Agent: So this is, you know, kind of driven towards that e-commerce, that online retail business we were just looking at. And it's looking at things like, you know, the categories of, you know, running outdoors, hiking.
Agent: It's also looking at the different styles of the items and maybe other different attributes about those items. As we said, this could be the different categories of the different cuisines. It could be dish types.
Agent: It could be specific ingredients. It could also be things to look out for people, like if they're gluten free, if they have another allergy, if they have some sort of intolerance.
Agent: We could also be Recording that information based on the dishes or the different restaurants that they're engaging with as well. OK. I'm sorry. Sorry.
EndUser: This is all.
EndUser: Depending on the level of data we provide, right?
EndUser: Or we can define basically like mapping within the [ORG-5] studio.
Agent: Yeah, so it's basically actually all being driven by a catalog, either a catalog of [PRODUCT-1] or a catalog of products.
Agent: So if we look at think of like, obviously, in this case, because we're talking about an online e-commerce retailer, they're actual individual products, okay?
Agent: And they have all of these kind of tags and these categorizations associated with them. For you, it would be more of a [PRODUCT-1] catalog.
Agent: So it would be, you know, imagery, blocks of text, different information about the restaurants, you know, promotions that are aligned to. different restaurants and categories as well. Okay now.. .
Agent: We would say recommend that this all gets uploaded as a kind of an individual kind of catalog. That's kind of the easiest way for it to get ingested into the system.
Agent: And then we would say, you know, create these different kind of attributes, these different dimensions that you want to record.
Agent: And the more of these attributes and the more of these dimensions, you can record around those different pieces of content, then kind of the deeper and the more granular we can go into our recommendations.
Agent: Does that answer your question?
Agent: Yeah, yeah,
EndUser: Yeah. Actually, yes. OK, perfect, perfect.
Agent: Ok, and so obviously, you know, that profile that we have, that affinity wheel, all of that event stream and that event tracking, all of that is being kind of built up to build this picture in the background of, you know, our anonymous engagers or also of our prospective customers and returning customers as well.
Agent: And all of that data is then being used in this machine learning area.
Agent: So for these [PERSON-4] recipes, so that we can go ahead and we can make different recommendations to all of the different users that are interacting across the system.
Agent: So we saw those, you know, those similar items that we were seeing down the bottom on this particular page here. That's being driven by machine learning in the background.
Agent: It's looking at just, like I said, all of the different attributes on someone's record and finding similar items based on the product. page they're currently engaging with.
Agent: But this could also be, you know, trending items, most popular items, or it could be next best recommended product for you as well .
Agent: Now, if I scroll up here and I go back to my home page, so a couple of things are now going to change on the home page based on when I was that initial anonymous visitor.
Agent: And it's these call to actions here. So these are my kind of my next best actions that are popping up on the screen here. So I've been engaging with a running shoe, been engaging with that particular product.
Agent: So my next best action is to go ahead and start to engage further with the running category. So now it's sort of saying, right, we know you're interested.
Agent: Interested in running shoes, what about engaging with the running category so you can loo k at other things like running leggings, running jackets, maybe fitness trackers, things lik e that.
Agent: So it's starting to try and get me to engage with the broader category rather tha n just trying to drill down and only go ahead and recommend the information about the specifi c dish or the specific restaurant I was looking at .
Agent: Okay. And then another call to action here is just to go ahead, you know, to register, to join a community, to share ratings, to share feedback and things like that.
Agent: Now in this particular case, I'm going to go ahead and I'm start to kind of navigate like I'm moving away from the website.
Agent: And again, this is just another call to action that's popping up to try and get someone to leave their email address.
Agent: Now in the case of [PERSON-6], pretty much everybody's already going to be identified on the mobile app, but we can just have, you know, those triggers or those indicators that someone is about to navigate away from the app or close the app down and use that kind of behavioral triggers, maybe pop up a push notification or an in-app message with some sort of little offer or a little promotion to try and get them to complete their order or try and get them to, you know, complete their ride and just go ahead and try to get, you know, the optimize that conversion as much as possible before they navigate away.
Agent: Okay. And I heard a little ping-bong there. So I'll have some right hand.
EndUser: Yeah.
Speaker 5: Those are the reasons. So like I just said, a question on the personalization that you spoke of. So what I want to understand is that on that part, there are two aspects.
Speaker 5: One is capturing the intent of the user, which you kind of in here said that the user is interested in running. And the next is action. And that is display this [PRODUCT-1] card. or give this offer.
Speaker 5: So, like within this personalization, how do we define, you know, what are the intents to tag users to?
Speaker 5: And then, like, what are the levers we have to then define, so how we basically put actions against those intents?
Agent: Yeah, yeah. So that all gets created when you're actually creating the campaign itself.
Agent: So whether you're creating it as a web campaign, a mobile campaign, or an email campaign, you can actually, you know, you decide the piece of [PRODUCT-1] that you want, and then you attribute the different actions.
Agent: So whether it's something like it's exit intent, whether it's a different pop up, whether it's a particular type of group of recommendations that you want to go ahead and attribute to that, you will define those rules as you're creating the campaign in there.
Agent: As well .
Agent: Okay, so it's really, it's what we kind of call almost gray or white box kind of algorithms because you do have the ability to influence it and to tweak it, but you can't completely remodel it or design absolutely everything about it.
Agent: There's a certain level of the algorithms that's kind of locked down, but you do have that ability to sort of to influence that, you know, the intent, do different triggers and the outcome that you're trying to generate. Okay.
EndUser: Just one question here.
EndUser: This means that basically model can predict the simulate set of users based on their engagement with the content, right?
EndUser: We don't need to even go into the transactions.
Agent: Into individual purchases?
EndUser: Yeah, yeah.
Agent: No, no, no. So I mean, yeah, we can we can start to make recommendations and we can start to make, you know, next best actions on someone simply based on how they've been engaging.
Agent: They don't necessarily ever have to have converted to a purchase. There's a lot of information that you can kind of gather from someone just about how they're engaging.
Agent: Like, I know I actually do this, I'm terrible for this, on the Just Eat app here in [GPE-3].
Agent: I will always, when I'm a little bit hungover and I maybe have few too many drinks, I'm always on the app and I'm like faffing around, I can't decide like do I want to like.
Agent: Eat loads of carbs, I don't want to be really healthy And then I'll keep closing the act down Because I'm like, no, you should make something [PERSON-1], I don't order anything I have that internal conflict with myself So I'm not ordering necessarily at that time But there's lots and lots of informatio n about those patterns that are quite interestin g to learn about me This happens every [DATE-8] morning [PERSON-1] clearly has a little conflict with hersel f about what she wants to order And maybe if a little in that message popped up and said we're going to give you [PERCENT-1] off a few orde r in [DATE-9] .
Agent: Might be the little trigger I need to just be like, yeah, that's the world of the universe telling me I need to order all the cards, you [PERSON-9] Yeah, So yeah, [PERCENT-2] can be driven by the behavior side of things as well.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: And this can be, we can be, can choose what we want to like drive as a goal, right?
EndUser: Like, would it be based on the behavior or transactions?
EndUser: We can switch this.
Agent: Is this Yeah, so the algorithms and cells, so something like the recommendations, like the [PERSON-4] recipes, like we're looking at on screen here and the decisions, they are always going to be driven by behavior and by transactions.
EndUser: The local customization?
Agent: Just that's just the way the algorithms are built.
Agent: It will always take them into account, but it will prioritize the purchases and the transactions because they're the things that you actually converted on and the things that you actually bought.
Agent: The behavior side of things is interesting as well to influence it, but it will put a heavier weighting on the conversions and the purchases. mattress . but it will always take both of them into account.
EndUser: Perfect, perfect.
Agent: Okay, so just to quickly show you then what a record might look like for someone who is a little bit more built up, who's a little bit more engaged, so you can start to see that the different areas of the affinity wheel are just building out a lot more on this particular person's record.
Agent: We've got their lifetime value, how many orders, their average order value here as well. And also you can see all of these different kind of bubbles on the timeline.
Agent: And each of these represents a visit to the app or to the website. And the bigger that bubble, the longer that particular person has been engaging with the app, the more they've been engaging with the content.
Agent: Now the thing about this is it's probably going to be very, very rare, but you would ever really want to look at an individual person's record.
Agent: But the idea of this is just to give you an idea of all of the information that's being captured in order to feed the artificial intelligence engine.
Agent: So that you understand how it's being built out, the event stream of all of the data that's being captured, how they're being driven into the different kind of the segments so that we can go ahead and make those recommendations.
Agent: But the likelihood of you ever actually drilling down and looking at race So this record is probably actually pretty small . Okay, unless maybe she brings in, she has a service complaint or some sort of service issue. Okay.
Agent: So, In terms of the initial part of the demo to show you a little bit around [PERSON-4] personalization [PERSON-4] decisions. I'm going to stop it there.
Agent: Okay, as I said, we can do further sessions to deep dive into each of these areas, but I want to give [ORG-6]
Agent: A little bit of time to drill into the [PRODUCT-1] side of things because I know the [PRODUCT-1] tracking the insights and things like that. We're very important as well.
Agent: But just before I swap over, just to check if there's any more questions or any other comments there at all.
Agent: Not for
EndUser: My shade. Okay, perfect, perfect.
Agent: Okay, so I'm just going to stop sharing my screen. I'm going to hand it over to [PERSON-10]. As I said, those two areas were what we call [PERSON-4] recommendations, [PERSON-4] decisions for an aspects action.
Agent: So we can do individual sessions on each of those if needed, and I'll hand you over to [PERSON-7] now so she can jump through the other areas of [PERSON-4]. Thanks guys. Thank
EndUser: You.
Agent: Perfect. Thank you, [PERSON-1]. So just before I actually jump into the [PRODUCT-1] creation, I'm going to give you a broad overview of the Marketing platform.
Agent: So here the idea is that on the home page you really have the comment center where you're going to be able to pilot the different activities.
Agent: So what you have is first on the left you have all of your different studios and you have to imagine that the studio is a Marketing channel that you can activate.
Agent: So you're going to find all of your emails anything regarding mobile so that will take into account SMS, WhatsApp, but also anything regarding push and push notification in app.
Agent: You also have the capacity to link with social media platform for organic posting or for paid advertising campaign. And then you have the link with your desk or your app or your desktop website, which would be [ORG-7].
Agent: And that's what [PERSON-1] just showed you before. Once you have all of the different channels, you can then activate them and you can create experience with by mixing all of these channels together.
Agent: So that's what we would find in the different builders. The builders will allow you to create connected experience.
Agent: So for example, in [ORG-8], that's where you're going to be able to build multi-channel engagement programs to start sending [PRODUCT-1] to your customers and then being able to adapt your behavior depending on what they are doing and how they are engaging.
Agent: So typically, that's in [ORG-8], that you would build maybe, and welcome programs, birthday programs, engagement programs, re-engagement programs for inactive users, those kind of scenarios.
Agent: What we also have is all of the different [PERSON-4] capabilities related to Marketing cloud.
Agent: So just like [PERSON-1] mentioned a little bit at the beginning of the presentation in the slides, we have a lot of artificial intelligence features that are naturally integrated on the platform.
Agent: So [DATE-2] I'll make a focus especially on [FAC-1] selection and I'll show you how we can use engagement scoring, same time optimization and engagement frequency directly within our journey tool.
Agent: Do you have any questions so far?
Agent: Okay, perfect.
Agent: So what I'll do is right away, I'll detail into our [PRODUCT-1] builder, which is kind of our library of assets, which is the place where I'm able to create Marketing content, [ORG-2] that content, and then use that [PRODUCT-1] in my different journeys or for my different communications.
Agent: So typically here, I'll show you an example of a Marketing email for [ORG-9], so the same brand as [PERSON-1] used before.
Agent: So I'll show you how very easily we can create that content, use the different building functionalities, and then how we can add a layer of artificial intelligence to [ORG-2] the display of that email.
Agent: But first big first things first.
Agent: So when we open the email, when we open our builder, we have on the left the different components that can then be used to drag and drop on the canvas and then build the different blocks of our email.
Agent: So what we can see is that we have the basic components that are necessary to build our content. So for example, the button to add the call to action.
Agent: We also have the text, the image block that allows us to Personalize the email very easily. I just drag, I drop the block on my canvas and I can build my email.
Agent: But what we also have is more advanced functionalities that will allow us to go further in the way we are customizing our email.
Agent: The first one is AD testing, we can create different variation within one email to try different content.
Agent: We can also create dynamic Content where we will display different blocks, different components depending on the value of a field, so the value of an attribute for each customer.
Agent: For example, depending on their preferred food or their preferred services with Chareem, we could display different banners, different promotions, different offers.
Agent: What we also have is the link with artificial intelligence in order to automatically suggest some [PRODUCT-1] depending on the pool of assets, the pool of pictures and banners that the [PRODUCT-4] will select from depending on the set of criteria.
Agent: So this is where I'll deep dive a little bit more.
Agent: Just before I deep dive, I'll also show you how directly within emails we're going to be able to add forms, so it's called interactive forms, which we allow us to interact with our customer and get more insights about how they're liking our services, how they're liking our products.
Agent: So by putting these different questions, the different surveys directly within the [PRODUCT-1] of the email, we are making sure that we are gathering new information, centralizing that information in the [PRODUCT-5], and making sure that the experience is very smooth and transparent for the customer.
Agent: He doesn't have to log into a different platform or open another browser directly from the email from the mailbox. He can give us some information about his profile so that we can enrich our database.
Agent: Before I dive into the artificial intelligence, do you have any questions?
EndUser: Just the information is served back into [PRODUCT-6], right?
Agent: Exactly. It goes directly back into [PRODUCT-6] so that then from there you can either [ORG-2] future Content or you can create different branches and different journeys depending on what information he's sharing with you.
Agent: You know, so typically if you send them like some feedback surveys after each of the delivery, it's interesting if the grades are not very high to then be able to do a follow-up maybe with support.
EndUser: Okay. Cool. Just a
Speaker 5: Quick question from my side. So this is called customizing the Content for mail.
Speaker 5: But let's say if you have any other channels, for example, push in app or any custom channels, is it also possible to kind of customize for those channels?
Agent: To customize the [PRODUCT-1] of those directly from the tool.
Speaker 5: Yes.
Agent: Yes, so this is the email builder, but we also have the same type of builder for SMS and for push. I'll show you push and just in [TIME-4]. Thank you. Okay, perfect.
Agent: But so to show you a bit more in detail how we can actually [ORG-10] of the different emails, I'll give that in what we called [FAC-1] selection.
Agent: So the goal of [FAC-1] selection is to make sure that each customer is going to get different emails and personalized content, depending on their behavior and depending on the data that we have for this customer.
Agent: So by digging into a pool of assets, so an asset can be a picture, a banner, a promotion, we'll be able to automatically display the right message to the right customer.
Agent: And so how do we do that?
Agent: So the first thing is that we are going to build a pool of assets. So we'll define what we call an asset class.
Agent: So an asset class, for example, would be a banner at the top of my email, a banner for a specific event in a specific city.
Agent: And within that asset class, so within that specific banner, I'm going to have different variation. So for example, here, for this specific banner, I have 13 different assets. So I have different 14 different version of that specific banner.
Agent: So if I go back, then by configuring the asset attributes, that's how I'm going to be able to identify, okay, within that banner, how am I going to decide who will see what banner?
Agent: So for example, the attributes can be here the activity, the city, the language, but maybe for carrying it could be the type of food, the restaurant, the city, the language where they are ordering from.
Agent: Once I've decided those attributes, then I actually match those attributes with the attributes that I have on the profile of my consumer.
Agent: So that I know that for each banner, for example, which is regarding a specific type of food in [GPE-4], then I will match with the customer who also are in [GPE-4] and who are interested in that specific type of food.
Agent: So by setting up these rules, I'm going to make sure that I'm mapping my consumers attributes with all of my assets, all of my pictures, attributes.
Agent: And then using this matching, the artificial intelligence will automatically decide, okay, what banner do I need to display to which consumer?
Agent: And it will pick from the pool of assets automatically to change the different banners, depending on the consumer and depending on the different communications that I'm sending.
Agent: What I can do is I can influence a little bit the artificial intelligence. So for example, I can decide to put in place exclusion rules.
Agent: So if I take an example for Perim, I can decide that one of the exclusion rules is that I want to make sure that if my consumer is vegetarian, I will never show him a banner or a food chain or food restaurant that is not vegetarian.
Agent: So this is typically the type of rule that I can program based on an attribute that I have about my consumer. What I can also put in place is what we call Fatigue Rule.
Agent: Fatigue Rule is to program the [PRODUCT-4] to make sure that we are not showing the same image to the same customer again and again.
Agent: So I can decide that, for example, each specific asset, so each banner, each picture can only be displayed a maximum of ones, two or three times to a customer.
Agent: And then once it has been displayed more than three times, it cannot be automatically selected in my different emails.
Agent: In case I fall into that situation where the pictures have been displayed too many times per customer, then I have what we call a fallback asset.
Agent: So the fallback asset is a generic version of that banner that will be displayed to any customer who is not matching with the different criteria.
Agent: So that there's never nothing, there's never an empty block, you will be able to decide of a generic version of that specific banner.
Agent: Do you have any questions?
Agent: Does it make sense so far?
Speaker 6: Yeah, I have a quick question.
Speaker 6: So for assets, is there a limit in terms of mapping attributes to each asset?
Speaker 6: And If you wanted to use the same asset in multiple journeys or multiple communications, like, is that possible?
Speaker 6: Like, is that flexible enough for us to basically reuse it?
Agent: Yes. So, what you can do is, so each asset can be assigned to different asset classes, so that it's used in different content.
Agent: And for the limits of attributes for one asset, and I don't have any any information, precise information, I don't have the limit at the top of my head.
Agent: I look into it, but I think you have quite a lot of flexibility in the number of fields that you can put in place.
Agent: And I don't think there's a specific limit, but I'll look into it to make sure that if there's a specific number, I can share it with you.
Speaker 6: Yes, yes, that would be great. Thank you.
Agent: [PERSON-7], there's just a couple of chats or questions in the chat is what I meant to say.
Agent: One way of saying, will we get a notification if we're using the fallback assets often so we can add more relevant ones?
Agent: So I think this is something that you may show when I'm not sure in terms of Content insights and you know the different insights that pop up about the [PRODUCT-1] and things like that.
Agent: I think that is something you're going to show.
Agent: Am I right?
Agent: Yes, and it's something that you have in the performance analytics. You have visibility over which asset is being used the most and in which communication.
Agent: So for one asset class, so for one type of asset, you have performance metrics that will tell you, okay, which one has been used, when it has been used, so that then you can, if the fallback asset is being used a lot, then you have the visibility over when it has been used and why it's used a lot, and you can then edit the different attributes so that it matches with more of the different banners that you uploaded.
Agent: Okay, perfect.
Agent: And I think it was, I hope I'm pronouncing the name okay, it is [PERSON-10] who's asked that question. But if there's a follow-up question, maybe pop that into the chat as well.
Agent: And then when [ORG-10] has said, is it possible to prioritize or filter multiple banners for customers based on attributes?
Speaker 5: Just to add a bit more context on that, so we have newsletters wherein we might do highlighting some of the offers that the customers are eligible for.
Speaker 5: It's possible that there might be 13 different offers, and a particular customer is only level for five of them, and you want to display them in a particular order as maybe cards in emails.
Speaker 5: Is it possible to do that filtering and prioritization based on the customer tools?
Agent: Yes, so for the filtering, it's possible because you can put exclusion rules or you can put must match values to make sure that a customer who is only eligible for certain offers will match with those attributes.
Agent: So that's possible. For [ORG-13], you don't have the possibility to decide in which order you will display the banners.
Agent: But what you can do is you can create attributes to try and influence the way the banners will be displayed.
Agent: So by adding for example, maybe a preference or this kind of fields so that it's taking into evaluation also in the decision.
Speaker 5: Okay, but it can handle multiple banners for sure.
Agent: Yes, and so the way the way it works is if I showed you a bit in more detail.
Agent: So If you look at all of your assets, so this is what we call the asset pool, then you will find all of the different banners, all of the different images that have been uploaded.
Agent: And then for each of the images, you will see the asset class. So that's where there, that's the pool of asset in which it's going to be a part of.
Agent: And then you will see if there's a fallback image for this asset, yes or no, is this asset still available?
Agent: Because also what happens is that, especially with offers and promotions, sometimes they are only valid for certain. range of time.
Agent: And so after a certain amount of time, you can program it so that it's automatically archive d and it's not displayed anymore to the customer after a specific date, for example . Then we can see the tags.
Agent: So the tags are the description of that email. So for example, the color, the type of component on the image, the font, the text, And then you have the different attributes that have been chosen.
Agent: So here I have three attributes. I have activity. So this, for example, the first image is more planning affinity people, the second one training, the third one hiking, and then you have the city.
Agent: So which city is actually this event in so that it's matched with the right customers.
Agent: And same with the language, if there's specific [PRODUCT-1] on the banner that is translated in different languages, then it needs to be displayed to the right customer.
Speaker 5: Okay.
Agent: And then I think [PERSON-13] just had one question [PERSON-13] might be easier if you just want to unmute maybe and ask is that okay.
Speaker 6: Yeah, sorry about that.
Agent: Okay, that works. So it was just a question about timing on [PRODUCT-7].
Agent: So
Agent: This one is specific to app, but I think also potentially maybe in some Cases maybe for email as well, I don't know, but time-based [PRODUCT-1] to say maybe if every time someone opens an app but say like [TIME-5] on a [DATE-10] to show that particular piece of [PRODUCT-1] within the app, I think that could be done more with basic rules more so than necessarily with machine learning though.
Agent: Am I right?
Agent: I'm okay.
Agent: Yes, exactly like I think if it's to display some [PRODUCT-1] within the app That's something that we can set up directly with the push notification builder Where we are able to we're able to program at what specific time we want the pop up to appear in the app and then using Personalization string we are able to adapt what Content is displayed depending on the user
Agent: Ok, so you would say at [TIME-6] on a [DATE-10], I know I want to push an in-app message. And like you said, your dynamic string would decide which of the pieces of [PRODUCT-1] to show in that message.
Agent: Exactly. Perfect.
Agent: Ok, hopefully that answers your question.
Agent: Okay, and so if I take an example with a specific email, so for example, here we can see that banner that is going to be different depending on which customer is actually opening the email depending on their city, on their language and on the activities that they are more, that they are preferred.
Agent: So if I switch to different customers, I can see that automatically, the banner is going to be different and it's speaking from the pool of assets that I've uploaded.
Agent: And it will automatically display something differen t for my different customers .
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Is this, this is using [ORG-13], right?
EndUser: For email dynamic emails.
Agent: So that's not using [ORG-13]. That's something that you can do. You can create a personalization using [ORG-13] script directly within your email.
EndUser: But it is using
Agent: Einstein Content selection. So it's already doing it for you. You don't need to Code it. It uses this interface and it does the matching automatically.
EndUser: And one other. Check, I see you have a litmus here. That's like native integrated.
EndUser: There is no, or is it add-on?
Agent: So it's both, it's natively integrated, but you have to have a litmus license to access the native integration.
EndUser: Do you have something similar as well?
EndUser: Like in box testing core is just, we have to use litmus.
Agent: You have to use litmus if you want to have a proper rendering solution and being emails that would be through litmus.
EndUser: Able to just say the different
Agent: Okay, and the second level of artificial intelligence that we can place in our [PRODUCT-1] is what we call [PERSON-13] Insights.
Agent: The goal of [ORG-16] is to help you test and learn how your different subject lines for your emails are performing.
Agent: And the idea here is very simple, is to have an idea of whether the subject line is performing as average, better than the average or below than the average in terms of engagement.
Agent: So is it helping you have email open, have clicks and have engagement?
Agent: The way you can use it is by analyzing automatically all of the different subject lines that you are going to create for your emails, analyze the performance, but you can also use our performance tester in order to test in advance how your different subject lines are performing.
Agent: And so, for example, here, if I create different version of that subject line, I'm going to create one with an emoji one without emoji. I'll launch a test. Sorry. And it will.
Agent: I think I put something. Let me put different version.
Agent: I'm sorry that I guess that's the issue of the live demo.
Agent: So automatically it will actually give you an idea of whether if that email is performing, if that specific [DATE-10] time is performing better, less than the average, so that then you can decide, okay, which one I need to place on my different emails.
Agent: Does it make sense for you?
EndUser: Yeah, definitely.
Agent: In the way it's going to, sorry.
Agent: The way it's going to analyze it is by using a mix of natural language processing, the history of all of the emails that you have sent, but also an anonymized database of all of the emails that have been sent globally on the Marketing platform.
Agent: So it's billions of emails that are building that algorithm in order to have an idea of what is working and what is not working.
Agent: And then you can evaluate depending on having an exclamation mark, having an emoji, how it's influencing the open, the emotional tone of the email, the words that are within that specific subject line.
Agent: For example, if I put that there's a free something, then it would perform 27, better than the average.
EndUser: I have a question here, actually two questions.
EndUser: The first one is how do you solve the new [ORG-16]?
EndUser: With [ORG-13] 13 issue with the emails because everything is rendered to proxy. So basically you have open rates jump up. And the second thing is we can see this like contest. Content clustering on a broader level.
EndUser: So if I want to look into what overall is great performing for specific segment, I can drill down into that. So for example, this segment has this is like top three type of [PRODUCT-1] or top five content.
EndUser: There is like top referring phrase or whatever. It is like, yeah. OK.
Agent: Yeah, for [DATE-13]. So actually all of the metrics within the Marketing Cloud platform have been adapted and all of the models have been adapted in order to take it to account the actual engagements. So the clicks.
Agent: In a way more heavy way than the opens. So all of the models have been already with the [DATE-13] release have been modified so that the engagement is taking over just open rate.
Agent: As we know that most of the open rates are going to be not relevant anymore, especially on the [ORG-16] platform.
EndUser: Yeah, because that's where I was wondering, optimization or subject line is going to be a bit. But this is screwed to the iOS, which for us is a big chunk.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Yes, so what is still going to work is the analysis of the sentence and then in order to have an idea of the performance, it's not just going to be based on open, it's going to mostly be based on actual clicks and engagement on that email.
Agent: And that's why the goal for, I mean, obviously you're aware of that, but the goal of marketers now is to try and put as many call to action or attractive messages within the email to create.
Agent: Create an engagement, because without that engagement you can't be [PERCENT-2] sure that email was actually open .
Agent: Okay, I think we are almost or it's time if you still have [TIME-7]. I'll I'll show you very quickly how you're going to be able to orchestrate then all of this Content with our journey tool.
Agent: So the idea here of [ORG-8] is to be able to create engagement programs using multiple channels and multiple data source to be able to really customize the experience for each of the different, each of the different clients.
Agent: So typically here, the first thing I would do is to decide, okay, who is going to enter in my welcome program.
Agent: So for example, all of the new people who just downloaded the app or all of the people who just created an account.
Agent: Once I decided who I inject in my journey, then I'm going to be able to decide how do I want to engage with that specific customer.
Agent: And this is where I'm going to be able to see all of my different channels.
Agent: So I have the email, the SMS, the [ORG-14], and all of the communication in-app, so which is the main communication source for you, will be push-notification, the inbox or the in-app messages, which would be those pop-ups that would appear when I'm on a specific page on the app.
Agent: I also have the possibility to connect with my social media platform so that automatically I can retarget a specific customer with banners, ads, Content on social media.
Agent: So for example on [ORG-14], on [PERSON-16], on [ORG-21], making sure that I'm really giving this multi-channel experience for my customer. Next step is building the actual logic of the program and adding another level of artificial intelligence.
Agent: Typically, this is where we could find that [PERSON-4]'s 10-time optimization, that we talked at the beginning of the meeting, that will help make sure that we are sending the right email at the best time for each of the customers.
Agent: We also have our frequency split that will automatically analyze how much emails, how much communications we are sending to each of our customers, and then will help us identify whether they are saturated with Marketing communications or whether they are receiving the right amount or not enough Marketing communication.
Agent: Depending on these levels, we'll be able to then adjust how much more communications we're sending to the different profiles.
Agent: And with the scoring split, we're going to be able to see how engaged they are with [ORG-17] that we are sending them.
Agent: So are they opening the emails?
Agent: Are they kicking on the content?
Agent: And after that, are they going on to the app, spending some time either browsing or actually converting and placing an order?
Agent: The idea, again, is to create different branches, different personas, so that we can address each profile in a custom way.
Agent: Do you have any questions on this?
EndUser: I just have one question. Because we are, at least in terms of a channel, we want to integrate our own channel within the app, basically specific screen on the page reserved for, let's say communication truth theorem.
EndUser: Do you have something like that like that we can create with to API or service?
Agent: So would it be to have some blocks on your app that would be customized
EndUser: Depending on exactly what Content blocks.
Agent: Content blocks. Yes, so, [PERSON-1], I don't know if you want to take that point.
Agent: So in [GPE-5], can you just phrase the question for me again?
Agent: Because you were saying you wanted it to be an Integration into CRM to create these blocks?
Agent: Or did I miss you?
EndUser: No, not create. I want to pass the audience. So basically, I want to add this within the journey step. So. Basically, as of my material, I want to create on a general journey to the customer.
EndUser: If I serve you a [PRODUCT-1] on food to push or email, once you land on the food, I want to show you again a [PRODUCT-1] on the specific tile.
Agent: Okay, okay, so you will you will have already created this empty Content area within the app and you just want us to inject the same piece that would have been seen in the email or the same piece in some other way or through the push
EndUser: That would have been seen up. Yeah, basically some type of way of communicating with the app.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, it sounds possible. I haven't seen it done before. So I would probably have to confirm that one with someone on the product team seems pretty possible.
Agent: And we can definitely influence Content areas with things like the product recommendations and things like that, but making it link to a message they've already seen before and having that bridge between the two I'd have to [PERCENT-2] confirm for it.
EndUser: Okay. Basically. What we want is to self force serve payload to the app. Right, this is what we want.
EndUser: And this payload care, you know, it should go like this is the, this is the person that you see it, this is the [PRODUCT-1] that you see it.
EndUser: This is the, you know, like copy and artwork, for example, or in first case, just the audience, but essentially something like this, because this is for us also a channel.
Agent: Yeah, no, that makes sense. That makes sense. Like I said, I believe it would be possible, but if you I would prefer to be [PERCENT-2] sure. Yeah.
EndUser: So
Agent: I leave that one with me and I'll confirm that one for you. Okay.
Agent: Any other questions there at Anything more you want all guys or anything?
Speaker 5: To be into?
Speaker 5: And I'm very hesitantly asking my last question. So one of the like.
Speaker 5: The challenges that we face with the, those on the [PRODUCT-5] tools that we've been using is the number of ways you can segment a customer base, right?
Speaker 5: So for example, let's say you want to target only customers who have had dominant number of orders on food. So they're dominant food users, but not dominant ideal users.
Speaker 5: And maybe looking at customers who have had one order at least in [DATE-16] [DATE-16]. So these sort of different filters, which kind of gives more flexibility of selecting a particular customer segment.
Speaker 5: It will be great to understand what are the lever s that sales was provided I know that it might not be enough time to cover that but if you have it in some sort of material or maybe you can look at it in a further discussion that will really help .
Agent: Yeah, so I mean, we definitely can like really, really deeply segment, but I'm just not sure if we really have time to go into the segmentation field or just now just I'm seeing that we're kind of [TIME-8] over time at the moment, but we could do another session just on segmentation, just on how we filter into the different audiences.
Agent: And even if you wanted to before that session, we could ask you for a couple of specific examples of ones that you want, and we could show how we build those exact examples for you as well. Okay.
Speaker 5: I like your perfect perfect.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: As I said guys apologies for running a little bit over time, No, no, and questions are great questions are great.
EndUser: But we had a lot of questions.
Agent: And I think like I said, the idea of [DATE-2]'s session was just to hopefully give you enough of a sort of a feel and a taster for how the [PRODUCT-4] layer touches of the Marketing platform.
EndUser: All the different areas
Agent: Hopefully in line with what we covered on our last call, but also just give you food for thought.
Agent: Then from there, you can decide if you do want to drill deeper into different areas, if there's more technical under the hood conversations that we need to have with individual teams or individual people, we can of course arrange that as well.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah. Thank you guys for sharing this. It's really insightful. What we really would want. I know.
EndUser: Because some of the team members were not here [DATE-2] to get this overview to them So we can kind of go over it because there been a lot of information and a lot of useful pieces that I think we need to kind of sit on and Analyze a bit and understand what is there so we can kind of yeah I want to take this with the team and discuss because there have been some great features that we see and And some really useful specifically, the [PRODUCT-1] piece, that's really a
EndUser: Robust solution that you have.
EndUser: The only thing I'm worried about, again, but when I look at me, I wonder what is the cost of such a service?
EndUser: And I know this is a separate one. And if this is also can be connected to a different solution, or it has to come with the part of a Marketing cloud.
EndUser: Because I'm always thinking about the cost because I'm a fierce experience.
Agent: Let's do this book. Let's make sure first that this is the right solution for you and solution you guys are looking for.
EndUser: Make sure that this is the
Agent: And then let's leave the costing and the commercials as like a last step because like this is like who you'll be able to like share with you any commercials first off validate this is the right thing for you.
EndUser: Now. But let's
Agent: How we're gonna implement it, how to be integrated with your systems, what kind of other systems you want to connect to it, and make sure that everything is covered, [PERCENT-2] good to go, and then we can take it to the commercial piece after.
EndUser: Okay, so in terms of like timeline, so we can get kind of a, because I want to wrap my head around, okay, because what solutions I already know and this new solution that you already went through [DATE-2].
EndUser: So we can kind of put the robust feature that we would ideally want.
EndUser: And then to, you know, see how do we go about implementation, What is the effort coming from you?
EndUser: What is the effort coming from the supporting teams as to the external agencies?
EndUser: And then we can understand the cost and then we can think if we cannot afford it, where do we go from there, right?
EndUser: This is what I want to understand actually.
Agent: Yeah, exactly. So here's the thing. What I would recommend that first of let us share with you the recording, use it with the team internally, walk them through that.
Agent: If you have any questions, we can have another session for the questions to deep drive in the points that we have discussed [DATE-2] and make sure that this is covered.
Agent: Once we have discovered, we can start, you know, like discussing the next steps, which is will be okay.
Agent: How we're going to implement the solution?
Agent: With what systems we need to integrate with, And then we can introduce you to a couple of partners.
Agent: We know already that there is a partner working on the [PRODUCT-5] piece, but like we need to check if they have the certifications that help them to, you know, to implement such a solution.
Agent: So then we introduce you to a couple of different partners.
Agent: You understand from them, like how they are going to get the job done, what is the timeline and everything?
Agent: And then like we take it to the next step. So let's take it step by step. First off, the most important piece for us is to make sure that we are positioning the right solution.
Agent: Then how we're going to implement this and then how we're going to make it happen for you guys financially.
EndUser: Okay, cool. Yeah, I just want to visualize, you know, like we could go pretty fast with the steps from our standpoint.
EndUser: Okay, you know, so I just want to make sure that like, we, some specific set of time that we can go through it even like faster from our side, because if we do need to make some decisions and changes, this has to happen soon, you know, because this is a robust shift.
EndUser: And the biggest issues, engineering effort, platform cost.
EndUser: Yeah, so yeah, that's the biggest thing I'm worried about to understand like what is the real cause I've seen before when I'm working on implementing the software, she took a bit of time, but I think we can go definitely go faster.
EndUser: Then what I've seen before. And yeah, I just want to understand that piece as well. Sure.
Agent: See how long it will take to implement it will depends on like the Implementation partner capacity Okay, and also the resources looking for the project.
EndUser: That you guys are it's very Yeah, it's a collection.
Agent: So
EndUser: I just need to know like, you know What could be the effort required because then our team needs to assess and then scope it see how many people we
Agent: Need to Here's the thing. Let's do this. OK. Let's schedule a quick feedback session with you and the team if you would like to invite anyone from the team who did enjoy it before. Please do so.
Agent: First off, share it with them, the Recording from [DATE-2], like me, the attorney with the team. And then we can go over this feedback session.
Agent: We make sure that we cover anything, any questions that might have not been answered that you guys have.
EndUser: Or any new questions
Agent: And then agree what would be the next step look like.
EndUser: Okay, shall
Agent: We start introducing partners need another deep dive session
EndUser: And take it. Perfect. Okay, feel
Agent: I will send you some options for [DATE-13]. Okay. When which one will work the best for you and the rest of the team and then we can go over access. Right.
EndUser: Perfect. Deal.
Agent: Thank you so much for your time.
Speaker 7: What can the rest of the team we
Agent: Know that we took like almost for time and extra but really appreciate this interactive session. It's really nice.
EndUser: Bye bye.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"1. Cost of the service: The customer expressed concern about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the financial implications before proceeding further.
2. Integration and implementation: The customer was interested in knowing the timeline, effort, and resources required for implementing the solution and integrating it with their existing systems. They also wanted to know how the new solution would work alongside their existing solutions.
3. Segmentation and filtering: The customer wanted to understand the capabilities of the product in terms of segmenting and filtering their customer base, specifically in targeting customers who have had a dominant number of orders on food but not on rides.
4. Personalization and customization: The customer was interested in understanding how the product could help them personalize and customize their communications across different channels, including their own in-app channel.

It is important to note that the customer had several questions and concerns, and these were some of the main ones that were discussed during the call.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question about how the AI decides, learns about customer preference communication and channel, like time of day, and can it be tailored for specific services or groups to be one (timestamp 00:22:15). The customer showed interest and asked a follow-up question, indicating engagement.
2. Question about the local customization and the level of parameters that can be adjusted (timestamp 00:26:30). The customer asked for more details, showing engagement.
3. Question about how the personalization works, specifically how to define the criteria of campaign success and optimize it (timestamp 00:34:15). The customer asked for a demo interface to play around with and get more specific in their questions, indicating engagement.

These questions seemed to engage the customer more based on their follow-up questions and requests for more information.",Where were some opportunities where the sales rep could have done a better job articulating the value proposition of our company or product?,"1. At the beginning of the call, the sales rep mentioned that the company, ORG-1, is a platform that allows for the building of different communication strategies across various business areas. However, they did not explicitly mention how this platform can benefit the customer's organization or improve their customer experience.

2. When discussing the Marketing area of the Salesforce Customer 360 platform, the sales rep listed various artificial intelligence functionalities, but did not clearly connect them to the customer's specific needs or pain points.

3. During the demo component, the sales rep showcased various features such as personalization recipes and personalization decisions, but could have better explained how these features would directly impact the customer's business objectives and KPIs.

4. The sales rep mentioned the ability to define criteria for campaign success and optimize accordingly, but did not provide concrete examples of how this could be done or how it would benefit the customer.

5. When discussing the cost of the service, the sales rep suggested focusing on validating the solution first and then addressing cost later. While this approach can be useful in some cases, it might have been more beneficial to provide at least a general idea of the pricing structure to help the customer understand the financial implications of implementing the solution.

In general, the sales rep could have done a better job of connecting the features and capabilities of the product to the customer's specific needs and goals. By providing more concrete examples and use cases, the sales rep could have more effectively demonstrated the value of the product and how it can positively impact the customer's business.",What was the customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call?,"The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was positive. They found the presentation insightful and saw great features in the seller's product. However, they expressed concern about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the implementation effort, timeline, and financial aspects before making a decision. They agreed to have a feedback session with the seller's team to discuss any unanswered questions and agree on the next steps.","Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?","Answer: It is unclear from the transcript if the right decision maker was present on the call. The sales representative mentions the need to share the recording and information with the customer's team, which suggests that more than one person would be involved in the decision-making process. However, no specific decision maker is mentioned by name.

As for the agreed-upon next steps, the sales representative suggests scheduling a feedback session with the customer and their team to answer any remaining questions and discuss the next steps. The sales representative also mentions introducing the customer to partners for implementation and discussing the financial aspects of the deal. However, specific dates or timelines for these next steps are not mentioned in the transcript.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"The sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs and demonstrating the capabilities of their product. However, there are a few areas where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's needs:

1. The sales rep could have asked more questions about the customer's use case for the product, such as the specific types of content they plan to create and how they will measure the success of their campaigns. This would have allowed the sales rep to tailor the demo to the customer's needs and provide more specific examples of how the product can help the customer achieve their goals.
2. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's current marketing technology stack and how they plan to integrate the new product with their existing tools. This would have helped the sales rep understand the customer's technical requirements and provide recommendations for how to best implement the product.
3. The sales rep could have asked about the customer's budget and timeline for implementing the new product. This would have allowed the sales rep to provide more accurate pricing information and set realistic expectations for the implementation process.

Overall, the sales rep did a good job of understanding the customer's needs, but could have benefited from asking more targeted questions to gather more specific information about the customer's use case, technical requirements, and budget.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the seller's product's personalization features, specifically the real-time personalized recommendations based on behavior tracking and affinity modeling. They also showed interest in the contextual bandit algorithm used for offer optimization, which balances customer and business value. The customer mentioned that these features align well with their use case of optimizing the right time for specific services. They also appreciated the robust solution for managing and organizing content into a searchable library.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer seemed to be interested in the seller's product and found many features useful for their needs. However, they also expressed concerns about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the implementation process, timeline, and associated efforts. They requested a follow-up meeting to discuss these concerns and ask further questions. Therefore, while the customer is positively inclined towards the product, they have not yet made a definitive decision about whether the product fully meets their needs.",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"Yes, the sales rep asked open-ended questions to identify customer intent. Here are some examples:

1. ""But I wanted to kind of drill into a couple of areas that based on our conversation, the last time we really think will be beneficial for [PERSON-6] and will help you kind of move forward and increase your customer engagement.""
2. ""So the first one is personalization recipes. So this is basically making sure that we are recommending the best product, the best content, the best categories of restaurants, of food that people can go ahead and engage with.""
3. ""I just have a question more. How does AI decide, learns about customer, preference communication and channel, like time of [DATE-5], can I be tailored specific service or group to be one and like, what is the basic flexibility of adjusting the model?""
4. ""So you have the ability to engineer to feature engineer the algorithm that runs those personalization decisions for next best off for next best action.""
5. ""So, like I said, there are There is the ability for you to engineer to feature engineer the algorithm that runs those personalization decisions for next best off for next best action.""

24. ""So, like I said, there",What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?,"1. Cost of the service: The customer expressed concern about the cost of the service and wanted to understand the financial aspect before committing to the solution.
2. Integration and implementation timeline: The customer was interested in knowing the timeline for implementation and the resources required from both their side and the implementation partner. They wanted to assess the engineering effort and platform cost to ensure it fits into their plans.
3. Segmentation capabilities: The customer inquired about the segmentation features and how they can filter customers based on specific criteria, such as order frequency and product preferences. They requested a separate session to discuss segmentation in detail.

Answer to this question is clear."
video_19793_167_6qr3y000000odhiAAA,"Agent: So it's recording. So it's another question. So yeah, I was saying, please feel free to interact and engage if you have any question. We have like [TIME-1] left, more or less.
Agent: So [PERSON-1] will do [TIME-2] of demo and then we'll hand it over to the [ORG-1] team. So [PERSON-1], I'll let you start. Perfect.
Agent: Thank you [PERSON-2] and thank you team. So like [PERSON-2] said, we're going to go through the demo before starting. I just wanted to reiterate what we've heard from you so far.
Agent: Obviously, we've had several conversations with [PERSON-3] and [GPE-1] over [DATE-1] I want to say now. And we read your requirements and the white paper that you shared.
Agent: So I just wanted to summarize what we understood from you because from understanding it's going to be the ace of the demo .
Agent: So, starting off was we need [QUANTITY-1] view as single source of truth of the member profile.
Agent: So, all the data that we've captured of the members, whether they are [ORG-2], [ORG-3], we want to have in one system, we don't want to find data in different places, and the profile needs to have structured and unstructured data.
Agent: Following that is how can we better communicate with the members?
Agent: They need to have access to what we have defined a member portal to improve the communication between the members and the [ORG-4], especially for the members department. So that is something that we're also going to see.
Agent: What the experience of the members is going to be like. All of this is going to be translated into a better and improved member in athlete experience and service.
Agent: If our members or athletes log into their portal and they have, they have a way, they need to communicate with us in some type of way, we need to enable them, first of all, to self-serve, but also to communicate with us.
Agent: So that communication is going to be translated into what we call insults first terms a case, they will then be routed to the appropriate teams .
Agent: Why are we doing this?
Agent: This is because we want to digitize the way that we do things currently at the [ORG-4] for the members department and we want to move away from traditional email-based processes.
Agent: So also we're going to see how we can implement and automate some of the Workflow processes within the system. And this is obviously, this is all why we're doing this. We want to automate.
Agent: So the keyword is going to be automating the processes. I'm gonna pause you for just a moment.
Agent: Are we on the Is that what you, did we understand you correctly?
Speaker 4: Same page, everybody?
Agent: Yes. Absolutely. Great, love it. So all of the everything that you are looking at the screen is going to be translated into the demo that we have prepared to you for you [DATE-2]. So.
Agent: Obviously, we are in the [EVENT-1] and Paralympic movement, but we wanted to put a tech gist into the story that we're going to tell [DATE-2]. So let's see how can we move away from tech barriers with [ORG-5].
Agent: At [ORG-5], we love to tell stories. I don't normally love to show you feature and function. So what [ORG-5] can do, obviously, we're going to go and I'm going to highlight you.
Agent: What are the benefits of the value that you will get from it?
Agent: But I wanted to frame it in a story way. So we're going to see the experience [DATE-3] of two completely fictitious characters, one from an internal. perspective.
Agent: So from the [ORG-4], we're going to be looking at the experience of [PERSON-4] using [WORK_OF_ART-1] e as a membership manager internally at the [ORG-4]. And also we're going to be looking at an externa l user.
Agent: So somebody that works at the [ORG-6], obviously I'm [NORP-1].
Agent: So I wanted to use an [NORP-1] [ORG-6] [ORG-7], and [PERSON-5] in this case is going to be the person tha t wants to apply to a grant that the [ORG-4] provides to the different [ORG-8] s. So, let's jump into the journey.
Agent: So I'm going to highlight now on this next screen all the points and all the experience that we're going to be looking at. So first of all, we're going to start with [PERSON-4].
Agent: She starts her day in [ORG-5] and we're going to see what she does and what are the information that she has access to when she logs into [ORG-5].
Agent: We're going to see how she can look at the different grants that the [ORG-4] provides, what is the status of the grants, what kind of programs are related to this grant.
Agent: And then we're going to move over to the external user, so it is a [PERSON-6] that works at [ORG-7] and finds out about an [ORG-4] grant that she wants to apply to.
Agent: So right here, she's going to have access to a grantee or a member portal where she can apply to grants, she can self-service, she can communicate with us internally at [ORG-9], so we'll see her experience as well.
Agent: Moving over to, she can then apply to a new application that will be fired off from the portal.
Agent: And then how can we at the [ORG-4] receive this application?
Agent: So again, moving away from email-based communication, we can see how all of this is then being captured in the single source of truth of the member profile.
Agent: So all of the information that we captured around our members are going to be stored in [ORG-5].
Agent: How can we communicate better with our members?
Agent: I'm going to show you two different options that you have with [ORG-5]. It doesn't mean that you have to choose just one.
Agent: You can use the sky's limits and you can decide and your department will actually decide what way they want to communicate with your members, what channels, what way. So I'm going to show you that.
Agent: Then I'm going to go through a very high touch process. Because obviously, I don't fully know how the grant process at the [ORG-4] works.
Agent: So I'm going to show you what those first can do, but it could be [PERCENT-1] adaptable to your processes. We can see how then the grant is being awarded to [ORG-7].
Agent: I'm giving it out like that. Obviously, it's going to be awarded. And then we're going to see what is going to happen to the post award.
Agent: What is the type of communication?
Agent: What is the type of experience that we want to give our members and attorneys?
Agent: So this is just a summary of what of the story that it's going to be about.
Agent: Any questions so far?
Agent: And obviously, team, I'd love to keep it interactive. If you have questions, I see you. So raise your hand. Just come off mute.
Speaker 4: Do whatever you feel.
Agent: I think you have no questions so far. We're so weird. Great. excited on how this would work. Perfect. Sounds good. Sounds good. So let me introduce again to [PERSON-4], who manages all the membership relationship BI PC.
Agent: Obviously, we have somebody in the call that fits within this role. Let's see how her experience now looks like in [ORG-5].
Agent: How are you day looks like in [ORG-5]?
Agent: So. [PERSON-4] logs into [ORG-5] and this is pretty much a potential view of what she could view what her day could look like. She logs in and she has access to a home page.
Agent: This home page is completely customizable to the needs that [PERSON-4] has in comparison to her role. She manages all the membership relationship so she wants to have those KPIs right when she logs into [ORG-5].
Agent: We love sayings are not worth it . She wants to maybe have this ability to over the grants and the application that she has received [DATE-2].
Agent: How many people are we helping?
Agent: How many are word disbursements, how we had along [DATE-4]?
Agent: This is again just an example of what could be visible for [PERSON-4] as somebody that manages the relationships and the members with the different members. The dashboard is made up of illustrative
Agent: Way of short reports that we have. already created within [ORG-5]. It can be completely customizable to whatever means that [GPE-2] has. What I also had in here are the different [ORG-8] grants.
Agent: So this is something that [ORG-5] has within the system. You don't have to create new and different objects with [ORG-5]. You already have the object that defines the grants, for example.
Agent: What we also have is something that we call the task management. Obviously, when I log into [ORG-5], I don't want to go through my agenda. I want to have the system that tells me what to do.
Agent: Maybe I have tasks that have been assigned to me. Again, we have the automation in place because they could be automatically assigned if a process is fired up in the background.
Agent: I have a task right here that tells me to check on the application process. process for a specific member .
Agent: What I also have because with [ORG-5], I have the ability to log and connect either my Outlook calendar or my [ORG-10] calendar, I have all of the events, all the meetings already in [ORG-5].
Agent: So that I know I don't have to go through a different screen. When I log into [ORG-5], I know that at [TIME-3] I have a [ORG-5] demo and I have to block my agenda.
Agent: So again, team, this is completely customizable view. It's my idea of what I think that the somebody that works in the membership department idea you see would need.
Agent: But again, obviously we can sit down and... change this, whatever, however you want, you can change the logo, you can change the colors, literally anything that you're looking at can be changed and customizable to your.
Speaker 4: As long as I think that the criteria is and the [ORG-8] is defined, exactly that from our end as well that needs to be defined what we want to measure and.
Agent: Right?
Agent: So
Speaker 4: I guess you're not linking them to what specific data is linked to all of them.
Agent: Exactly, exactly. Yes. And it depends like it could be data that you have with instance-first data that communicate to [ORG-5]. So you may be bringing this data outside from external sources into [ORG-5].
Agent: You can create reports in dashboard, obviously with the KPIs that you have defined. And that could be defined according to the person that logs in.
Agent: So maybe somebody- In another department doesn't need to look or have visibility over membership data or applications or grants And that person, because it's not in the membership department, will not have visibility over that .
Agent: So we can have the flexibility of who sees what.
Speaker 4: Just to build on that last point, because that was actually a question on who sees what, from the membership departments, we have colleagues dealing with the branch Engagement is more about the relation, so the governance issues, cases, questions, institutional matters that arise.
Agent: Specifically.
Speaker 4: And this will be definitely different than We live in membership First of all, as far as from what I understand, we can change it as we can.
Agent: Team. Absolutely.
Agent: Absolutely [PERCENT-1] we can be so flexible we can go so deep into the little fields the fields could be like the general population like all the little wording that you see we can be as flexible and as peculiar as you would like to decide that person sees that field that person does not have to see that field so if we're talking about different departments and what they do we can [PERCENT-1] customize the their experience with that
Speaker 4: In mind Last question is that in the back end or can the user do that as well ?
Agent: Great question. So what we suggest obviously if you on board [ORG-5] you're going to have one or more admins. So there is an administrator that would usually it sits within the IT department.
Agent: You can have somebody that you can have the admin to do that or if you as somebody internal as a user, you are.
Agent: Assigned those rights to change the different fields and the visibility, you can do that Obviously, this depends on the experience that the [ORG-4] wants to provide to the differen t users So [ORG-15] has that flexibility, so it really depends on what you would like .
Agent: For something more, you know, that would sit more in the back end, we would probably suggest that there is an admin that defines those rights because we don't want somebody, for example, a membership manager, for example, to delete.
Agent: [PERSON-7] to be able to delete fields by mistake, for example. So we would like to maybe lower that risk by not giving that person delete to access. I'm just, you know, making it, making this up.
Agent: So it really depends, but you can, if you assigned, you can [PERCENT-1] do that right.
Speaker 4: Want to have those rights
Agent: Thanks. Great.
Speaker 5: Perfect. If I may, sure, sure. [PERSON-8] before. So I guess, you already talked about integration of different data sources to visualizations that we see here in the mock-up as well.
Agent: That [PERSON-9] leads
Speaker 5: But then maybe you're going to go into this now as well, but one of my questions is around Workflow application. So my team here in the background also was thinking about what about signatures.
Speaker 5: Because especially when it comes to grants as an example, there's a lot of documents that are being exchanged. So approvals that need to be done internal, but then also moving outside to the client and back.
Speaker 5: So, you know, signature is something that we're interested in, but more or less document exchange. As well, for example, some of the grant programs that we have audit right components in there.
Speaker 5: So as we give out monies, we need to make sure from a [NORP-2] perspective, especially, that the funds that we provide to external third-party organizations are used in a certain way.
Speaker 5: And so there's always this back and forth of applying for a grant. reviewing a budget approving that, then reporting back actuals, requesting documents for proof.
Agent: So it's something, yeah, and I would call a workflow, I guess. And yeah, would like to see how that works. Absolutely.
Speaker 4: I'm [PERCENT-1] going to go through all of that. So in [TIME-4], so we're going to go through it. But thank you for the question I know I support. Sorry [PERSON-1], just a quick question.
Speaker 4: I know that it's going to be customizable and everything can be changed. But by this slide, if we consider the process, the process mapping process,
Agent: Is this the membership profile?
Agent: Is this an example of membership profile?
Speaker 4: My membership
Agent: Profile, you need somebody internal that works Sorry, as a member.
Speaker 4: That manages membership. Yeah. Yeah. So my idea, yes, exactly. So it could be something like that. Because the way that, for example, we as the membership department, once I know it's customers, I just want to make it clear.
Speaker 4: For example, for us, when we say, I think, way of truth is that for example we see NPCs so for example [ORG-8] [GPE-3] all the data from [ORG-15] comes there but you do have one section and the grand has well.
Speaker 4: But, absolutely. Each member, let's say from high F, you have all the information coming from one
Agent: Single source which we call it profile. So this will be that profile. No, this is not a profile. So I'm just showing the experience of the member of somebody that manages the members internally at the [ORG-4].
Agent: We didn't go into the single source of truth of a member, but I'm going to, in [TIME-4], I'm just to show you what are the different functionality that you can have within [ORG-5].
Agent: So this is just the first page that I could look at with all the information, but I didn't go into the details.
Agent: Of let me have a look at the [NORP-1] as a member and wha t they look like but I'm going to in [TIME-5].
Speaker 4: [ORG-10]
Agent: Thank you . Yes, no, thank you for the questions. So before going into the members profile, I want to show you what are the different grants that I have already in [ORG-5].
Agent: In [ORG-5] term, what we defined as grants are called funding opportunities. Again, like I said, anything that you're looking at can be completely changed and customizable to your jargon, to your wording, into your needs.
Agent: What I also had created because the [ORG-4] obviously disbursed this different grant.
Agent: I have created a list of all the funding opportunities But I also created one for, for example, the athlete grants I created one for the only [ORG-13] grants, for example which is going to be the one that we're gonna focus on toda y and the one for the [ORG-13] grants So I have the possibility, thanks to the filters right here to filter and create different list s of the different grants that the [ORG-13] disperses .
Agent: If I go into the [ORG-8] grant and again team completely made up, name is something that I looked at. I think I saw an article around this grant.
Agent: For the organizational developing grant, I want to show you what is again that single source of truth of a grant.
Agent: What are all the information that I want to capture around this grant?
Agent: I know that this grant right now is being appointed up at the top right here. I have what I call a past. A path shows me where I'm standing and what is the status of this application.
Agent: Has it been launched?
Agent: Are my receiving submissions?
Agent: Are the applications coming in?
Agent: Are we under the evaluation process?
Agent: This path and all this wording that you see is completely customizable. I made this completely up to what I thought could be different status of a grant process.
Agent: The details, the details doesn't need any explanations are what are the details around this grant and who are we helping?
Agent: Is it what are the eligibility criteria?
Agent: What are the applications instructions that we can define right here?
Agent: This information if we decide to can be surfaced externally to a member's portal and we're going to have a look how that looks like.
Agent: All the applications that I receive before this grant are going to be under the stop, under the application tab. I like emojis, so I added the emojis here. If you don't like it, you don't have to add them.
Agent: This was just my take. The applications that I received are going to be stored here. Any document checklist items, what the [ORG-6] have to provide in order for me to decide.
Agent: Are they in the standing?
Agent: Can I have... awarded this grant to the [ORG-8]. I'm obviously oversimplifying the process, but I want t o show you what is possible.
Agent: So maybe what needs to be done is that the [ORG-8] has to tell me or ha s to send me some type of documents that will say that they are in good standing and I also need t o have financial review of the [ORG-8] .
Agent: Again completely customizable.
Agent: Any awards, have we awarded this grant to an [ORG-8] for example?
Agent: They are going to be showed up here. We can see and I'm going to go into details of what that looks like.
Agent: The analysis, so any report and data that we can pull from the information that we have can be stored here. I can just add because all these pages drag and drop components, there is absolutely no coding required.
Agent: So if I want to add a report that I created, it's going to be showed up here.
Agent: And again, this is an example of what I have here, is the population served for the specific application, which might not necessarily apply to the [ORG-8] world.
Agent: And then where do we store all the files?
Agent: So again, because we need to have structured infrastructure data, you have the possibility to also add files to the specific grant.
Agent: Now, we had a look at what is internally at the [ORG-4], what is their experience without having yet to receive the application.
Agent: I want to show you now, and I'm going quickly, team, because I think I have [TIME-6]. So, but if you have questions, please interrupt me.
Agent: I want to show you also the experience of a grant manager externally that the site. to apply to the grant. So I want to show you their member profile.
Agent: So [PERSON-5] i n this case that works at [ORG-7] thanks to the recen t communication she finds out about an [ORG-4] grant that she wants to apply to.
Agent: S o let's have a look at her experience.
Agent: She is presented with a login screen wher e she can log in and she can create an externa l user profil e. whether we will address and password or she can obviously, if we enable this in turn of the [ORG-18], she can then login and apply and get access to the member's portal with login via [ORG-25], [ORG-25], [ORG-25], whatever else our social media that she uses, we can enable that single sign-on experience as well.
Agent: So this will be the login screen of somebody of a member down one step access to a member portal . When she logs in, this is what she will look like.
Agent: This is created within [ORG-5] and is what we call a member portal. She, let me just make it bigger so you can see what I have up here.
Agent: I have the homepage so that I can see all the information there is. There was absolutely no coding required. It's all drag and drag components to create the sport that we expose externally. We have what is one grant.
Agent: Maybe we want to have a look at the list of recipients of previous [ORG-4] developing grants. Maybe we want to look at a article on how to apply.
Agent: Customised to the [ORG-4] logo theme article and it's really that second layer o f information that you want to give to your members that have login rights . to a number portal.
Agent: Right here, not only can they have access to the grants, they can also self-serve in case they have questions. Maybe they have questions around an application process. Maybe they want to change their username.
Agent: Maybe they want to change their password. Anything that they want to do, we can have a safe place for them to do so.
Agent: Also, what is the kind of communication?
Agent: How can they communicate with us internally?
Agent: I created here is a contact support .
Agent: For?
Agent: Where anything or when they click submit, a case will be automatically created and routed to the exact team. Thanks to routing schemes that we have defined within [ORG-5]. They also have the opportunity to upload files.
Agent: So this is really to build the support of this really, we have to think about what is the kind of experience that we want to give our external users in this case, the members. Here we go.
Agent: I can also have a look of all my cases all the cases that I logged all the communications that I needed to know from the [ORG-4] And when I meet communications is more I'm not talking about newsletter communication I'm talking about I need help kind of thing It's what is the support that I need from the IP C that I can't solve myself .
Agent: If we want to enhance this and maybe have other channels, not only can we have right here a contact to support form where we communicate with [ORG-13], maybe you want to have something quick and easy.
Agent: I don't want to send an email, I don't want to call, but I want to chat with an agent at [ORG-13]. Right here, we can also enable bot.
Agent: So this is something that we can talk about for the future, but please know that you can. and enable different channels, different communication
Speaker 4: [ORG-25] to enhance the experience of your members . I got a question the update of member profile data.
Agent: On
Speaker 4: Is it possible to at least put the Workflow on it before it reflects, let's say I updated the Secretary General's name, it goes into like a review
Agent: Before it reflects process always, and then you should sign up from the membership. this is absolutely what should happen. So when a member logs in and maybe they change something internally, an approval process is actually fired up.
Agent: It's something that we have to enable in the background. It goes through the [ORG-4] and then we check because obviously we don't want because anything that happens profile will be reflected into [ORG-5].
Speaker 4: In the member's
Agent: This is the same thing. So obviously we want to keep the data consistent. and our approval process is [PERCENT-1] the way to go . Great question, [PERSON-3], thank you. Wonderful.
Agent: So we are here because [PERSON-5] wants to apply to a grant. So if I go into my funding opportunity, I have a look at all the funding opportunities that are visible to me.
Agent: The reason why I'm bringing this up is because I am [PERSON-5] and I work at an [ORG-8].
Agent: So maybe what we could enable is that somebody that works at the [ORG-8] would only be able to view, and this is an example, will only be able to view [ORG-8] graphs, for example.
Agent: And this will be defined things to the audiences that we can define within the portal. So you don't have to create 10,000 different portals, one for the athletes, one for the [ORG-2], one for the IFs.
Agent: You can have one portal but define different audiences and their experience will change according to the profile that of the personal log Z. So this is an idea.
Agent: I don't know if you want to go through that route but please know that this is also possible to improve the experience of your members.
Agent: So, it's a [PERSON-6] one-star apply to the [ORG-4] organization, develop a grant, which is the one that we showed before. Here, we're surfacing the information that we have shared before, that I showed you before in [DATE-5].
Agent: And we define what information will be shared in the portal. If there is something that we don't want to show, we hide it [PERCENT-1] we have complete flexibility or what is available to our members externally.
Agent: Right here and again, this is what [PERSON-8] was saying before was, okay, let's think about a Workflow process that we want to enable.
Agent: Right here, for example, I don't want [PERSON-5] to email me her application about sending me all the files and all the documents that I asked her for.
Agent: What I had it here is what we call in [ORG-5] term after. too low. This is a button that we can surface and can be completely customizable. This is somethin g that I created .
Agent: And right here when there's a mele clicks on the apply for this opportunity is going to fire a form of the information that I'm asking her to.
Agent: Maybe she needs to send me a financial report and maybe she has to send me some kind of information.
Agent: She has to tell me, how are you going to use this money for?
Agent: What is the budget?
Agent: That you're going to allocate to this project. All of this could be created in this form that is going to be fired from a button.
Agent: I want to show you, since we have some IT members in the team, I want to show you how this process in the backend looks like. This is a flow in [ORG-5] terms.
Agent: We can define some categories of who is this person.
Agent: Do we know is this somebody that is open?
Agent: To our member portal or is it somebody that is no t authenticated so we might know information about this person . So we can have different paths and define the criteria that this person falls into.
Agent: Since we know it's a better lab, we have created a, I call it an eligibility quiz, team, this is completely made up. Obviously, you can have it as rich as you would like.
Agent: We can define criteria, and we can thank you for your interest in this particular funding opportunity in this grant.
Agent: We can have... All sets of criteria that we define in this flow So this is what it's going to look like in the back end But then obviously, her experience is going to be extremely smooth because she doesn't have to call us She doesn't have to send us email All the information will be shared through the Member [ORG-25] .
Agent: Great. So she goes into apply and all the applications are going to be stored right here in the application tab.
Agent: If there has been any awards that she has at the [NORP-1] parliamentary committee has been awarded to, they are going to be stored here. This is just an example. We can surface more information that we want.
Agent: Any library content, any article that we want to put in the application tab. for our specific members, we can [PERCENT-1] do so This is obviously just an example I want to pause it right here for two .
Agent: [TIME-7] to see if there are any questions and what you think of the member's experience on
Speaker 4: The portal.
Speaker 5: I'd like
Agent: To ask you to go first and then.
Speaker 4: I have one as well. And if anything. Yeah, we don't have any questions from the room. And definitely there's a lot more opportunity again, expanding all of the services. Again, it will be based from how we define,
Agent: You know, expanding applications in the future. Absolutely,
Speaker 4: Yeah. This is obviously just an example.
Speaker 4: Probably a question, rather, two questions or details, but is the look in the field, is it all standardized for all members?
Speaker 4: So, whether it's an [ORG-8] IF, [ORG-8] if you remember why the information is easy for [GPE-4], we'll see the same.
Speaker 4: For example, the picture was that even do you have that flexibility to customize to that extent as well?
Speaker 4: But again, that's really detailed. We will look at the field that just came out.
Speaker 4: And the second question you mention there's a chat function?
Agent: Is, did
Speaker 4: Did I get that right?
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Speaker 4: So is that a chat function activity to go to individual people depending on who is chatting?
Speaker 4: So let's say I'm running from [ORG-8] member from [LOC-1], it is jobs that it is going to assign the
Agent: Asset manager or regional lead in our team. Right. Let me any other comments.
Agent: No, okay. So let me answer the first question. So the experience can [PERCENT-1] change according to the person that logs in. So we talked before around the different audiences.
Agent: So if you decide that you want to give a member in [LOC-2], for example, a completely different experience. The page needs to look different. The article needs to look different. You can [PERCENT-1] have that flexibility.
Agent: So you're not tied to one view. We've created one portal and it to be the same for everybody.
Agent: If this is not what you want, you can [PERCENT-1] have that [PERSON-10] y because it is embedded within the portal functionality and it's called audience The second question, so the chat functionality, can you rephrase the question?
Agent: So obviously this could be, you can decide to either surface the chat functionality , for, you know, it can be for a X amount of members or it can be for people that have this category.
Agent: So depending on the audience, once you have the chat, either you can have a chat button before routing it to the agent, or you can have, obviously, there is going to be an agent on the other side.
Agent: I'm calling it an agent. You might not call it this way.
Agent: You might have an agent that is a... for that specific theme and category, and they're gonna be able to apply, to reply, because here we have the routing as well defined as a workflow.
Agent: If it's somebody after membership, obviously
Speaker 4: That looks we don't want to route to the chat to somebody in another department that might not know what they talk about. You guys.
Speaker 4: So basically the option is one chat bot if we create the chat bot there so that there will be some certain questions there use or if every weekend actually have like service levels there let's say first will be chat bot and then do you want to talk about it then in the very big
Agent: That goes into like a live queue who will who will answer it or we can just totally disable to.
Speaker 4: It if we want
Agent: Absolutely, absolutely. You don't need to have it. This is an example.
Agent: You absolutely need to have a chat if you don't need to have a chat, but if it's not all you want, I just want to show you the possibilities. Yeah, [PERCENT-1].
Agent: Sure. Now, let's have a look at the members profile. This is what we're here for. And let's have a look at what's all the information that we've captured around our member as an [ORG-8], [ORG-7].
Agent: So what we're looking at, I'm now [PERSON-4] again. I work at the [ORG-4] and I'm logged into sales first. So I want to have visibility over [ORG-7] as an account as a member.
Agent: Some of the information that I added that were obviously not other the box, but I wante d to show you what is possible For example, do we know that this [ORG-8] is in good standing Yes, we do Obviously, this is not a field that fills first comes out of the box .
Agent: This is something that I created and it's extremely simple to create. You create it and you attach it to this page. All Dragon Drop components, absolutely no coding whatsoever, require, I have no idea how to code.
Agent: Any information that you want to surface up at the top of the information that I want to know more.
Agent: Are they in good standing?
Agent: Are they in ground to your organization?
Agent: What is the website?
Agent: What is the flag in the country that we are talking about?
Agent: I want to also show the membership status. So right here, I know that they're an active member. Obviously, if they were inactive, they will be flagged as inactive. And maybe the kind of information will be different.
Agent: Maybe they're suspended, maybe they're terminated. Obviously, this field can be completely customizable. This is something that I added.
Agent: Any details of the information?
Agent: What is the main contact?
Agent: This is an actual main contact at [ORG-7]. So I created [DATE-6], I know that this might be the person that I have a relationship with.
Agent: Maybe this is the person that I know the most internally at [ORG-7]. Example. Membership information already in the standing.
Agent: What is the membership type?
Agent: But this is a pick field that I created so that I know and I can this is great for reporting for creating lists.
Agent: So I know how many NPCs am I helping?
Agent: How many NPCs applications have I received anything like that?
Agent: This is something that I can that I can obviously customize. The address information that I have here. All of this can be completely customizable to whatever relationships.
Agent: Since we're talking about a relationship manager here when we're talking about membership I want to know who works at the [ORG-4] that I have a relationship with. So I have obviousl y our [PERSON-5], who is the grant manager.
Agent: I have [PERSON-8], who is the president, an d then I have [PERSON-15], who is my main contact to add the internationa l [ORG-25]. They are a link to two different relationships.
Agent: So I know she's the head of committee who is the grant officer and who is the president of [ORG-7]. So this also helps me to See who I need to contact with.
Agent: Any membership fees are there.
Agent: So right here, what are they paid their membership fee?
Agent: They're going to be stored in the membership profile.
Agent: What are the previous or future or applications that haven't been submitted or awarded yet?
Agent: They are going to be sure that up here. So for example, during COVID, they applied to a grant at the [ORG-8] and had us been approved and also awarded.
Agent: So we can see the link between an application and a word, right?
Agent: Here obviously I made some testing . I can have an application that I just recently submitted. And if there has been a word that has been granted, I can do that as well.
Agent: I just want to show the application record because obviously it's not what [PERSON-8] was saying. We have to involve other people. It's not just me and you that deal with a membership application.
Agent: There's going to be external approvals, internal approvals. So.
Agent: And right here I can submit to the application for approval So this has been again, a Workflow automation that we have had it With a click of a button, I don't have to do anything else It's not that I have to call somebody in my team to apply for this, to review this application I can just fire this button and it's going to .
Agent: It's going to notify the person that has to review the application. All of this will be stored in the approval history so I can view whether or not what are the reviews and what has been the application recommendation.
Agent: Okay, this has been awarded.
Agent: What are the application decisions?
Agent: So this is going to be obviously many different people and keeping it extremely short for the time but this is really where you would have the difference the community.
Agent: With different teams and you can fire this through Workflow automation . All of this can be audited because I have an application history so I can know who's reviewed it, who's changed it.
Agent: If there's made any amendments, all of this will be tracked. So if there's been a mistake or maybe we have to go back a few steps previously, all of this will be stored in the history. Great.
Agent: If I go into the funding award, so let's assume a fast forward from now, we have awarded this grant to [ORG-7].
Agent: What can I do?
Agent: Within [ORG-5], I can create an award letter right here. So this is something that [PERSON-8] was mentioning before in terms of signature.
Agent: Right here, we can create a, this is obviously just an example of a letter that we can create within [ORG-5] if we need to add what's If we need to add e-signature, obviously we'll be looking at what we call [ORG-25] e of the vendors, the [ORG-25] that integrate with salesperson like [ORG-26] or [ORG-30] This is something that we can discuss Any budget that has been allocated So for example, our here K-10,000 dollars are going to be used for communication, material s and publications This is what [ORG-25] has told me to What are the disparities [DATE-7] So I'm looking at the finance department right here This is what we're doing where you would definitely look up and where you would [PERSON-15] If you want to, if we need to integrate your finance syst em or your accounting system with [WORK_OF_ART-1] e, [ORG-5] has an open [ORG-25] I, so information can flow in and out of [WORK_OF_ART-1] e. any requirements.
Agent: I'm going very fast. Maybe [ORG-7] has to send me a financial report for me to disperse different funds. So all these requirements can be linked to a disbursement.
Agent: So before I receive the financial report, that money cannot be mobilized. This is all something that comes out of the box.
Agent: I'm not familiar with the actual grants and application process at the [ORG-4], but hopefully this has given you an idea of what could be possible in [ORG-5].
Agent: And obviously this is a system that can be completely customizable to your needs. I'm just showing you what is out of the box.
Speaker 4: Any questions so far before we move to [ORG-1], because I want to give them enough time. Just a quick this platform can be presented in terms of the dashboard question.
Agent: So
Agent: In the first place, right?
Agent: For example, if you want how many members are we put in sand?
Agent: It's shown in, for example, number of the members. Absolutely. Absolutely. [PERCENT-1] any data that you have within [ORG-5], you can create reports and you can create the dashboard on. So it is [PERCENT-1] possible.
Agent: What I have right here at the beginning is just an example. You can create this many
Speaker 4: Dashboards and reports that you want
Speaker 5: That could be invisible to either you, your team, to everybody else you.
Agent: Or only [ORG-33]. Thank you.
Speaker 5: I guess exporting data as well, [PRODUCT-1] and stuff like that is, of course, something that comes with it as well. Absolutely. In fourth and export. Perfect. And I have two more questions.
Speaker 5: You've shown the Workflow that sits behind, let's say one of these opportunities or grant programs as we call them as well, where from an [ORG-8] side. going through the application process, you would need to provide certain information.
Speaker 5: And that's opportunity specific data.
Speaker 5: But then as we saw in the [ORG-8] or member profile page, there may be also a data component where an [ORG-8] has more general information as address name, and then maybe even finance relevant information, like bank account information, that then is applicable or true, I guess, for all grant programs, meaning, you know, what's the bank account that you'll receive the funds through, it doesn't matter what the opportunity is.
Speaker 5: And so I wonder if the Workflow or the system does differentiate between these two types of data and how then And just to avoid have to provide the same information twice Versus it polling it from certain areas where this has been that somebody doesn't
Agent: Previously provided I'll pause here, and then I have a second question Yes, so long story short, the system will do whatever you tell it to do.
Agent: So if you want to pull that data that has been provided somewhere else, obviously where does the data fit?
Agent: Usually it should say to the members profile.
Agent: So if they've already provided a bank account, obviously, when we're talking about banks, when we're talking about bank accounts, this is extremely secure information that we might not want to surface to everybody. So maybe only the finance department.
Agent: Needs to have at the bank .
Speaker 5: A look
Agent: Information or the bank number that they provided. So that is something that [PERCENT-1] we can do. The Workflow was just an example, but you can massage it and customize it and create new ones.
Agent: I have so many created that will fire according to
Speaker 5: Whatever you want it to do. So you have flexibility. And then there's a change process as well in terms of approval. I think you mentioned that as well.
Agent: If somebody changes the bank account, then that needs to be and all of that stuff.
Speaker 5: Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. This is something that you can define. Perfect. And then my last question is around accessibility. I'm not sure if this has been discussed before. I'm just going to ask the question.
Speaker 5: So of course, within our team, but also the NPCs, there may be cases in which somebody is living with a visual or hearing impairment, let's say.
Speaker 5: And so we have a very specific use case here in terms of making sure that information that's being published.
Speaker 5: Has gone through a check and a test basically how this is then viewable or hearable to someone with an impairment as well and then secondly on the end user side on the client side it would be also helpful to understand how there's like a reader function that especially for
Agent: For VI impairments, you whatever is on the screen versus seeing it.
Speaker 4: Can basically hear
Agent: Yes, so, yeah, actually. I agree with the question. Yeah, so this is extremely, extremely important. Thank you for bringing this up. So we go through all the accessibility standards. [ORG-5] does have the WCAG2 Accessibility Initiative standard, obviously.
Agent: This is true all for internal and external users as well. I'm going to send you all the information just because of the time crunch. of what [ORG-5] does and what is the experience for
Speaker 4: The internal users that live with
Agent: Impairments and external users as well So what would be the members experience from a court ?
Agent: Also can this be multiple language as well, right?
EndUser: Yes, [PERCENT-1].
Agent: Please.
EndUser: Pmo pause may be here for a second. Because there are any questions or questions related to that. Sure, I have it. I have no more questions.
EndUser: So establishing a single source of truth for the members, it started like a first step for the organization. So we have all the members in one place. OK, we used to come.
EndUser: A few cases, a few applications that they can submit or things that they can apply for. But this is going to be a constant development. So we will have new ways of engaging with members.
EndUser: For example, we'll have different stakeholders that need to participate in different workflows, such as they say we have a general assembly and we need them to apply for participating in general assembly or we need to invite them.
EndUser: And ask them to submit information about travel or to convey to our membership gathering and stuff.
EndUser: So how does work in case you want to add another Workflow to the system?
EndUser: Is it something that we can kind of customize
Agent: Or we need the help of the partner?
Agent: But I mean, what is the extendability of the opportunity?
Agent: So I think I've read the answer to this would be it depends. So if you have so this is something for the Workflow automation.
Agent: If you want to create approval process is all that this will be included in your licenses. So it's not that you need that, you know, you need to purchase more or something like that.
Agent: So literally in the setup right here you can go in and you can create your Workflow for an approval process for an application process, whatever you want. I think it will depend. the complexity.
Agent: If you are already familiar with [ORG-5], how it works, it would be incredibl y easy. We have drill head modules, drill head is ou r gamified learning platform, free of charge.
Agent: You don't have to be a customer to use it, where you can learn how to use the flows that I was telling you about. So this is something you can have completely autonomy upon.
Agent: I guess maybe for the beginning a partner will create a few workflows to show you and I will give, I think this is the perfect segue
EndUser: For [ORG-1] because I think they will be able to explain this better than myself. Okay.
EndUser: I think you did a little bit of time and I think those are all the questions I have a couple more but maybe we can do
Agent: In another session so yeah thank you very much for them on the presentation.
Speaker 6: Sounds good. Yeah, come on over to you.
Speaker 6: Okay, great. Then we will pick it up from here.
Speaker 6: We will try to keep it as short as possible, but what should be the main message, we are able to deliver, let's say, your vision into reality, right?
Speaker 6: So the we are the partner for translating whatever is possible in salesforce to concrete features for your end users, for your members, for the athletes, maybe at [DATE-8]. So quick look on the agenda.
Speaker 6: Few words on why we think [ORG-1] could be the right partner for you. Also our understanding, which is very similar to what we have heard from [PERSON-1], by the way. So we are quite aligned here.
Speaker 6: Then we will show you our approach to bring this to life potentially. We have a high level solution sketch that's already quite technical. So I'm not needed if we need to build it.
Speaker 6: Detail, but we would also show you a potential project setup and a potential timeline for first [ORG-25], so mini-mill valuable product basically, what could be your first step.
Speaker 6: And we give you a glimpse on some of our tools that could support this Implementation project here as well. And later on I think we will also discuss about the potential indication here.
Speaker 6: So why [ORG-1]?
Speaker 6: I will keep it very short. So first of all, we are already a partner of [ORG-5], but we are already a partner of the [ORG-4] as well and also the [EVENT-1] family on a global level.
Speaker 6: I think we had already several touch points here. Like [PERSON-10] mentioned, we have gained a lot of expertise in the sporting world via the sports business group over [DATE-9].
Speaker 6: I think that is something we can definitely also bring here to the table with fresh ideas from similar companies. But of course, we also can bring our full consulting knowledge from all the other industries.
Speaker 6: And I think that can really, really help us to also foster some efficiency gains and so on to really bring in some fresh air.
Speaker 6: At [DATE-8], it's really, you can be ensured that for each of the project phases, we deliver at the highest possible quality and we are also capable of.
Speaker 6: Scaling because I thin k Your organization point of view, I think, at [DATE-8], one of the limiting factors will be also resources.
Speaker 6: So we are able to scale our project teams to your demand, so that we are not overwhelming you, but nevertheless, still delivering the highest possible quality and inequality. Correct.
Speaker 6: On our approach, just to give you a little bit of better understanding what digital stands for. So we are not a pure Implementation partner. Our services go far beyond. It's from creation of strategies together with you.
Speaker 6: We are creating very, let's say, creativity or creative aspects as well. For example, we are performing marketing campaigns together with clients. We are even designing the complete marketing entry stories for clients. lines and other brands, for example .
Speaker 6: It's the classical process reengineering. So if you would like to touch your finance processes and need some support there, we could also do this. All this we bundled together with, let's say, technology Implementation skills at D-load [ORG-39].
Speaker 6: There's far more I could tell you, but what is maybe important, we try to follow always these three major phases. That's the bottom of it. If we could quickly stay there. Thanks.
Speaker 6: It's always the imagine, the deliver, and the run. So. All our projects follow this approach.
Speaker 6: So in the beginning we try to, let's say, envision the first step, the first product that we would bring life, would create together and bring to life.
Speaker 6: And then next phase we will implement this together with you, together with [ORG-5].
Speaker 6: And then we will bring you to the point where you can bring it live and where you can also run the system because I think that is also very crucial for you.
Speaker 6: You don't want to be always dependent on us, right?
Speaker 6: So it's always one of our major targets to hand you over the steering wheel as soon as possible and that you are also in a position to constantly develop this platform further for the needs and maybe only need our help or other implementation.
Speaker 6: But I hope for more complex things Yep . Then very specific to [ORG-5], I will bring it to the line. We are worldwide the leading [ORG-5] partner. We have certified experts in all regions of the world.
Speaker 6: Customers are very, very happy with us that you can see in the bottom left corner. So customer satisfaction scores are very high. and I think we would have a very similar experience.
Speaker 6: I will give you all this to read after the presentation.
Speaker 7: Let's talk a little bit more about the [PRODUCT-2] and [NORP-3].
Speaker 7: That is where you are coming into place, right?
Speaker 7: Yeah. So we as already presented by [ORG-5] understood, your challenges that we actually want to create the single source of truth with the member portal, also having a streamlined process without a machine to just be more efficient.
Speaker 7: And really want to focus here on the member profile and Workflow management for the first phase.
Speaker 7: So how we deliver it, I will explain you in [TIME-8], but just to also make sure that we are on the same page is really an ambition to create the digital solution strategy, according to your wishes.
Speaker 7: So therefore we will actually start with detailing out and designing a journey for the corresponding member athletes, but also the users of the system. And that should be future-proof.
Speaker 7: And scalable and therefore we really want to deepen the engagement to move away from th e corresponding traditional model which includes a lot of emailing .
Speaker 7: And yeah, with the technology evolving, we can even leverage a lot of processes and automations to create less manual work and have a satisfaction increased on our site.
Speaker 7: And how we are doing that, that's maybe a good point at also coming to the first or one of the points that we mentioned. So of course, we need to have a combined journey.
Speaker 7: So we need to look at what is successful, what's capable of, what are your urgency needs, what are the capabilities of your organization, and from our points of view, we need to start with a minimal viable product.
Speaker 7: So that means that we really take the most critical points, the most useful things that we have and the standard with [ORG-25] profit cloud and directly focus on things that have been shown by [PERSON-1] and even tacklin g your pain points .
Speaker 7: To implement the management. Therefore, we actually have the capability to be really fast because we're focusing on a minimal viable project.
Speaker 7: The good thing is with building that as a basis, we could even in a later time point, when we have empowered you to even use that [ORG-25], modify it yourself. to extensions.
Speaker 7: Then we can even include more integration to other systems automating there.
Speaker 7: And of course, if we actually want to look in the near future, we could even go into very fancy stuff where we could force me like [GPE-5] or [GPE-6] have a real platform where the whole athletes membership can manage everything in one platform.
Speaker 7: But let's focus on the [ORG-25] for that one. So let's have a look on how to realize an [ORG-25] and what are the corresponding faces that young have been mentioned.
Speaker 7: That would mean that we come to the [ORG-25], Deliver, and Run phase. Big focus is actually on the [ORG-25] phase. So you have seen hopefully a lot of things where you are like, ah, this would be useful.
Speaker 7: This is useful. But in the end, we need to detail down what is really bringing the most effort with the least corresponding potential conflicts on other processes.
Speaker 7: So therefore we would actually start with the corresponding process and user design in order to prioritize what we want to deliver.
Speaker 7: So here what is very important we need to have directly changed communication included to make sure that the users are in the end empowered to use the system and even the admins which [PERSON-1] was mentioning if you want to quickly change certain pictures on the corresponding community or even on the home page the new KPI is to develop that you don't need.
Speaker 7: A partner and spend money and yeah that you are unable to realize that one i n this start even in the imagine phase to know okay how do we approach such a topi c If we then have scoped the [ORG-25], we will deliver it with of course an agile framework.
Speaker 7: We even have certain tools that we will use to really use the [DATE-10] development in order to have certain methodologies that hopefully you will get used to already used to resprint planning, corresponding user acceptance and then the corresponding launch of the product.
Speaker 7: The continuous improvement would be then a mix of additional projects that we can combine in the corresponding slide shown before or even when you are empowered to do it yourself. And yeah.
Speaker 7: If there are questions happy if you ask me, I will even just have a briefly talk about the solution sketch. So we have exactly the same opinion what was shown actually by [ORG-5].
Speaker 7: We would leverage the released nonprofit cloud from [ORG-5] to really combine the excellence of sales or even customer relationship or even member relationship. However, we would like to call it with the corresponding service and experience cloud.
Speaker 7: So we can see we have focused on a lot of corresponding components here from your requirements list, but this is still a draft.
Speaker 7: We need to really have a detailed discussion on what would be your highest priority, maybe even something if you say the corresponding feature that was presented by [PERSON-1] with this signature.
Speaker 7: So important and the pain point and right now you are not able to capture the signature, verify it. Then we even would have on the right side some external partners to use them leverage.
Speaker 7: Them to have also that signature from the first graph we would exclude it because thi s is of course an additional license. It's a little bit of integration to include tha t corresponding functionality .
Speaker 7: But of course, that's your pain point we can adjust the corresponding high level architecture.
Speaker 7: And due to the time I will already jump to the project setup, most important thing on the slide is not what is on the right.
Speaker 7: So we will start with a small lean team where we would actually have a project manager, a corresponding technical function, lead and developers. The most important part is on the left side. Let's leverage the collaboration.
Speaker 7: So there are a lot of standards features from [ORG-5] also for the scoping workshop. We can likely look into the demo of what was presented by [PERSON-1]. You have a career.
Speaker 7: Which we would need to know in order to have really the one team approach to work to one goal which would be a great [ORG-25], which might be even a valuable to use already at [GPE-7] or whatever is your timeline and coming to that one even then I would take a look at the next slide .
Speaker 7: Go to the timeline, we are ready. So we have executed certain products and we can leverage the standard at last. So we would invest in beginning of [DATE-8] to do this scoping workshop.
Speaker 7: So really, using our corresponding offices where we have a really free, open-minded possibility to brainstorm and define on the scoping workshop.
Speaker 7: So with that, we can provide you by maybe end of [DATE-8] concrete offer on what would be the cost for the corresponding project, which could potentially Go Live mid of May, of course.
Speaker 7: This is accordingly to all the best scenario that we are able to collaborate and finalize [DATE-15]. But even if we move a little bit, we are still before [DATE-15].
Speaker 7: And if you have the goal to leverage some of the shown features for an event of the [GPE-7]. that would be possible in our opinion because, as mentioned, we are ready.
Speaker 7: Because I'm already over time, I would just give you a quick hand on what tools we have. So, yeah, we have a [ORG-5]-based [ORG-41]-I project management tool, which will actually leverage all the corresponding [ORG-5] features and risk management.
Speaker 7: How do you have a question?
EndUser: Yes, I had a question about the side before this one. So what this means is basically that we need to have this coping workshop first and then we'll be able
Speaker 7: To get it all from you.
Speaker 7: Or maybe you can even take over, but you would be able to get an offer without a scoping workshop, but it would not be super precise or they're a little bit more assumption, if we in comparison if we would do a scoping workshop.
EndUser: And. I think that is still fine. I mean, if you give us an estimation. first and then we'll review the estimation and then we can make it a bit more precise through a spoken workshop.
EndUser: I will say that we appreciate the initial assessment first.
Speaker 6: Yeah, that we can do. So of course that would have then certain underlying, let's say, assumptions.
Speaker 6: And to be honest, we would provide you a range because, yeah, everything else, I think we would really need this scoping workshop for.
Speaker 6: But with that, you could have at least then the feeling of what kind of invest you would need to take it to at least brings something like an [ORG-25] life. I can also understand this.
Speaker 4: We can provide you this during [DATE-10]. And it was still based on the number of sprints that a specific project is done, right, together with the team.
Speaker 4: What if, let's say, for example, if we get a code like minimum team members, let's say we do the project management on our side and we just need like the dead person from your side.
Speaker 4: And then let's say we do the scrum master and everyone else from our side.
Speaker 4: Would that be?
Speaker 4: Or I think, no, sorry, I let me correct myself. I think it is, yeah, we can base it from the minimum spend numbers you have and then that
Speaker 6: Correct, correct. But yeah, of course we could also discuss these topics.
Speaker 6: For now we have really thought about the absolute minimal project team we could offer to really ensure that we are sufficient here to reach the goal I for you, right?
Speaker 6: And of course, step by step, you could then also take over more and more responsibilities,
EndUser: But what you have seen me on the team status, I would say, is the minimal setup. We could start with. As the initial test [DATE-13] would we also
Speaker 6: Get the election this
Agent: Cost from you or. [ORG-5] provides those. We have prepared the only sense of cost.
EndUser: So
Agent: You get as part of the slide and sharing after.
Speaker 7: We can share everything with you out there. Okay. And the rest of the team obviously. So yeah, maybe just to wrap up because that's exactly our last slide.
Speaker 7: So I will, because we already over time, you can have a look at this one. We actually have these, yeah, more or less. [GPE-8] project management tool with a lot of feature which actually becomes your intellectual property afterwards.
Speaker 7: So you have even for other projects, the corresponding project management tool, which is very beneficial.
Speaker 7: And we are actually part of the corresponding national organization committee to have their certain assets developed that can be leveraged about all [EVENT-1] committees. And yeah, that are certain examples. You can have a look in the slide.
Speaker 7: And yeah, the most important part for you would mention those by honest, our really lean team, which we're actually proposing is really what you can see. We have reduced the project management to [DATE-13] over [DATE-18].
Speaker 7: So nearly everything is already included and really completely on the corresponding development side because that would was our approach, which would fit to the corresponding organization and has been similar, I think. realized also with the [ORG-25] team.
Speaker 7: So, yeah, that would be the first comment to your questio n already . And with that, yeah, already. Thank you and time for any additional question.
Speaker 4: Yeah, sorry. I think we missed.
Speaker 4: Maybe it goes back to the question to [ORG-5], the mask communication side, like if it's going to
Agent: Be an outlook or a different method. Well, was there was there something that thing we didn't cover that right. Yes, so for the mass communication, either you do it from the [PRODUCT-3], obviously there are some limitations.
Agent: We didn't go through into the details in very deep requirements, in very deep.
Agent: Or we can go and look at the [ORG-5] automation to [ORG-25] tool that where you have, you can create what we call the different journeys.
Agent: If somebody logs in or somebody signs up to a newsletter, for example, maybe you want to remind members of the company.
Agent: Of something or maybe you want to let them know that there is a new grant that they can apply, this is something that we can look at for the [ORG-25] tool.
Agent: If there is a one-to-one communication then our understanding is either you can do it or you can do it without look and
Speaker 4: From [ORG-5] obviously you can merge the two. We didn't go into the details for lack of time. But we will be positive that for us, if we have members and let's say email addresses from each then we have
Agent: Member in their profile. Yeah, and the same platform can we
Speaker 4: Do a mass communication for example. yeah.
Agent: Okay, thank you.
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: Any other question.
Agent: Another question rather than kind of a summary of what we like to get next. So,
Agent: As we, as we, as you're already aware, we, we have, we've been running a digital transformation program and identify the field those areas which we would like to.
EndUser: Transform through the technology. And the membership engagement and the membership portal is the one that is on top of the monitor. The one who identifies as a priority. So, and we definitely want to work on that one.
EndUser: And we have a significant limitation [DATE-25], which is games, and we have games in between.
EndUser: One major part of our assessment is going to be whether we can already start doing something before the games, and then something which might be usable or which might make sense and won't disrupt the normal game operations, or do we complete this ship based on [DATE-25]?
EndUser: And for us to be able to make that assessment.
EndUser: We already have a critical understanding of the, but at this based on your offer of coordinating days, it's a good understanding of how much effort is required and what could be the time line.
EndUser: We need to look inwards and see what the power effort looks like, how much do you need to be involved in this project. I assume it would be a significant investment from our end as well.
EndUser: Now, for the cost element in it, which has two components. One is the time investment from the lower end, from the lower end, and also the direct sensing.
EndUser: On [DATE-25], I can make an assumption of what that could mean based on the previous projects we've liked. But for the licensing, I'm still a bit certain.
EndUser: So although, so I'm not going to be a runner if you could share with me the license to cost a towards. I'd appreciate if you could go to share with me the licensing cost.
EndUser: For the other entity that we shared with you, which is mass communications for our [PRODUCT-2] team.
EndUser: So it was a more typical theorem, mass communication function, which is not exactly related to the membership management, but it's more, all the B2C function, which is with new letters or fan engagement and stuff like that.
EndUser: So that would really help us understand How much the total investment is going to be both time and material, time and cost, and where we can position this, whether it makes sense to do something in [DATE-25], and still need to make, or whether we'll have to say, okay, of focus
Agent: Is a good type
Speaker 6: Of service. Yeah. Yeah. maybe one comment from my side.
Speaker 6: I think you touched a very important area also if you have the capacity to perform this before, before the games, right?
Speaker 6: So the minimum requirement we from a delivery point of view we would foresee on your side is at least to a small degree of person from your IT team supporting us on a [DATE-25] basis and somebody from the business areas that should use the tool later on.
Speaker 6: So if you ask myself, I would tell maybe [PERCENT-2] minimum of those persons would need to go into this project.
Speaker 6: If you would like to have a chance for a really successful Implementation and also, let's say, having a chance for high user adoption afterwards, because if we involve these people from the business very early, They will be somehow ambassadors for the system later on, hopefully, right?
EndUser: So just from our experience here. Yeah. So this is for the light.
EndUser: Would you mind stating those coordinating days to natural number?
Speaker 6: I mean, I'd like to have it as a fault. Yeah, we will share it also with [DATE-25] raids for the different levels. You will get this and then we will give you a range for the [ORG-25] where you
EndUser: Could range up. Yeah, okay. Very helpful. Thank you.
Agent: Okay, then we will send respectively the information. Are there as you expected and I will post a Recording also and then make sure that we give you access to the recording.
Agent: And then when would you like to reconnect potentially?",Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?,"The sales rep did ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent. These questions were aimed at understanding the customer's requirements, pain points, and expectations from the seller's product. Here are some examples:

1. ""I just wanted to reiterate what we've heard from you so far. Obviously, we've had several conversations with [PERSON-3] and [GPE-1] over [DATE-1]. And we read your requirements and the white paper that you shared.""
2. ""So, starting off was we need [QUANTITY-1] view as single source of truth of the member profile.""
3. ""So, all the data that we've captured of the members, whether they are [ORG-2], [ORG-3], we want to have in one system, we don't want to find data in different places, and the profile needs to have structured and unstructured data.""
4. ""Following that is how can we better communicate with the members?""
5. ""They need to have access to what we have defined a member portal to improve the communication between the members and the [ORG-4], especially for the members department.""
6. ""So that communication is going to be translated into what we call insults first terms a case, they will then be routed to the appropriate teams.""
7. ""Why are we doing this?""
8. ""This is because we want to digitize the way that we do things currently at the [ORG-4] for the members department and we want to move away from traditional email-based processes.""
9. ""So also we're going to see how we can implement and automate some of the Workflow processes within the system.""
10. ""Are we on the Is that what you, did we understand you correctly?""

These questions helped the sales rep to understand the customer's needs and expectations, and to tailor the demo accordingly.","Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?","Based on the transcript, the customer did seem to feel that the seller's product meets their needs. They expressed that the membership engagement and portal feature is a priority for their digital transformation program, and the seller's product appears to address this need. The customer also asked about the licensing cost and the effort required for implementation, indicating a serious interest in moving forward with the product. However, they also mentioned some limitations and concerns related to their upcoming games, so further discussion may be needed to address those concerns.",What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?,"The customer expressed excitement about the prospect of using the seller's product to create a single source of truth for member profiles, which would allow them to have all member data in one system and improve communication with members through a member portal. They also appreciated the ability to customize the system to fit their specific needs and the potential for automation of workflow processes. The customer specifically mentioned the benefits of having a streamlined process and the ability to manage everything in one platform.",Identify opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs.,"1. The sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customer's specific pain points and requirements related to capturing and verifying signatures in the grant process. Although the rep briefly mentioned the possibility of using external partners for signature capture, they did not delve deeper into the customer's needs or concerns in this area.

2. The rep could have explored the customer's requirements for mass communication more thoroughly. While they mentioned the possibility of using the [ORG-5] automation tool for journeys and one-to-one communication, they did not discuss the customer's existing [PRODUCT-3] for mass communication or how the two systems could be integrated.

3. The rep could have asked more questions about the customer's digital transformation program and their priorities for technology investments. This would have helped the rep better understand the customer's context and tailor their proposal accordingly.

4. The rep could have inquired about the customer's capacity to start the project before the games and the potential impact on game operations. This would have helped the rep provide more specific advice on the best approach for the customer's situation.

5. The rep could have asked about the customer's existing licensing costs for [ORG-5] and the [PRODUCT-2] team's mass communication function to provide a more accurate estimate of the total investment required.

In general, the sales rep could have asked more open-ended questions and listened more actively to the customer's responses to better understand their needs and priorities. This would have helped the rep provide more targeted advice and build a stronger relationship with the customer.",What were the top 3 questions the sales rep asked where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards?,"1. Question: ""Is it possible to have a workflow or approval process before changes to the member profile are reflected? Specifically, if someone updates the Secretary General's name, can it go through a review and approval process before it updates in the member's profile?""
   Engagement: The customer showed interest and asked a follow-up question about the flexibility to customize the member profile view based on the person logging in.

2. Question: ""Is it possible to have a chat function in the member portal, where the chat would be routed to an appropriate agent or team member based on the category or theme of the question?""
   Engagement: The customer asked for more details about the chat function, specifically whether it could be routed to individual people based on the topic or department.

3. Question: ""Can the system differentiate between opportunity-specific data and general member information, and avoid requiring the member to provide the same information twice?""
   Engagement: The customer asked for more information about how the system handles different types of data and how it can ensure a smooth experience for members when applying for opportunities.

These questions seemed to generate more engagement from the customer, as they asked follow-up questions and showed interest in the specific features and capabilities.",What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?,"The transcript does not provide clear information on the customer's specific concerns about the seller's product. The customer asked some questions about the product's features and capabilities, such as the ability to customize the member portal experience for different audiences, the possibility of a chat function, and the integration with other systems. However, these questions do not necessarily indicate concerns, but rather a desire to understand the product better.

Answer to this question is unclear."
video_19794_167_6qr3y000000ohYQAAY,"Speaker 5: Great. Well, great. Well, happy
Agent: To spend some time with y'all this afternoon, especially right after the holidays. So, you know, [PERSON-1] and I. spend some time going through the notes that we took from that first call with you all.
Agent: And so we put together, you know, some slides to kind of talk through marketing clouds [DATE-1]. But we'd like to always kick off our presentations with a thank you all.
Agent: Thank you for the moment of gratitude just for you all being here with us for, you know, you know, taking this time [DATE-2].
Agent: I'm sure there's a lot of catching up to do from the holidays. So being able to take a little break from that. So we appreciate you all. doing that to me that time with us [DATE-1].
Agent: And if you've ever sat through a [ORG-1] presentation we always show our forward-looking statements, because just a reminder that we are publicl y created companies, so to be sure to make your purchasing decisions on products that ar e readily available [DATE-1] .
Agent: So don't need to read all that. Always fun. So we'll start. We don't need to do introductions. So I think we've all met each other here [DATE-1]. So we can fly through introductions.
Agent: And then we'll just spend a quick moment recapping what we heard [DATE-3] about what you're currently doing with part I, and then jump into the Marketing Cloud demo. That sounds all right. And you all.
Agent: So we were worried all the way back to [DATE-4] before the holidays. We, you know, got to spend some time with you all discussing what you're currently doing with hard.
Agent: In how Marketing Cloud may fit into the picture and the overall strategy. You know, what we heard was a lot about some potential for some efficiencies.
Agent: Y'all can gain less switching to Marketing Cloud into, you know, maybe improve on some of the manual processes you are currently doing, especially when it comes to, you know, the students going through the funnel from being admitted all the way through enrollment.
Agent: That right now there's a lot of manual processes you'll have to do in order to you know keep that communication going with the students and especially you know making sure they're targeted to the programs and the schools that they're admitted to as students change majors and do all the different changes that happen between being admitted to enrolling and leading up to orientation.
Agent: That if there's some possible efficiencies to gain with marketing cloud, so maybe you're not having to have all the school look at spreadsheets every day and compare changes and make things a little more streamlined automatic, that could be something helpful that you could get gained with marketing cloud.
Agent: And so we're gonna focus the rest of the afternoon on some of those like wins that you can get with Marketing Cloud and how it can improve.
Agent: Know what you're currently doing and how to make things a lot more efficient and then potentially you know how you can then look at how effective right now it sounded like you know being able to measure the effectiveness of some of your communications was a challenge and so figuring out ways to get with Market with Thought could help there too.
Agent: So with that, I'm going to turn it over to [PERSON-1] who spends some time putting together a demo focusing on some of these key areas to kind of show you how marketing thought can help and get your feedback on it.
Agent: Sounds like plan. Alright, [PERSON-1], how will turn it over to you then my friend.
Agent: Perfect. Thanks, [PERSON-2] and hi again everyone. I'll be off camera for the demonstration piece just that has my sharing multiple screens here typically has my computer fans, you know, running really hard and it sounds like a train sometimes.
Agent: I also in advance just want to share. I'm recovering from coven is my first go around with coven on [DATE-5].
Agent: And I feel fine, but I may need a pause to just cough a little or just take a sip of water. So please feel free as well throughout to ask any questions.
Agent: You know, we've got some good Content to cover with you all today And in terms of what to expect overall for our time together here I have this divided into five different sections largely to touch on a lot of what we heard in our last conversation with you But it also gives us some natural pauses throughout as well to dive a little bit [PERSON-3] r into any particular topic that may be of interest to you as well spend most of the time within the platform as [PERSON-4] You'll see this slide sort of [ORG-2] as we go throughout as [PERSON-4] But at least what to expect her e. I first wanna kick things o ff by first introducing you to Marketing Cloud at a very, very high [ORG-3] before touching on [GPE-1] and how Marketing Cloud supports [PERSON-5] So how different team s, could possibly work together within the same [PRODUCT-1] instance.
Agent: But also, how does that help us from a visibility perspective in terms of the messages that our constituents are receiving from different departments, different divisions, for example. From there, we'll have a bit more explicit conversation around data.
Agent: So how do we get data into the platform?
Agent: How can we build off of that unified data and do things like segmentation?
Agent: And what does that segmentation experience look like within the platform?
Agent: We'll do a little bit of a deeper dive around email as well. Not necessarily building a complete email from scratch, although we can do that. If that's something that's of interest to the group.
Agent: But my goal as we talk about email is largely to focus on some efficiencies around personalization and possibly some different ways that we can simplify some of your email creation process as well.
Agent: From then on, my favorite component is always talking about journeys. So in the part out world, this would be the equivalent of your engagement studio. It's journeys within marketing cloud.
Agent: So really looking at how do we automate your Outreach in key moments across the applicant lifecycle, but also ways that we can perhaps start to adapt the experience by listening to your constituents' behavior and really engaging them on those changes.
Agent: That are most effective at a specific point in their applicant life cycle . And then we'll ultimately wrap up around reporting and analytics as well.
Agent: So just some out of the box options available to you to really understand what's working, what's not working across your different marketing and communications efforts here.
Agent: Is there anything at least from the agenda perspective that, you know, we should spend most of our time on or is there anything missing perhaps that you haven't heard that we'll cover yet?
Agent: All right, so we'll keep the train moving here. So again, first we'll kick it off with an overview of marketing cloud. all of the different components that are built into the Marketing Cloud platform.
Agent: And then we'll have that more explicit conversation around governance here. So switching over to Marketing Cloud here. If this is your first time seeing the platform welcome. Where we're at in the platform here is the Marketing Cloud homepage.
Agent: And I wanted to kick off our conversation [DATE-1] on the homepage here, just so we can touch at a very high level, all of the different components that are built in to marketing cloud.
Agent: So really serving as that unified marketing platform for you. So what I'll direct your attention to here is in the top third or so of your screen here.
Agent: This is going to be that navigation bar that will be consistently appearing wherever you are in the platform. It's what you would use to navigate different areas of Marketing Cloud here.
Agent: In the top left, you have what we refer to as studios.
Agent: And this is what's going to help you create for and manage different key channels, whether that's email, which we'll do a deeper dive for later in the presentation.
Agent: In our last conversation, we spoke about mobile, right?
Agent: [DATE-6] you use [PERSON-6]. I'll touch on how we could integrate with [PERSON-6] from a journey perspective here. But if in the future, this is something where perhaps you want to.
Agent: Separate sort of communications from [ORG-4] do more of that once in many broadcast through [PRODUCT-1] that's possible.
Agent: We also from a mobile perspective also suppor t marketing and communications through a mobile app We didn't touch on this in our last conversation I saw that WT has, I saw an iOS app, I'm an [ORG-5] guy so I look for iOS specifically Not sure if it's used from any admissions perspective, but if in the future, that's sort of a new channel perhaps th at you want to explore with prospective student s. I did want to touch that core to [PRODUCT-1] is the opportunity here to also [PERSON-7] prospective students through that mobile [ORG-6] as well is web.
Agent: And this is the component that you would largely use for things like landing pages or for things like RF5 forms, for example. An option to explore in the future is advertising.
Agent: I know from our last conversation, it's largely organic social that you do [DATE-1]. Not much advertising, paid advertising, if I remember correctly, but if in the future, this is something that you wish to explore with [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: This is definitely an add-on that we see customers grow into. From an advertising perspective, what you'll see when we talk.
Agent: About journeys, if this is sort of a new channel, perhaps that you want t o introduce here to your applicants or prospective students, is being able t o coordinate advertising alongside your email efforts, your SMS efforts, fo r example.
Agent: And from an advertising perspective, it's not necessarily buildin g your ads that we're supporting here. What we're doing with [PRODUCT-1] i s helping you automate your ad audiences.
Agent: I know budget i s something that's, you know, of top of mind for the grou p. And from an advertising perspective, you know, that could be expensiv e. That was a big line item when I was in admissions that we ha d. But this is a bit more of an opportunity here to really build, look like audience s. Build those targeted audiences that you want to reach and be a bit more intentional from an advertising [ORG-7] This is just something that I wanted to highlight for you as a growth area with the pla .
Agent: Um,
Agent: So outside of our studios working alongside there, you have what we refer to as builders.
Agent: And these are what's largely gonna help you to connect your data, your content, your channels together, whether that's gonna be for analytics purposes, whether it's gonna be for those automated journeys, our [PRODUCT-2] builder, which we'll see when we talk about email, this is sort of your asset repository within the platform.
Agent: Think of it as a very, very lightweight [ORG-8] where you're storing imagery. templates, even blocks of text as we'll cover later . You also have our audience builder, which we'll dive into in the next section here.
Agent: This is the area that we would focus on to connect our data sources alongside building out our targeted segments within the platform.
Agent: And what you'll see me also mention at different points throughout the demonstration is [PERSON-8], which you may already be familiar from the [PRODUCT-3] side. [PERSON-8] is our [PRODUCT-4] capabilities across the [ORG-1] ecosystem. And it's also built into marketing.
Agent: Cloud here. So we'll see opportunities here to tap into [PRODUCT-4] from both a predictive perspective but also a generative [PRODUCT-4] perspective as well .
Agent: And as I mentioned, I'd love to start here just to give you that broad level view of all the different components that are built into our [PRODUCT-1] platform.
Agent: Again, you're doing this from one single location versus needing to work across different systems to manage different channels or create those automated experiences here.
Agent: All of these components that we covered here can be turned on or off as needed, depending on a user's responsibility.
Agent: And ultimately, if the platform expands to support other schools or other divisions, for example, you know, certain divisions or teams may not need access to mobile or to advertising or web, for example, all of this is, you can configure with permissions to turn on or off as you need.
Agent: One of the areas that we spoke about in our last conversation was a little bit of a challenge around visibility into messaging, especially as you're getting closer to orientation.
Agent: It sounded like some different teams may be either sending the same type of communication or messaging, or even conflicting messaging, which I've experienced in the path before when I was in higher ed.
Agent: So what I wanna mention that out of the box with [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: You would also have access to a centralized calendar here What's going to be key here is thi s is one of those ways that's going to help increase visibilit y across any of those teams that are using [PRODUCT-1] .
Agent: For their marketing and communications efforts. That's all done through what we refer to as business units.
Agent: I'm gonna put a pause on what a business unit is for just one quick second, but I at least wanted to highlight for you that depending on your level of access, you could get visibility into what other teams, divisions, schools are sending through Marketing Cloud here.
Agent: And similar to [GPE-2], this is gonna automatically display any.
Agent: Past funds, any future scheduled funds, and you also have the ability to add manually you know, certain things like events or important deadlines that you want to meet The idea here, you know, it's one of those simple ways to increase visibility, but to also star t to eliminate some of that <inaudible> work, especially for those ad hoc communications on when to nex t <inaudible> and a communication and ensure that we're not over communicating with students on a particula r day of the week her e. I'll take a quick pause here, see if there are any questions so far before we talk about how different teams can work together from the same [PRODUCT-1] instance.
Agent: All right, and sorry if you hear me taking a sip of water here. Alright, so let's move more into that governance conversation here.
Agent: What I want to highlight at a very high level is that [PRODUCT-1] itself is built on an Enterprise architecture.
Agent: What does that mean?
Agent: Well, it means that the platform itself is designed to scale with you as needs change. It could be as simple as supporting a single team. Or we can scale this to support the entire university end-to-end.
Agent: And we have customers where it's only one unit of the university using [PRODUCT-1] to others that are using this from admissions all the way through advancements and alumni relations.
Agent: How we're able to do this, as you see represented by these different rectangles here, is what we refer to as business units that you can think of as dedicated workspaces within the platform here.
Agent: And from a governance perspective, it's these dedicated workspaces that limit a team to only have access to the data, the content, the reporting that only applies to that specific business unit.
Agent: On the other hand, this is also an opportunity here from a brand consistency perspective to also share assets across these different business units.
Agent: So think of that as more marketing approved assets, you know, what's our approved logos, what are imagery that we should be including across our email communications to maintain that consistent brand regardless of who across the university is engaging our constituents.
Agent: And it's through these business units as well that you can scale over time.
Agent: So at any point, if a new team wishes to tap into [PRODUCT-1] and use the platform, it's simply a matter of just working with [PERSON-2] to either add a new business unit or just fairly simple, just conversation with [PERSON-2] there and she can work with you.
Agent: But I at least wanted to touch on here because this is that business unit sort of hierarchy.
Agent: That helps different schools, divisions, teams coexist within the same [PRODUCT-1] instance And really at [DATE-7], ensure that you're only accessing what your tea m specifically needs for their marketing and communications .
Agent: So what we've seen so far, a lot of those different components you with marketing cloud, you know, business units and available to
Speaker 6: How we can use that to maintain governance within the platform. [PERSON-1], can I. For a second. I think it's important to note from my perspective anyway, that those additional business units do cost additional money.
Speaker 6: For each additional business unit we add there's a set price [DATE-8] that we have to pay that's added on to our contract. And I believe the next business unit would be $[MONEY-1] a month.
Agent: Yeah, I'll let [PERSON-2] chime in. If you want [PERSON-9], kind of the, I guess the package that we're thinking to in terms of business units or
Agent: I'll let you take that. Yeah, you're your spot on [PERSON-10]. So it is this issue has to cost, additionally. So, and that's something we can work through depending on volume of business units
EndUser: You could potentially need with that pricing would look like. I have a question with the business units. I used to be on the academic side. And so I went through this long time ago with academic affairs.
EndUser: And I know that academic affairs was a business unit.
EndUser: And [PERSON-9], you may know this, is graduate school and college or business, are they under academic affairs?
Speaker 6: I remember we had business units set up a long time ago. Yes, everything right now pretty much is under academic affairs. We have a business unit reserve for philanthropy Go Live with advanced.
EndUser: And external relations once we
Speaker 6: And we have one
EndUser: For student affairs.
Agent: Okay, okay, got it. And that I would say from how you structure business units here, I might not touch on that, but sort of that model is flexible to what makes sense for you at [PERSON-11].
Agent: You know, we see some customers structure their hierarchy, just like their reporting, their overall university work structure. We see it sometimes more of a flat sort of approach to business units.
Agent: So all the colleges are sort of on the same sort of level of the hierarchy. Or like you see here with, you know, you have your, your.
Agent: Parents sort of admissions unit if you will and right below that opportunity t o split that out by undergraduate or graduate. So this is all a hierarchy.
Agent: S o you have your top-level administrative unit, you have your sort of your chil d business unit here depending on how you structure that whether it's by school division, and then you can start to branch this further down as needed fo r what works for you at WT [DATE-1] .
Agent: So it's completely
Agent: Flexible.
Agent: Any other questions before we talk about data?
Agent: All right.
Agent: So... where we're moving into now is a focus on how Marketing Cloud works with your data and ultimately how do we get data in, how do we get data out, and what can we start to do with that data easily within the platform here.
Agent: So we jump back into the Marketing Cloud here. What you're seeing on your screen is just a visualization of how Marketing Cloud will work with your data here.
Agent: Marketing Cloud itself from a data model perspective, it's a relational data model. So what that means is that you have the opportunity here to connect directly to different types of systems.
Agent: And all of those data fields that you wish to bring into [PRODUCT-1], we're going to relate that back to each individual constituent. So some systems may have, you know, some bits of data points that others don't.
Agent: And what we're trying to help you do here with Marketing Cloud is build a bit more of that fuller 3D.
Agent: Degree view of your constituents across those different systems here And because this is a marketing platform we're pairing what you know about a constituent across your different systems We're pairing that with their engagement data within [PRODUCT-1] So how are they engaging or not engaging across different channels So it's both what we know about a constituent along with their engagement s and their behavior across your different marketing channels here .
Agent: How you bring data into the platform, you have a few different options here.
Agent: What I'm gonna focus on initially here is that direct connection through a connector that we have with the [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-3] or for you that would be enrollment [PRODUCT-5].
Agent: What's going to be slightly different here relative to [GPE-3] is how we work with different objects within the [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: So through this connector that we have, you synchronize the different standard or custom objects from the [PRODUCT-3] that you wish to bring in to [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: From our last conversation, I believe [PERSON-9], your team helps to move certain fields from custom objects onto the contact record or one of those standard objects. This is one of those ways of marketing [PRODUCT-6].
Agent: You wouldn't necessarily need to do that anymore. We can connect directly to those custom objects and with our relational data model here, still connect those data points to that single individual, that individual constituent.
Agent: These different standard or custom objects, how we're synchronizing them, is you're gonna specify what field specifically from those objects you wanna bring over.
Agent: You're also gonna specify the frequency, excuse me, the schedule that you wish to connect those objects to.
Agent: So this is something that's flexible here, where it could be as fast as connecting it as quickly as [TIME-1], all the way to [TIME-2]. So there might be certain objects.
Agent: Where we don't necessarily need that data [ORG-9] within the platform So you can specify that that's seeing schedule here I'm giving this a second to load here but what it's going to display for yo u is all of those different field s that we're at least connecting in my demo environment her e from our contact record So I would say from a data connection perspective this might be the primary [PERSON-11] y that you're connecting directly to enrollment R X to Marketing Cloud and keeping all of that data synchronize d. And we're not sort of refreshing the entirety of that data her e. The data synchronized so any data field that's been update d, that's what's going to sink ove r. We're not refreshing all of the dat a.
Agent: So from a synchronization [ORG-10] e, it tends to be a fairly quick and synchronized process her e.
Agent: Out of the box, [PRODUCT-1] does not offer a least scoring mechanism like part offers.
Agent: There are however ways that you can build that into the platform, whether it's building that automation directly within [PRODUCT-1] or exploring something like an app exchange partner that has a solution built out for lead scoring.
Agent: If you keep [WORK_OF_ART-1] and add on [PRODUCT-1] in the future, any of those fields from [WORK_OF_ART-1],
EndUser: We could bring into [PRODUCT-1] as well.
EndUser: Does that help answer your question, [GPE-4]?
EndUser: Yeah, that helps because one of the things that we know that we want to make sure that we're doing is as that as a student progresses through the process if they're not opening their emails or not interacting with things that we've sent them or Interacting with the social media.
EndUser: We know that those students are less likely to finish the entire process and we want to make sure that we're putting emphasis on our staff to The ones that are more likely to register and roll And so with that process, I
Agent: Just want to make sure that we understand what we have available to us. So thank you.
Agent: Yeah, and what I will highlight is through [PERSON-8], our [PRODUCT-4] within marketing cloud, there are two components that I'll touch on when we talk about journeys where from an engagement perspective, that's sort of the shift in [PRODUCT-1] that we're moving our scoring model to, right?
Agent: I did mention we don't have sort of that out-of-box Lead Scoring model like Part Not Offers where if you're scoring and grading your constituents, right?
Agent: But what we do offer with marketing cloud.
Agent: Is sort of [PRODUCT-4] driven scoring, if you will So what we're looking at is engagement How likely are they to click an email, open an email How saturated are they with communication So we do offer sort of more engagement focuse d scoring, if you will not necessarily the traditional Lead Scoring mode l that part offers [DATE-1] .
Agent: And we'll revisit that again when we talk about journeys. I'm excited to show you that piece as well.
Agent: Any other questions here before we move into segmentation here?
Agent: All right. So being able to have that flexibility and being able to connect across different data sources, what you're ultimately building here is that data foundation within marketing cloud.
Agent: And we want to make sure that you're able to action all of that connected data within the platform here. And one of those ways where that unified data foundation comes into play here is segmentation within the platform.
Agent: And that's what we're looking at here on your screen now. It's just an example of. a sample segment that I started looking at undergraduate applicants that ar e freshmen or transfer applicants.
Agent: From a segmentation perspective, this is goin g to be a clicks not Code approach. It's going to be a lot of drag and [ORG-9] functionality.
Agent: So your staff doesn't necessarily need to learn or [PERSON-11] w how to create SQL codes, for example. But if they prefer to work through SQL that's definitely available within the platform as well.
Agent: I'm not supe r technical myself in that end, so I prefer drag and drop functionality her e. What that experience is going to look like, again, building off of that data foundati on here on the left hand side, you're going to have access to all of those relevant fiel ds that you connect to Marketing [PERSON-16] And with a click of a button here, drag and drop functionality, I should say we can start to bring in over any of those fields that are going to be important for us as we build out our segments.
Agent: And with the click of a button, we can then start to adjust our filter logic here and or to account for any of that distinction between the fields that we've incorporated in our segment statement.
Agent: And here at the bottom, you can start to see what we're actually coding or you.
Agent: Using SQL for in the back end, but with drag and [ORG-9] functionality here So you can always verify that your logic within you r segments is representative of what it is that you want t o build .
Agent: All we're doing here so far is just segmenting based off of any of those data points that you're already collecting across your systems [DATE-1].
Agent: But because this is a unified marketing platform, as part of your segmentation strategy, you can also start to account for engagement behavior. That's what we're looking at here where I'm hovering my mouse now.
Agent: Our different measures that are out of the box with the platform that you can incorporate as part of your segmentation strategy.
Agent: So let's say we wanted to build our segment here and really identify those that have not actively engaged our emails in [DATE-9] here.
Agent: So this segment that we're building, perhaps it's, you know, we want to take our conversatio n offline for these types of students here And that's one of the, I would say the beauty of the platform and not only having data o f what you know about a constituent, but being able to layer on how they're engaging or no t engaging across your different marketing channels here and embedding that as part of your segmentatio n strategy .
Agent: The point here is building off of that unified data is that you can get granular with your segmentation here. And at [DATE-7], ensure that you're always identifying the right audience with the right message here.
Agent: And hopefully your takeaway there is that it's very easy to segment with within the platform there. And again, building off of that unified data foundation within marketing cloud.
Agent: And what I'll mention as well from a segmentation perspective, typically these segments that you're building are most commonly probably going to be used for an email send.
Agent: But from an efficiency standpoint, what I want to highlight is that any of these segments that you build within the platform can also be used across other areas of marketing cloud, whether it's to use this as a segment that we want to target for SMS purposes, whether it's a segment that we want to add on.
Agent: To a journey that we build which we'll cover in the fourth section of the demonstratio n [DATE-1] So, you know, these segments are not static You can use them beyond just email in different areas of the platform .
Agent: Alright, any questions before we move into the email experience here?
Agent: All right, so let's keep moving here. So from an email experience, I'm going to touch on different aspects of what email looks like within [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: We won't necessarily completely build an email together here, but I do want to touch on a few different components that are specific to the Marketing Cloud here.
Agent: The first that you see on your screen here is that [ORG-11]. This is going to serve as that.
Agent: That asset repository for you within the platform This is completely customizable from a foldering structur e to keep you organized in the [PERSON-13] e to your different campaigns or different sort of team s within the platform We're looking at this, this local ta b is what's saved directly to my business unit my teams workspace But as I mentioned earlier, through those business units you can also share assets [ORG-11] those different workspace And this is where you would access that shared tab here to access those shared resource s. From a [PRODUCT-2] perspective, this is where you would start to build out your differe nt email templates, your emails, your SMS messages, things like form s. Let's see what else do we got here.
Agent: We did forms, imagery, you would save here as well. So this is intended to be that asset repository for your different teams. As it relates to creating emails themselves, you have a few different options here.
Agent: So if your staff prefers to work off of HTML, that is an option here, but they don't need to do that.
Agent: Out of the box, which is similar to what you have with Part.[DATE-6], you do have access to pre-built templates that are already mobile optimized. They're also, as you'll see shortly, tap into drag and drop functionality.
Agent: So you don't necessarily need to. to learn or know how to Code your emails at HTML .
Agent: Outside of these out-of-the-box templates, you have some blank Content layouts as well, along with some thematic templates for things like newsletters, for example. You can access these out-of-the-box templates for any new emails.
Agent: You can also start to save any specific templates that are frequently used for your different types of communications here. So you're not always starting from scratch. You're the template that you wish to follow for your community.
Agent: I'm going to click out of this here. From an email creation process, just want to focus on a few different areas here.
Agent: Your marketers can either work off of a desktop or a mobile view as they build out your emails. And this template that you're seeing here is actually using one of our out-of-the-box templates.
Agent: So I did at least want to highlight that you can set to see how things are already mobile optimized for you. Any of those templates that you build within the platform can be completely locked down.
Agent: So in this example here, our header, our footer is completely locked down. Within the body of the email, we can also lock down specific sections of the body as well.
Agent: In terms of adding [PRODUCT-2] through your emails, you have a few different options here, some static content. So that could be, you know, adding a button into our email. It could be adding an image.
Agent: It could be adding text here. And similar to what you have at Pardot [DATE-1], it's a friendly, [ORG-11] editor. They should look fairly familiar for what you have access to in Pardot [DATE-1].
Agent: And generally, if you're using [PRODUCT-7] or something like [ORG-16], very familiar experience for you there. Outside of that static Content here, opportunities to conduct a B test, as well as dynamic Content for more advanced [PRODUCT-2] capabilities here.
Agent: Also an opportunity to tap into AI-driven content. So we see certain customers tap into AI here to select at the time of open certain imagery that that imagery is going to resonate most individual constituents.
Agent: So again, an opportunity here to really adapt that experience for eac h individual constituent .
Agent: From a personalization perspective, this is where we start to once again, build upon that data foundation within the platform. Fairly straightforward personalization. I think of this in a few different levels.
Agent: Level one is tapping into any of those data fields that you have connected to Marketing Cloud and using that as a merge field throughout the email subject line or the body of your emails.
Agent: A step up from that I like to think of as dynamic content. So from one single email, we can start to display different [PRODUCT-2] to different types of audiences.
Agent: What I think is going to be slightly different in [PRODUCT-1] relative to Pardot is that we can actually create dynamic Content a bit more granular if it is.
Agent: If I remember correctly, it's been a while since I've been in part. [ORG-13] is typically restricted to one single field. With Marketing Cloud, that's going to not be an issue here.
Agent: You can again tap into any of your data fields within the platform and start to build out who should see what specific piece of content. So a bit more flexibility from a personalization perspective.
Agent: And also, probably means that you're not creating specific.
Agent: [PERSON-16] just to be able to dynamically personalize your communications here And that experience, just as you saw here, it's actually going to be similar to how w e created our segments in the last section here So drag and drop functionality to define who should see what's a specific piece of [PRODUCT-2] .
Agent: And really that third layer of personalization is going to be that AI-driven Content for you.
Agent: What I haven't mentioned yet as another option to add [PRODUCT-2] to your emails, I'm going to delete this whole text block here and draw your attention to this create button that you see in the bottom left.
Agent: As of [DATE-10], if my timing is correct, we introduced some generative [PRODUCT-4] capabilities within [PRODUCT-1] here, where we can start to tap into generatively. to help us build out some [PRODUCT-2] .
Agent: I used to, when I was in admissions, I was partially responsible for creating [PRODUCT-2] for our different programs. I myself am not the most creative person and I'm being quite honest with you.
Agent: So some of my communications over time start to sound very similar to each other. But also, I was part of a small team. So to refresh our [PRODUCT-2] was sometimes a lift year on [DATE-9].
Agent: So I wish I had generative [PRODUCT-4]. back in [DATE-11] or so.
Agent: But what does that experience look like for you?
Agent: It's simply a matter of [PERSON-13] your prompts into our generative [PRODUCT-4] capabilities, selecting a type of brand personality. Out of th e box you have a Professional and casual brand personality.
Agent: You also have the ability to creat e up to 10 custom personalities that are reflective of you at WT . We'll say we want a casual personality. We'll accept our disclaimer. We'll hit Create.
Agent: And as this creates, it's going to spit out five different options or so of content. If you've worked with chat [ORG-16] before, you can start to train the model for the type of [PRODUCT-2] that's most important to you.
Agent: So, I'm going to go ahead and go ahead. from a accessibility perspective here and more so just having this available as an option.
Agent: It's a great way to brainstorm new ideas to refresh your [PRODUCT-2] much more quickly as well. So let's say we like a specific piece of content, we'll just simply add it into our email there and then move forward.
Agent: The last bit that I want to highlight for you from an email creation processes the ability to embed forms directly within your emails. Let's see. that should refresh once we go into preview mode.
Agent: But as part of our email creation process, you have the ability to embed forms directly within your emails. From an experience perspective, embedding these forms means that you're not directing your applicants to a landing page.
Agent: We often found when I was in admissions that we would see a drop-off. People would click the link, see that they have to go somewhere else and tend to not follow through with that form submission.
Agent: This is an opportunity here to build that directly within the email and have your applicants or your prospective students fill out the form directly within their inbox. These forms are completely customizable.
Agent: So you have options to customize the form and collect different types of data points, whether that's text-based field, drop-downs, things like radio buttons, checkboxes, or my favorites is the opportunity here to collect some ratings.
Agent: From a use case perspective, being able to use this after an admissions event to collect feedback, or like the form that I don't know.
Agent: Out here trying to collect some additional data points around a applicant's interes t at the specific point of time in their journey with you .
Agent: What's going to be key here is that any of these data points, these forms that get submitted, those responses do get Recorded back immediately into marketing [PRODUCT-8].
Agent: So what that means for you is that you can start to tap into those new data points, whether it's for personalization or segmentation for your next communication, or as you'll see here shortly, if I respond saying that I want to learn more about my financing options for my undergraduate degree.
Agent: If you have a journey already built out this is an opportunity to automate that process get that information immediately into the hand s of your applicants and sort of remove your staf f from needing to compare lists and so on So getting that information quickly to our students .
Agent: And we'll go into preview here, but I'll take a quick pause to if we have
Speaker 6: Any questions from an email perspective here.
Agent: Does that form data just stay in Marketing Cloud or does it go back to the [PRODUCT-3] as well?
Agent: You could you could push it back out.
Agent: All right.
Agent: Any other questions?
Agent: This is just me showing you the dynamic Content piece here of the email. So we have our process.
EndUser: Go ahead. Yeah, so piggybacking on [PERSON-9]'s question there. So is it a big
Agent: Process to push that data back to the [PRODUCT-3]?
Agent: Like would it be a lot on IT?
Agent: No, it's going to tap into that synchronization between both the [PRODUCT-3] and marketing cloud. So I think upfront, it's just making sure you have on the [PRODUCT-3] those fields where that data should be pushed to.
EndUser: And then it'll sink over on the cadence
Agent: That you set with the native connector. Okay.
Agent: So hopefully [PERSON-9], that makes your life a little easier there if we're pushing back D.A. into the [PRODUCT-3].
Agent: Great. So, you know, here we have [PERSON-16] here. We know that she's a freshman applicant. So, you know, from a dynamic [PRODUCT-2] perspective, she's seeing that [PRODUCT-2] directly for that type of student.
Agent: Whereas [PERSON-17] here, we have as a transfer applicant, so they're seeing a completely sort of dynamic [PRODUCT-2] as part of their email experience. What I didn't mention for dynamic [PRODUCT-2] is that it's flexible here.
Agent: We can either apply dynamic content.
Agent: To a specific image or as you see here to certain portions of our email or the entire email itself So some flexibility here to have one template to reach different types of audiences .
Agent: And walking through those different components here, my goal was to at least show you how quickly and easily we can start to build our email [PRODUCT-2] here.
Agent: And again, the clicks not Code approach, drag and drop functionality, no need to dig into [LAW-1] for our emails here.
Agent: All right, so where we're moving into now is the journey component of [PRODUCT-1]. This is going to largely be equivalent to your engagement studio in Part.
Agent: We will walk through an example here of the different components that our journeys entail. But really, the message here is around automation.
Agent: How do we start to remove any manual processes?
Agent: Whether it's adapting the experience for our students and ensuring that we're moving them or connecting them to that next journey that makes sense for where they're at in their particular applicant journey here or switching our communications channel here.
Agent: So we'll touch on that here in a second. As we go through journeys here, what I wanna highlight is that these can be as simple or as sophisticated as we need them to be.
Agent: Simple meaning, perhaps it's a traditional trip we're communicating through a single channel More sophisticated, perhaps we're introducing new channel s that we wanna communicate with our students wit h or adapting the journey based off of how they engag e or not engage with a specific communication And these are completely flexible, the journeys themselves We've seen customers, I'm thinking of your yield lead right, having that nurture built out for those I believe you said it was [DATE-11] or s o where someone is sort of in that limbo period, if you will, from an admit to enroll.
Agent: It might be sort of a simple push to apply sort of journey that you're building here or using journeys to transition them to their points of contact at the different colleges or schools at WT here.
Agent: So very flexible from an automation [ORG-7] So I went ahead and started to build out a journey for us to work off of for [DATE-1].
Agent: This is going to operate like a Workflow similar to what you're used to from the engagement studio side. What I want to highlight are a few different components here.
Agent: These green icons means how do we get someone into a journey?
Agent: How do we automate that process?
Agent: That could be because of a segment that we built within the platform. It could be because of an API.
Agent: So a certain action was taken on a different system and we have that connected to Marketing Cloud we can use that API event as a trigge r to add someone onto our journey It could be because someone filled ou t one of those forms that you saw, or perhaps an [ORG-13] form And building off of that [ORG-16] that we have with this [PRODUCT-3], we can als o start to listen for a specific fiel d to be updated or populated with data on the CRM sid e and use that to automatically add [NORP-1] e onto a relevant journey So some flexible options here for how how we get someone into a journe y.
Agent: Where you start to see some differentiation, I would say with engagement studio is the ability to start to incorporate different channels. whether again, that's going to be email.
Agent: If you decide to tap into the SMS component of [PRODUCT-1], an opportunity here to engage through the SMS component of [PRODUCT-1], push notifications, in-app messages, or even the future advertising is that area that you wish to explore, automatically adding someone to an ad audience as part of that journey component here.
Agent: I did want to mention I was doing some research around [ORG-17].
Agent: And if you decide to stick with [ORG-17] for the once many the broadcast component, they do have a way to connect that into [PRODUCT-1] so that we can do those once many broadcast SMS through [ORG-17].
Agent: So no need SMS if you don't want to go on stick with [ORG-17] here.
EndUser: To switch to the Marketing Cloud
Agent: So they want to make that call out for you. I was going to be one of my questions, so thank you very much. Of course, yeah. Sort of the next step here is these orange icons.
Agent: This is where that automation power starts to come into play here. It could be as simple as adding wait time in between when [PRODUCT-2] is being sent out. It could be something like a decision point.
Agent: Let's look at a specific field to determine what that next step is for an applicant in our journey.
Agent: It could be also listening to their behavior, that they click an email, that they not click, that they open the email, that they not open the email.
Agent: Based off of that behavior, we can start to split them out onto these different branches of our Workflow to adapt automatically the experience that we're delivering to our constituents.
Agent: Also an opportunity here to tap into some [ORG-26] testing as well. Whether it's testing a new channel, whether it's testing different email communications or versions of an email, [ORG-26] is what you can do with injuries here.
Agent: Also opportunities to automate certain actions on the [PRODUCT-3] side, whether that's updating a specific field on your contact records, you know, adding someone onto a campaign on the [PRODUCT-3] side, opening a case, I know task was something that was key in terms of your processes [DATE-1].
Agent: So as part of your journeys, opportunities here to create a task for an admissions counselor perhaps to take some action as part of that lecture. any touch point here .
Agent: And before I touch on the [PRODUCT-4] components here, just want to highlight at a very high level, how it all comes together here, right?
Agent: So for this example journey, we're sending off an initial email, we're waiting [DATE-11], the second email will go out, we'll wait [DATE-16], we'll check against that enrollment status.
Agent: Is someone enrolled or registered, I believe, was another status that you equate to enrolled there?
Agent: You know, that they enroll, great, let's automatically remove them from the journey. We don't need to communicate with them. From that, your staff doesn't need to take any action to remove them either.
Agent: If they didn't enroll, then you know what?
Agent: Let's keep communicating. Let's keep driving that interest, keeping them engaged, to hopefully get them to that enrollment point there. That takes me to these [ORG-16] here.
Agent: These are the [PRODUCT-4] components that you can tap into as part of the journey experience here. A few different options. options here that could be [ORG-17] or what we refer to a s then time optimization.
Agent: So when we think about elevating th e applicant experience from our marketing communication s perspective, it means reaching students with the righ t message at the right time.
Agent: This is where [ORG-17] is a componen t you can tap into where we can send this first initial emai l depending on where you want to place it in the journey directl y to each individual constituents at th e exact moment that they're most likely to click an email or open that [PERSON-26] And it's going to do this at scale for each of your different constituent s. So for me, over time, [ORG-19] may recognize that I tend to click your emails at 10 A M. For [PERSON-2], that might be 8 A M. For [PERSON-16], that might be 6 A M. It's going to adapt this experience for each individual constituent a nd reach me at that point where I'm most likely to engage that [PERSON-26] The other two options here, what that's going to do is split out your journey constituent into different types of segments.
Agent: So this is going to touch into sort of that engagement scoring that I was speaking through earlier here. So for example, one of those options is a scoring split.
Agent: So with Marketing Cloud, we're going to automatically segment your constituents based off of their likelihood to click an email.
Agent: We're going to deem someone as most likely to click all the way down to least likel y to click . When you incorporate these components into your journeys, you're gonna build out these different branches.
Agent: And these are insights that your staff can start to tap into to build out that experience for a particular constituent.
Agent: So when we think about maximizing the time that we have for our constituents, this is those insights that can help us determine what's that next best touch point that we should include in our journey.
Agent: So if someone's most likely to click an email, you know what, let's make sure that first touch point is going to be. going to be an email.
Agent: If someone's least likely to click an email, then let's move the conversatio n to a different channel, or perhaps you want to prioritize those types of students fo r admissions counselors to have that more direct offline Outreach .
Agent: That's going to be the scoring split.
Agent: The frequency split is going to operate in a similar manner where we do segment out your constituents, but rather than looking and considering likelihood to engage in email, we're looking at overall level of saturation.
Agent: So it's someone oversaturated or under saturated. And I was thinking that this might be helpful in that interim period. Those [DATE-13], that met someone is from an admitted to an enrolled, tapping into this component here to adapt.
Agent: Experience and reach your constituents on those channels that they're mos t responsive to during that time period .
EndUser: So on the email click split, if the student clicks on the email and opens it, then does the other items end up happening or does it not?
Agent: Do you mean by other items kind of this a sequence that yep so it'll automatically you know push them into that particular path
EndUser: Or branch of the workflow?
EndUser: So say that we do no matter what.
Agent: All of them get the email
EndUser: And depending on the opening of the email or nonopening of the email during a certain period of time, then can either a text or the text message
Agent: Be added at that point?
Agent: Good question. Let me backtrack a little here. So when we're thinking about steps, right, and sort of what that next touch point is going to be, let me include this
EndUser: Engagement split.
Agent: Ok No, no, this is perfect because it gives me a time to correct myself actually.
Agent: So when we were talking about pushing someone onto the next step, right, should they receive this next email, that's where you would use that engagement split. That's more of in the moment.
Agent: Did they click this first initial email?
Agent: Yes or no?
Agent: And then we pushed them onto the appropriate path based off of that engagement. The [PRODUCT-4] component here, this is going to look more historically at a constituent's typical type of engagement. So over time.
Agent: Is someone most likely to click emails or are the least likely to click emails So this is where we take more of a holistic historical analysis
EndUser: Or embed that type of historical analysis within her journey . Okay, that makes more sense because we know for a fact that like we'll send an emissions decision by email, they get it in two places.
EndUser: They get it on their portal, the minute the decision is made. And then they also get an email when everything is ready to go out the residency decision their ID number and their email is all generated.
EndUser: And then we will still have students that will not check their portal or open that email. And so then our next step is that the emissions counselor has to either give them a call or a text message.
EndUser: To actually even tell them that they've got admitted because we don't even know if they're opening their mail to find out if they have an admissions decision . So unfortunately, we have to make sure that they're doing something
Agent: In order to make sure that they even understand that they're admitted to the university. Absolutely. And that was sort of the experience I had as well. I was always excited when our decisions went out.
Agent: And for those, you know, for different applicants, I would keep a closer eye on for on some, for example, and just make sure that they open their admissions letter and if they did it, you know, that was sort of a red flag for me.
Agent: It's like, are we, did they deposit somewhere else?
Agent: Or, you know, are we not top of mind for them at that moment?
Agent: So, you know, to your point, [GPE-4], you know, why wait?
Agent: You know, wait for them to check the decision.
Agent: If we know that they're not likely to engage in email, then let's just have that conversation offline and sort of start to save some of that time where we could convert them to that next step in the process here.
Agent: So opportunities here to either approach that either way.
Agent: So it's flexible for you, whether you want to send out the emails first and then wait for their behavior, or if we want to include sort of this layer here and start to analyze how, you know, what's their historical type of engagement?
Agent: What's that best initial touch point that we should have for it?
EndUser: And that is a definite improvement on making sure that we instead of having to do everyone every single time, on what's needed.
Agent: Breaking it up based That would save us time and energy.
EndUser: So.
Agent: Yeah, and it helps it helps your admissions counselors as well prioritize those students where they need more of that direct sort of high touch sort of approach to their experience.
Agent: What I want to quickly move into as well, I wanted to address that challenge that you all had around difficulties identifying effectiveness of your sort of different efforts here.
Agent: One of those ways that I wanted to highlight is through the journey analytics themselves. So what you're seeing here are what we refer to as inline analytics at each of the different stages of our journey.
Agent: This is a sort of dummy thing.
Agent: That I use for this email send here for this journey but it gets the point across So different layers of insights that you can start to [ORG-25] e as part of your journey effort here For emails that you build into journeys you can simply click into thos e and see your sort of high leve l deliverability information opens, clicks, how many people receive our emails We can adjust our timeframe there .
Agent: We can also start to see here in the bottom a quick at a glance view how many people received our email. And in this case, you see this little trophy icon there.
Agent: Something I didn't mention is that for journeys here, you can start to set some top level goals here.
Agent: So when we think about the effectiveness of our efforts, we can start to set specific definitions for what our journey goals are.
Agent: For this one, I've set our goal of wanting [PERCENT-1] of anyone that enters this journey to come. for it off of that journey .
Agent: You What this is telling me here is that after our first initial email, we waited to days and we can see that roughly a third of those individuals that we communicated through email converted off of that first initial email and met the criteria for our goals.
Agent: So when you think about our broader efforts here, you know, where should we spend our time focused on, right?
Agent: On one hand, this is telling you what's working well, what's not working well. And as part of your journeys, what's not working well, that's an opportunity.
Agent: For your staff to really spend their time focused on those specific points in the journey where w e need to put a bit more attention, perhaps it's refreshing our content, perhaps it's, you know experimenting, introducing a new channel as part of that journey step .
Agent: And this all runs sort of in the background for you here. So no need for your staff to pull a report and so on to surface this up for you. It's done all automatically for you behind the scenes.
Agent: So really what we're seeing there is just different ways that we can accelerate the applicant experience, right?
Agent: A lot of what you saw was being able to adapt the experience based off of their historical behavior or their end-to-moment behavior.
Agent: Did they click?
Agent: Did they open an email?
Agent: What action did they take?
Agent: But also ways here to also automate, you know, that offline Outreach as well. So, um, publications. I know that's also important for you. That's something that is coming to mind here that I didn't cut. [PERSON-17] Yet .
Agent: There's an opportunity here as part of journeys here to drop individuals perhaps onto a campaign on the [PRODUCT-3]. So some customers that print mailing or publications is a key sort of touchpoint for their constituents.
Agent: The way they automate that is by adding sort of specific individuals onto a campaign on the [PRODUCT-3] as a list and then sending that out to their in-house sort of.
Agent: A print shop or an external vendor that' s either working with When you think about who should receive sort of specific type s of publications, I know that that can sometimes get expensive So you can start to tap into your journeys her e and ensure that only those that need to receive a prin t communication is actually receiving it So just an opportunity here to perhaps save some dollar s in terms of budgets .
Agent: I know that there are certain communications that you all send that everyone has to receive.
Agent: Great, not a problem, but for those where we want to be a bit more intentional of who we're sending communications to, that's also a way that you can automate that with insurance.
Agent: All right, so that brings me here to reporting and analytics and some of the different options that you have available to you beyond just those journey analytics that you saw.
Agent: So let's go give me a second here to log in. This is the Security of our platform here where you know it times out, it logs you out automatically when you're not actively using that window.
Agent: So apologies for that. Just give me [TIME-3] here.
Agent: So from an analytics perspective, one of the options available to you are AI driven analytics here. So again, an opportunity for you to tap into [PRODUCT-4] driven insight here.
Agent: What you're seeing on your screen is a high level dashboard of the different areas that our [FAC-1] can help surface up insights for you. So we're looking at our broader database here within the specific dashboard.
Agent: From an insights perspective, this is all running behind the scenes for you and in terms of areas that are [PRODUCT-4] is surfacing up insights for you That could be our broader database, how likely are they to engage with an email Are they highly likely?
Agent: Are they loyalists to our email or are they least likely ?
Agent: This is a way to start to see how your broader database is trending in terms of your different channels, and specifically with email and things like push notifications. Some insights around when to send those ad hoc communications.
Agent: You know, what days of the week, time of day is most effective to send out our communications. Insights around our broader database level of saturation.
Agent: So this is a quick at a glance view to start to see, are we oversaturating our constituents with communications?
Agent: That we start to see, you know, most of our database leaning into that saturation category, saturated category, excuse me. You know, that's a moment.
Agent: For us to take a pause, revisit our strategy and ensure that we're not over-communicatin g with our constituents there . [ORG-30] can also surface up insights for you around your subject lines.
Agent: You know, how are things like punctuation, specific phrasing, tones, how does that impact our email engagement?
Agent: Um, insights around [PRODUCT-2] selection.
Agent: So if you're reusing sort of imagery or specific banners across different email communications, our [PRODUCT-4] can help you understand what are those high performing banners that high performing imagery that's actually leading to certain actions for that our constituents are taking in there.
Agent: So for that next communication, you know, perhaps you want to use sort of our top performing banner that that's most effectively driving constituents across our holistic email sends .
Agent: The last bit I want to highlight for you from an [PRODUCT-4] driven insight perspective is anomalies. So throughout [DATE-16], you're gonna have multiple email sends, multiple campaigns running simultaneously.
Agent: It may be difficult at times to really keep track of all of those campaigns and be able to intervene in a time-efficient manner here.
Agent: This is an opportunity to have our [FAC-1] actually flag anomalies for you across all of those different sends that you have that are running simultaneously.
Agent: That could be an unusually high unsubscribe rates or a low open rates or the reverse Perhaps there's a [ORG-26] where we're seeing very high engagement Our AI is gonna flag those types of anomalies for yo u so that you can either understand and interven e in those broader campaigns that perhaps are underperformed .
Agent: So again, our [FAC-1] gives you those broader database level views. And let's go back here.
Agent: And what I'll last wrap up with from an analytics and reporting perspective are out of the box dashboards that are available with the platform itself. We'll give this a second to load here.
Agent: And what these are three built dashboards for you that are going to highlight your top level email performance here. So your usual deliverability analytics will give us a second.
Agent: Your high level view around engagement or open rates are clicked to open rates. Our email performance here. So looking at everything from a funnel perspective from send all the way down to clicks.
Agent: And we'll give this a second here.
Agent: And once this loads, you'll also be able to see sort of your top and bottom performing journeys as part of your different efforts here. So again, these are all pre-built dashboards for you. No need to customize these.
Agent: You know, you can drill down by specific dates, a specific business unit or workspace or a specific campaign that you're running within your particular business unit.
Agent: So a few different ways here to drill down into the effectiveness of your communications and really understand what's working, what's not working, so that we can optimize our efforts. I know that's a lot to cover here.
Agent: I'm going to take a sip of water, but if you any questions from an analytics and reporting perspective that y'all have.
Agent: What about any questions,
EndUser: Feedback, overall from what you all saw [DATE-1]?
EndUser: I think one of the things that I'm still would like to see is how would you make sure a publication was sent out, whether it's a search piece, a postcard, a flyer, a brochure. to know that it hit
Agent: On the track correctly and was sent out. Yeah, so that that's going to bring me back to our journey piece there. So.
Agent: I'm gonna make the, I remember you all mentioned, you have your in-house print, correct?
Agent: So that's where that adding individuals onto campaign is gonna help you build that list.
Agent: So if someone drops into that campaign that that's synced over to the [PRODUCT-3] there, you'll see who, at least within our journey, reached that step to receive a specific publication. That list ultimately would get shared out for you.
Agent: Your in-house print shop And
EndUser: In terms of track, are y'all tracking who was if someone received it or just that they were said something ?
EndUser: That they were sent something. We document that on the students rec students record
Agent: As well to make sure that then we pull them out of the next poll of that of that publication material. That it. Yeah, so I would say.
Agent: For customers that have that in-house print shop, we usually see them go this route where they add them onto the campaign on the [PRODUCT-3] side.
EndUser: And that kind of serves as your list of who should have been sent a publication. And that all surfaces
Agent: Back onto that contact record. OK. And so then it can be exported to the student record and then removed out of the campaign for the next cycle. Correct, yeah, so you wouldn't need to.
Agent: I'm assuming [PERSON-9] please correct me if I'm wrong here.
Agent: Are y'all displaying the campaign list, related list on the contact record [DATE-1]?
Agent: Yes, we are.
Agent: Okay, so because you're already doing that [GPE-4], you know, you wouldn't need to at least surface up who received what that campaign will be listed already for you in the contact record in terms of removing them from receiving that publication and sort of the next round.
EndUser: It's just sort of adjusting your filter logic there and sort of what list ultimately
Agent: Gets sent back to your to your in house. Perfect. Just wanted to make sure that we can still track that and keep an eye on it.
EndUser: Yep, and hopefully
Agent: This is one of those automated ways here where you're not comparing a lot of lists here. Thanks.
Agent: One of our feedback, do you have any other reactions or thoughts on you see ways for this to improve or you know, any initial thoughts?
EndUser: I mean, yeah, of course, because we all love [PRODUCT-1] and sales force in general. So I mean, yeah, I think we'll, I think next up for us definitely will be talking a little bit more in depth.
EndUser: And I know we've probably got a few things to iron out with, with IT and budget.
Agent: And I don't have any further questions, though, from this.
Agent: Well, I'll plan to sample back with you maybe in a couple
EndUser: Of [DATE-13] and see where things
EndUser: Stand and see how I can best support you on the floor.
EndUser: Is that sound OK?
EndUser: Yeah, I do have a question. I do have a question, [PERSON-2]. On the on. I know that you talked about different groups having a specific pay price in order to add different into different groups.
EndUser: Since admissions kind of does the whole journey all the way up until registration.
EndUser: So if we do so say that we also cover like new student orientation in our materials and we also cover housing information in our materials, both in print and in email and in text, that can just stay within our one journey correct or can can stay within our containment.
EndUser: I guess is what my question is like the. the
Agent: Pricing range. Like we wouldn't have to have different models for those as well. Correct. Yeah, even though it's different schools that you're potentially sending
EndUser: Marketing information to, you wouldn't need to list this unit. You could keep the containers how you do now. Okay.
EndUser: Well, I guess, [PERSON-9], on your end, is that similar to what we're going to do with the colleges, or do the colleges have to have their own individual ones as well if we decide to start helping them with their process?
EndUser: Because I know [ORG-34]Speaker 6: Kind of has their own, but would that be rolled into admissions since that's the secondary process?
Speaker 6: That's going to depend somewhat on stuff like whether or not you want to share [PRODUCT-2] with them. and stuff like that.
Speaker 6: If they're in the same business unit, you can share [PRODUCT-2] with them, which may or may not be a good thing. And whether, I mean, how much access they'll where
EndUser: Have to your stuff is kind of you'll make that decision and stuff. So it'll have to be a cost versus access kind of decision on that.
Agent: It could work either way. Okay. I just didn't know if we had that, if we had flexibility in that sense.
Agent: Yeah, that's definitely is up to you all on how you all want to give people access and in which units and what not.
EndUser: It. The architecture
Agent: That helps. Thank you.
Agent: Well, other questions.
EndUser: There's no early today and then I'll plan
Agent: We can cut it a little
Agent: To circle back
Speaker 6: To the group in [DATE-16] and check in and
EndUser: We can go from there. Thank you, [PERSON-2].
