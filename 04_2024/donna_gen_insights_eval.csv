"You will be presented with a transcript of a sales call between a seller/sales representative and a customer. The transcript can be noisy and contain several mistakes, e.g. when both speakers are speaking simultaneously. Only the raw transcript will be provided and not the Speaker IDs, so you will have to identify the seller and the customer in the conversation in order to perform your task.

Your job is to read the transcript carefully and accurately answer a few questions regarding the prospect of the deal being discussed, e.g. customer sentiment, concrete next steps, mentions of competitors, or any blockers from closing the deal. Construct your response using only the information contained in the call transcript. If you are unable to find sufficient evidence to answer a given question, say so in the response rather than conjecturing beyond what’s evident from the call transcript.

Make sure your response is direct, concise and professional. Refrain from using redacted PIIs (e.g. [ORG-1], [PERSON-2]) in your response and use generic terms such as “seller”, “customer”, “seller’s product” and “customer’s boss” as much as possible. Only use the specific naming convention ([PERSON-1]) when there are other individuals mentioned apart from seller/customer that are worth noting.

Avoid using pronouns in your response when possible. If you have to, use they/their/them.

Questions:
1. Does it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?
2. What were the top concerns the customer had about our product?
3.  What were the topics most discussed around our competitors?

""Oh, good.

How are you?

I'm okay. Thank you for asking.

Good.

I was just trying to check in.

I think a merit factors had spoken to [ORG-6] in the past and I just wanted to circle back and understand what you guys were doing [DATE-1] if you had a [PRODUCT-1] or if you had any digital initiatives [DATE-6] that you were working on.

Yeah, we're in pipeline deals. So it's been okay overall just because we have a small cell team. I was on [ORG-6] at my previous company, so I completely, yeah, I know about [ORG-6].

Yeah. Oh great. Okay. See you now.

Did you have a good experience using when you were using it?

I was on it first. I'm sorry.

Did you have a good experience when you were using it?

Say your old place.

Yeah, yeah. I think the only comment that I would make is that I couldn't run my only course. I didn't have to do that. It was a bit complicated. So I have a marketing officer do that.

Yeah.

And that was it. I mean, from a perspective of this development, it was relatively easy to put notes, C notes, tags, to some extent, just update information, do searches.

And I think most important was just being able to check your notes.

Sure. Yeah, no, I mean, that's I think the number one thing.

So that was relatively easy. You know, writing reports was a whole different matter.

It's the. Yeah.

And so you guys are using pipeline deals now?

Is that what you were you were mentioning?

Yeah, so when it came over, they didn't really believe in a CRM basis, the business involvement person should be able to track their own notes, just provide information as they come in.

And oftentimes we have an admin assistant compile folders for the sake of, you know, issuing documents.

Yeah.

So they didn't look at our database, nor did they care about the notes. I thought that was kind of strange because I wanted the ability to be a bit more transparent with deals that we're working on.

In the event we have duplicates, I want to know who's working on what, what deals have been submitted.

Yeah. Yeah.

Also a little summary if needed in terms of who they've been working with speaking to with the update and status of each, you know, account that comes in.

Oftentimes that helps us because we want to know how do you keep track of people if you don't really have a CRM?

So they agreed and they started this [PRODUCT-2] line deal. It's not like [ORG-6], but well, I shouldn't say it's not like [ORG-6], there are similarities.

It's not as sophisticated as [ORG-6], but it does hold no hope, which is most important. We can see our nodes, probably not as easily as in [ORG-6] because you can't take it at a quick glance.

You just have to continue to click, click all the way down to the bottom of the page if you want to see all your nodes.

Sure.

And then you have to be very specific in terms of searches. So if you mistype [PERSON-5], for instance, and then you search [PERSON-5] again, you probably won't find him because it was just typed in the first place.

So it's really hard to do searches based on company name unless everything was done accurately in the database in the first place.

But considering most of our videos don't use it as often as they should, we didn't feel the need to improve or make any type of changes.

Sure. No, I hear you that that's super valuable context and I appreciate that.

Yeah, people are not using it religiously and until they fully understand the importance of data entry and updating info, I don't see the need to, you know, go into [ORG-6].

Mm-hmm sure.

Don't never use it.

So you guys aren't enforcing that all as kind of as long as they get it done then it doesn't really matter what the outcome is or well not what the outcome is but how they get there so much.

Yeah, correct.

Yeah. No, I hear you that that's super, that's super interesting. I appreciate you. You give me that background there. Um, well, you know, the reason that

I don't know if that will change, but it won't change anytime in the near future. I mean, I would check that in [DATE-7] or two.

No, no, I hear you. That's good. Good to know. But still, I was reaching out because [PERSON-6]. She's a counter director for you guys.

She was wondering if maybe you could meet for maybe [TIME-1] just for an intro. I think a lot of what you're mentioning is really valuable for her to hear, especially her.

You've given that you have experience with [ORG-6] already.

Is she in celebration?

And it's, oh, she's not. She could give you a phone call or a Zoom call.

Oh, you may zoom in. Also, when you say me, I am an athlete student, physical.

Yeah. No, she will be out there [DATE-8], I think, or [DATE-9], which of course we could, you know, plan something around that.

But yeah, I just wanted to see if you could do maybe a Zoom intro with her for [TIME-2] in [DATE-10].

Yeah, I'm going to be frank with you. I know for a fact we're not going to make any changes.

Ok. Yeah, no, I hear.

Yeah, this is not a question. No one's using it as this. If they're using it, it's really limited info that's been inputted into our [PRODUCT-1]. Not being enforced, nor does management care.

Yeah. Yeah. No, I hear you. And even given that, I think it would still be worthwhile for her to get to introduce you.

And even if it's okay with you, like going into this understanding that there's no changes on your income anytime soon, it's more of like an introduction to educational kind of connection.

I don't think it's going to be good use of her time, but if you want, you can call [PERSON-7] at corporate office.

Okay.

She's our chief marketing director. She makes these type of decisions.

Okay.

I'm on the business development side, so oftentimes I just communicate with our [ORG-11]'s and figure out what's in the pipeline.

Sure.

What was [PERSON-8]'s last name?

I'm sorry, I missed that.

[PERSON-9], F-A-R-R-E-L-L.

Sparrow?

Oh, got you. Okay.

Yeah, you can call the corporate office and she may take your call.

All right. Yeah.

I truly don't know. But since she's in charge of marketing, material, she might have some influence, especially because she's sitting at corporate office to tell our CEO we need to make changes.

Okay.

But to be frank, we're not. And I highly doubt [PERSON-7] would have too much of a say in this, but you can try.

Okay. All right. Well, I, hey, look, I appreciate all that background. Enjoy it. And at a minimum, it was great to meet you and chat with you [DATE-1].

But I hope you have a good rest of your day and thank you again.

The customer is currently using the seller's product, [PRODUCT-2], but they find it less sophisticated and more difficult to search for information.
2. The customer's top concern is the lack of enforcement and management care for data entry and updating information in the seller's product. They mentioned that most of their videos don't use it as often as they should and they don't see the need to improve or make any type of changes.
3. By the end of the call, the customer seemed to be neutral about the deal. They made it clear that they are not planning to make any changes in the near future and that the seller's product is not being used to its full potential. However, they were open to an introduction call with the seller and a counter director at the company. The customer also suggested that the seller reach out to the chief marketing director to try to make changes, but they were not optimistic about the chances of that happening.","1. The customer expressed dissatisfaction with their current solution ([PRODUCT-2]) in comparison to the seller's product ([ORG-6]). They highlighted issues such as the lack of transparency, difficulty in running reports, and challenges with data entry. However, they did acknowledge some similarities between the seller's product and their current solution. Overall, it seems the customer preferred the seller's product ([ORG-6]) over their current solution ([PRODUCT-2]).

2. The top concerns expressed by the customer that could prevent the deal from closing include:

Dissatisfaction with the current solution's lack of transparency, difficulty in running reports, and challenges with data entry.
A lack of enforcement regarding data entry and updates, leading to limited and unreliable information in their current solution ([PRODUCT-2]).
Resistance to change and skepticism about making any changes in the near future, as management does not prioritize or enforce the use of a CRM.
3. The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call seems hesitant and pessimistic about the possibility of making changes in the near future. Despite expressing interest in an introduction with another individual ([PERSON-6]), the customer clearly stated that they were not going to make any changes to their current solution ([PRODUCT-2]). They also redirected the seller to contact [PERSON-7], the chief marketing director, suggesting a lack of decision-making authority on their part regarding CRM solutions. Overall, the customer sentiment appears lukewarm, with little optimism for immediate changes or commitments to explore alternatives.","1. The customer had a mixed sentiment about the seller's product versus their competitor, [ORG-6]. The customer acknowledged the ease of using [ORG-6] for specific tasks like putting notes, C notes, tags, and updating information but mentioned that writing reports was difficult and required a marketing officer's help. In contrast, the customer expressed that their current product, [PRODUCT-2], was not as sophisticated as [ORG-6] and had issues with usability, particularly in viewing notes and conducting searches. This suggests a preference for [ORG-6]’s ease of use in certain areas but does not indicate a clear overall preference due to the customer's commitment to their current solution.

2. The top concerns that might prevent the deal from closing included:

The current business practices and management's attitude towards CRM systems: The customer mentioned that their organization did not believe in a CRM system's necessity and preferred manual tracking and information compilation.
The lack of enforcement and importance placed on using the CRM system effectively within the customer's organization: The customer noted that most of their colleagues do not use the CRM system as often as they should, leading to a lack of interest in making any changes or improvements to the system.
3. The customer sentiment regarding the deal by the end of the call was negative towards making any changes in the near future. The customer was frank about the improbability of their organization making changes to their current CRM system or practices, citing that management does not enforce its use nor cares about the CRM system's data quality. This sentiment indicates a low likelihood of the customer's organization being interested in adopting or switching to a new CRM solution offered by the seller.",Model 1,Model 1,Model 1,
"You will be presented with a transcript of a sales call between a seller/sales representative and a customer. The transcript can be noisy and contain several mistakes, e.g. when both speakers are speaking simultaneously. Only the raw transcript will be provided and not the Speaker IDs, so you will have to identify the seller and the customer in the conversation in order to perform your task.

Your job is to read the transcript carefully and accurately answer a few questions regarding the prospect of the deal being discussed, e.g. customer sentiment, concrete next steps, mentions of competitors, or any blockers from closing the deal. Construct your response using only the information contained in the call transcript. If you are unable to find sufficient evidence to answer a given question, say so in the response rather than conjecturing beyond what’s evident from the call transcript.

Make sure your response is direct, concise and professional. Refrain from using redacted PIIs (e.g. [ORG-1], [PERSON-2]) in your response and use generic terms such as “seller”, “customer”, “seller’s product” and “customer’s boss” as much as possible. Only use the specific naming convention ([PERSON-1]) when there are other individuals mentioned apart from seller/customer that are worth noting.

Avoid using pronouns in your response when possible. If you have to, use they/their/them.

Questions:

What about our product did the customer get excited about or feel would be most impactful?
Did the sales rep ask open-ended questions to identify customer intent? What were they?
Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?
Transcript: ""And thank you for calling [ORG-1] for website development for S1, for accounting and bookkeeping press two, and for CEO, [PERSON-1], [ORG-2] three.

I think we're to pay back something for.

Don't be impressed with it.

Thank you and have [DATE-1].

Thank you.

Yeah, hello.

Hi, [PERSON-2]. This is [ORG-3].

Can you hear me now?

Yeah, let me pass you this call to my cell phone though. Just hold on here.

Yeah, well, Yeah, so how can I help you?

Yes, I'm here.

Yeah.

Well, I mean, are you there?

Ok. I wish we'd been able to schedule the exact same kind of a common small business owner, so I can't just take away what I'm doing to entertain a call.

That's why I expected you to have scheduled something with my calendar because I inconvenienced somebody else in the office here. But nonetheless. I'll take the call because it seems like it's been a challenge to get to this point.

Are you hearing me in real-time or is there a delay?

I can hear you loud and clear.

How can I help?

Okay.

So I

All right.

First of all, I wanted to explore what number are you at?

Don't have a number for

Let me call you back because I'm going to call you for my cell phone because I'm still getting some feedback on my end.

You to reach me out.

What is the number to read to us?

On Jesus Christ.

If you want anything else, I'm happy to help you now.

Okay, well, and you're the only person. Okay, here, we'll try this again. This is like every time I talk, there's an echo on my end.

But you can call it through like a virtual phone, right?

That's like...

So I'm not, I called you twice. So I'm happy to help you.

Do you wanna eat your open [PERSON-3] or talk to you?

Okay. No, I don't even do, that's why I don't want to have the phone call because I don't want to do the email. It's too much email.

So I want to talk about the voicemail drop box, whatever that is, that you could actually just the automatic diet or what does that entail?

What does that look like?

How much does it cost?

And then I also want to talk about what is the best interfacing text communications, text Messaging that interfaces with [ORG-4]. And also I want to know about uploading various databases into [ORG-4].

Okay. So in terms of the pricing for dialer, $[MONEY-1] per year or per year, I can send, there's also a lot of different integrations that you could add on.

In terms of text messaging, there's also lots of different options. So,

Well, let's just stick with it. This is super the automatic dialogue. First thing, let's go to depth on that. Just don't give me higher views. Let's go. a little bit deeper in terms of $[MONEY-2] this.

I mean, tell me a little bit more about it.

Yeah, sure. So you'll be able to make phone calls and receive phone calls through your [ORG-4] [PRODUCT-1]. So any outbound called and inbound called as well.

And that's tied to my existing [ORG-5] phone.

That's tied to my system or how, like, is there a speaker?

I can't explain that detail.

So the dialer would be tied to your [PRODUCT-1]. So it would be calling directly from your instance of [ORG-4].

Okay.

So am I using the speakers on my computer, my laptop?

So, yes, exactly. You're using whatever device you're on. So whether you're using the mobile device or the computer. So, you're using the computer.

So you would be able to play for [TIME-1]. And that would be at a [DATE-2] rate on an [DATE-3] contract.

So let's [DATE-4] contract.

What's your contract?

Yep, exactly. So this would just be added on to your current contract with [ORG-4].

So [DATE-5] on top of my existing contract, or [DATE-6] in... from the date.

Nope, it would be added on to your current contract.

So what is my current contract right now?

I have to pull that up for you. Give me a moment while I get that information. You can also access your contract through your instance of [ORG-4] on your own at any time.

So it looks like your contract is up in [DATE-7]. And you have the dialer on your contract already. So

You're already paying for this.

Okay. And I'm not even using it. Okay.

So right now you have [TIME-2] per month, and you also have access to the premier success plan. And that gives you onboarding guided expert office [TIME-3] and you also have [ORG-4] inbox and our Enterprise edition.

What is the inbox?

Inbox is a tool that allows you to log and track all of your email communication through Outlook or [ORG-6] right on that interface within your [PRODUCT-1]. You can

To email.

Track these. Exactly. And you can also log your availability as well. So if you wanted to replace that with [NORP-1], you would be able to do that too.

Yeah, I have that.

Yes, that's it.

So,

Could you like script that up so and then you can introduce me to that person.

That was able to help me to implement that because I'm trying to ramp up for some contractual work that I'll be doing here coming in [DATE-8].

That will require me to do map emails and phone message text and campaign. And I want to make sure I'm capturing that and working out all the bugs between now and then.

And that you have to be working on a lot. It's good.

So when it goes, when we go live, it's easy.

It's great. It's great. Yeah. So you're actually paying for a program called Premier [PERSON-4]. So I would take advantage of that. So this is an item on your contract. And you're already paying for it.

So they can actually teach you how to do all of this. We don't provide implementation, but we provide in-house training, which is what you're paying for with the Premier Success Plan.

So a better person to speak to would actually see them because my team does not provide any tech support versus simply on the sales team.

So it would be in your best interest to work with them instead of myself.

Yeah.

If you needed to add licenses or upgrades, then I would be your point of view.

And good.

Yeah, of course.

Was that contact information?

I can email you their phone number so that you can reach them directly.

Okay. So then, yeah. And then, so I have the ability to integrate my calendar. And then, again, my [PRODUCT-1].

It's your answer. Yeah, it would be your calendar and you'll be able to use that with [ORG-4] inbox.

What would that look like?

I don't understand how would they see that?

How would somebody, if I received an email through my [PRODUCT-1], would they be able to see my calendar?

Yeah, so that's something that our Premier Success team can walk you through. Like me, that's not, it was in my domain.

And

So what if I have mobile emails from my business, like an info at [ORG-7] and then a vanity page?

Like I said, that's something that our Premier Success team will be able to answer for you.

Okay, and now we have a call feature to do automatic voicemasters drop right call number hit it on the back here and automatically. leave a message once I hit the button, a pre-recorded message.

Yes, you will be able to walk through this with the premier success team.

I'm going to create that email for you now just so that you have the information and you can get in contact with them as soon as possible.

And then first text Messaging is concerned, how does that all work?

So you would need to set up an integration with SMS API.

Smf API.

Yep, so there's things like [PRODUCT-2] and different integrations that you can use so that you can send text messages.

Um, and those are third parties. They're not part of the sales.

Correct.

And then I guess again, the prepare team would be able to give me more guidance on that.

Yep, I just have you an app that is an option that you could look at. I Okay.

You sent me via text, you sent me an email.

Sent you an email.

Okay, I'm waiting for it to come through then.

This isn't something that I would take a look at now. I would set aside some time to look into this as it's not something I would take lightly.

Okay, so then loading various database and into [ORG-4].

That's possible on guessing, right?

You could work with that at a time.

Sleeping boy, I'm not here. I would reach out to the premier success team to ask that question. I don't know.

So, epic shame shows for us. text Messaging app.

So is this the $[MONEY-3] that I paid you guys or is this the other, other third party?

I believe that's the third party. I just gave you the phone number as well to the premier success number toll free so that you can start getting started using that.

Is that in a separate email?

Let's see me in my own.

It's in the same email chain.

Okay, well, I hear I see the link here. I click on the link.

The premier.

Yes,

No.

I don't see that.

So that was our phone number to reach Premier Success.

I see [PERSON-5].

Of the 42503577681. Okay. And you're saying the $[MONEY-3] a month. Okay. So, hey, it's so helpful. Hey, [PERSON-6].

That's one option. I'm sure they could help you explore other options as well, but I would take a look into that. OK.

Ok.

So how about we want to make sure that we're right?

That's not L-Source though,

Correct.

But the 3734709895 is still source number. Okay. Alright. Oh my god.

Yes, that's your Premier Success Plan number. I

Actually have to run to another customer meeting right now, but please make sure you give that Premier Success number a call so that they can help answer all of your questions.

As like I said, you are paying for [ORG-8].

Yes Alexis, I guess you have [TIME-4]. You can listen of your time. And you're my sole source that put the contact in the fails part of it.

Note so your team is actually not assigned a one-on-one sales force representative, which is why you have the premier success plan. So any support that you need, I would recommend reaching out to the premier success team.

If you need to add any licenses or upgrade, then I would be able to support you with that. But I am not your designated contact.

What is the cost for digital license?

So if you wanted an additional license, I would need to look at what your contract is currently set at. Like I said, I do need to run so I can email you that pricing.

Wow. Okay. And then my contact is going to automatically renew in [DATE-8] then.

I'm not sure if your contract is set to auto renewal, but I can let you know once I take a look at your contract once again.

Okay, send me that information. [PERSON-7], thank you. Have [DATE-1].

2. The sales rep did ask some open-ended questions to identify customer intent, such as inquiring about the customer's needs regarding voicemail drop, text messaging, and database uploading. However, due to the chaotic nature of the call and technical difficulties, the questions were not very structured or effective.

3. Overall, the customer seemed somewhat interested in exploring additional features and integrations for their existing product ([ORG-4]), such as automatic voicemail drop and text messaging. However, they also expressed frustration with technical issues and uncertainties about contract details and renewal. The customer's sentiment appeared somewhat mixed, with interest in certain features tempered by concerns about cost and implementation.","1. The customer seemed excited about and felt that the voicemail dropbox feature and the automatic dialer would be most impactful for their business. They expressed interest in understanding how these features work, their costs, and how they could integrate them with their current systems, indicating a strong inclination towards improving their communication processes through these functionalities.

2. The sales representative did ask some open-ended questions to identify customer intent, although not directly highlighted as questions in the transcript. The conversation's nature, where the sales rep inquired about the customer's current use of the product, their needs regarding the dialer, text messaging, and integrating databases, and their contract details, suggests an attempt to understand the customer's requirements and guide them towards solutions. However, specific open-ended questions are not directly quoted in the provided transcript.

3. Overall, the customer seemed to feel that the product could meet their needs, especially with the potential integrations and functionalities discussed during the call, such as the voicemail dropbox, automatic dialer, and text messaging integrations. However, there was also a sense of frustration or missed opportunity, as indicated by the customer's reaction upon realizing they were already paying for a dialer feature they were not using. This suggests that while the product offers features that meet the customer's needs, there might be a gap in the customer's awareness or usage of these features, which the sales representative attempted to address by redirecting them to the premier success team for further assistance.",Model 1,Model 1,Model 1,
"""You will be presented with a transcript of a sales call between a seller/sales representative and a customer. The transcript can be noisy and contain several mistakes, e.g. when both speakers are speaking simultaneously. Only the raw transcript will be provided and not the Speaker IDs, so you will have to identify the seller and the customer in the conversation in order to perform your task.

Your job is to read the transcript carefully and accurately answer a few questions regarding the prospect of the deal being discussed, e.g. customer sentiment, concrete next steps, mentions of competitors, or any blockers from closing the deal. Construct your response using only the information contained in the call transcript. If you are unable to find sufficient evidence to answer a given question, say so in the response rather than conjecturing beyond what’s evident from the call transcript.

Make sure your response is direct, concise and professional. Refrain from using redacted PIIs (e.g. [ORG-1], [PERSON-2]) in your response and use generic terms such as “seller”, “customer”, “seller’s product” and “customer’s boss” as much as possible. Only use the specific naming convention ([PERSON-1]) when there are other individuals mentioned apart from seller/customer that are worth noting.

Avoid using pronouns in your response when possible. If you have to, use they/their/them.

Questions:

1. What were the top concerns the customer had or expressed that would prevent the deal from closing?
2. What are some opportunities where the sales rep could have spent more time understanding the customers needs?
3. Overall, did the customer seem to bring up a lot of our competitor features compared to ours? Were any of them deal-breakers?

Transcript: """"""Actually just got aligned over to [PERSON-10]. I noticed you were on a few evaluations over [DATE-8]. It looks like budget may have been a concern for you.

Just curious if there's anything new for you guys for [DATE-9].

All

Any changes on the business or if it made sense to maybe connect again, kind of take a look at what we're doing [DATE-1].

Right. Gotcha. Well, if I appreciate you keeping me on the list. I'd have to say that right now nothing's really changed for us and we're not quite certain what [DATE-6] will hold for us.

Yeah.

I think probably a lot of folks would say we're saying that, but I don't think it'll be terrible, but we're actually

Okay. Right.

Losing that one teammate on our end, but we may pick up another. in [DATE-15], so it might be another time to reconnect if we have a new team member.

Okay.

I hate to sound like a broken record to just keep me on your list, but...

Yeah, for sure. No, no, no, you're totally fine.

And like I said, I mean, I know typically this is the time where we make those calls and just kind of say, hey, you know, you look before, I'm not sure.

Was it just budget last time or was it more of a timing thing?

I can't really see that deep into it, but we did.

Yeah. Um.

Oh, go ahead, sir.

Oh, no, I was just gonna say I think it was probably more timing. It's just our business books and we're fortunate.

Okay.

It's been really full. And, um, but you know, I think [DATE-10] with all the uncertainty going on, who knows what could happen.

Right. Most definitely. Okay.

I'm going to, and just so I have, is it WMoon at smelterservice.com?

Is that your email still?

That's correct, yeah.

Okay. I'm going to shoot over an email.

I'm also going to include one of my product specialists just so you have our information, not that this is going to change anything and get you to jump on a call with us [DATE-9], but I would like to introduce you to him at some point.

And then we also just rolled out a, it's a new product. I'm not sure if you've heard of it or not. It's called [PRODUCT-1]. So it's more on our starter side.

So when I'm looking at your past evaluations, it looks like you maybe have like five two one two five licenses you were looking at.

What this is, it's kind of our like out of the box, I guess, if you will, solution now, where it's going to have sales, service, marketing all encompassed into the one licensed itself.

Mm-hmm.

So you're not like branching off, getting different applications. And it's also free Implementation too. So everything's done inside internally on your end with our support. And it's no more like the third party Implementation partner.

I'm not sure if you remember that conversation off, but typically that's how we do it on like larger size deals.

But this is just something, again, more like the out of the box, get you kind of up and running with a new [PRODUCT-2], and then it also gives you simple marketing capabilities, as well as like service side of it too.

Gotcha.

So I'll get that over to you.

If it does, like I said, if it's something, hey, you know, I just have a couple of questions on this, or want to learn a little bit more before, [DATE-6], feel free to let us know.

We can always schedule a brief, you know, [TIME-6] call and keep going at it from there. But I'll get that over to you.

And then I'll also, like I said, I'll include [GPE-4] and let them know of our conversation and then. We'll see what's next.

Of Okay, yeah, I appreciate you keeping that in front of me and it's always good to do that periodically to at least keep you in the back of the mind there.

Course.

Yeah, and I don't want to seem to sound come off too pushy here and again. My job is more just like bridge in the gap and I know you know sales force.

Would it make sense to introduce you to him now just so we're like set up enough time beforehand?

We do like a real evaluation or do you want to hold off on even?

An introduction here.

I mean you're fine to introduce them and email. I mean all that's fine.

Ok.

I would not be opposed to any of that. I just at the moment don't have much to offer but you never know things could change.

Ok.

Sure. OK, well, I'll do that and then I'm sure he'll come over the top introduce himself.

Maybe ask, you know, hey, you got [TIME-7] you will have to just call your chat with you and maybe throw some time. But. Other than that, that's all I have for you [DATE-1].

Like I said, just kind of keeping tabs on the end and seeing what's new, but I appreciate you chatting here.

Got it. Yeah, no, awesome. I appreciate it as well. Thanks for reaching out.

""""""[PERSON-2].

Age a long time ago. Sorry, Mr. Call.

All right, man.

How have you been?

Same Not too bad. It's been a pretty hectic season here with like [EVENT-1] and we got [DATE-2] coming up and traveling to my family, my wife's family. So it's all that good stuff this time of year.

How about you?

Here, man. Yeah. Well, traveling holidays, I got coated again. The whole bunch of great.

Oh no.

Yeah, it's all right, so I'm probably to this

How many times have you had COVID previously?

[LOC-1].

The second time?

This is my third time.

Third

I mean, the three timers club.

The rare, the rare breed. You have like, in the basement sleeping, got like soup deliveries down there.

What's your like COVID protocol?

Yeah, it's actually my favorite things. Don't tell my wife this, but it's wonderful because I. I'm not allowed to interact or talk with anybody or see anybody. I just get to kind of just isolate alone for a while.

It's wonderful.

He has some quiet time, just yourself.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

Catch.

I can't be around our children because, you know, I got COVID. I don't want to give them COVID.

Yeah, exactly.

So.

You have to be a good dad and, you know, do your own thing for a little bit.

Yeah. Yeah.

Stay quiet.

How's the, what else?

But it's super busy. I apologize. I haven't we haven't connected in a while.

I know that you've been talking with [PERSON-3] about our upcoming renewal and sent me an email [DATE-3], then he wanted me to reach out to you. So it looks like there are [PERCENT-1] increase on the prices happening.

Yep, for the first time, I'm going to talk to really [PERSON-4]. I just like, I just have like a report that tells me all of the different people who contact my accounts.

And I saw the renewal manager reaching out to, I think it was maybe [PERSON-4] or somebody.

Dr.

And like the renewal manager is pretty much we have Price increase for the first time in [DATE-4], actually. So like [GPE-1], I mean, E went from like 146. Now it's less price of 101.

So we've had price increases across the board and pretty much our renewals team reaches out of customers. But there's no changes. They just impose [PERCENT-1] uptick.

But typically I work with... the customers knowing what they have going on, like typically there's like some type of like future growth that we can kind of capture or they've been interested in like premier success or [FAC-1] in terms of like encrypting your data and that kind of stuff.

So, if there's any kind of initiative, I can kind of align to that and wave it accordingly. This typically what I've seen happen.

Gotcha gotcha. So at this time, I think we're just going to stay put with exactly our renewal. There's some things happening, but I don't want to be preemptive and start changing stuff without it.

I don't want to count my eggs before they, my chickens before they have whatever the phrase is.

So for now we're going to alone, but I was wondering is it possible for us to sign like a multi year thing and wave that [PERCENT-1] Okay.

Yeah. The only really lever to weight of [PERCENT-2] is some type of change in pricing. That's basic. So I mean, I don't, you know, I'm just kind of being proactive because your renewal isn't for [DATE-5].

So.

When you say big things happening, is that something in like [DATE-6], [DATE-7], like how off is big news happening?

It's probably within [DATE-8]. So it's all dependent on a couple of factors.

Got it.

And it's, yeah, it may require us to add more sales people here pretty rapidly. But once again, I don't wanna jinx anything.

So, I'll do what?

Yeah.

I'm gonna go do an analysis and see if there's something we can do. that I may be overlooking if there's a small product or something we can add or whatever it may be. But if not, [PERCENT-1] is fine.

That's just the cost to do business. If you want to send me, I guess we already have the quote, and I'll forward that to [ORG-7].

But I'll take a look on my side and see if there's anything that we need to add or anything we need to do to add a product.

Mm-hmm.

And then I'll be in touch with [PERSON-5].

All right. I will say the one thing, instead of just taking the [PERCENT-3] fee, so getting the same products for [PERCENT-3] extra. They do have premier success.

And right now I have [PERCENT-4] off approvals for [DATE-9], which comes out to [PERCENT-5] of your contract. So basically for the same price, you can get accelerators while I'm coaching premier webinars.

Okay.

It's kind of like, we don't offer the actual kind of paid services of like, here's [TIME-2], this person will go off and build stuff, but we do have people that will actually sit on the call with you for Unlimited amount of time.

So like when you were setting up the [PERSON-6] box or when you were doing any type of like the chat bot or if you wanted to create anything in [ORG-5] for sales or [ORG-8], we actually have experts who that's their job is they are extremely knowledgeable about those subjects.

And what they'll do is they'll actually sit down with you and walk through it with you. So it's kind of like having an additional [ORG-5] admin on your team to troubleshoot.

That's all. That may be, that may be a pretty cool. I'll take a look at what you said, it's called premier success.

I can send you more information on that.

Ok. Yeah, if you could, that'd be great.

I'm trying to think of what are some other small low-hanging fruit that I mean, the goal for me is that you get value, right?

I can provide something in return for that [PERCENT-1] that you can actually use, like CPU, large projects. That's like those type of things that kind of off the table. There is the idea of connecting the data.

Connecting sales force to Zen desk or to QuickBooks. So we do have like a prebuilt sector, which is roughly probably the same price as well.

I believe you said Zen desk would be like totally off the table to have it replaced with some customer mandate.

Is it right?

Yeah, to replace it, but we I do have some weird Zen desk connector that like barely works right now.

Okay.

I think it's the Zen deck. That might be.

Well, the ZenDest connector, so basically what happened is [ORG-5] acquired [ORG-9], which is like the leader in integration.

I think that's when I started reaching out to Chip to see if he would be interested in just knowing about our reusable API platform, like our holiday.

You never responded to me and I was like, okay, I don't want to waste this time. I really just wanted to share some information.

That's like the full blown deal soft, but then they basically developed for small businesses, these like pre-built connectors. So basically you can connect [ORG-5] to [GPE-2], [ORG-5] to [ORG-10] to QuickBooks.

So depending on what other technologies you have in your tech stack, basically they have these pre-built connectors.

The other really cool thing about it is that, I have a program [DATE-10] that I can apply for to get you free implementation.

So like instead of you building it, it's meant for admin to like, it's basically flow. So like when this happens, go, you know, send this, you know, opportunity data into QuickBooks under this object.

But I do have a program as well where I can have [PERSON-7], who's our number one, your soft provider partner. They can actually set it up for you automatically for free.

Thing. Yeah, if you can finish on that as well, that'd be cool.

So those are the two main ideas that I had for you.

Yeah, Rev Intel is like a forecasting kind of analytics tool, which does require some implementation.

If you're anything like the sales team, if they would want to do like prospecting in salesforce, like calling, like kind of like what they use Outreach or sales law for. I'm not that part of the sales strategy.

Now, we've been trying that side of things really fit well with our business because most of our deals are just massive huge deals that require very kind of like personalised touch.

Yeah.

It's almost impossible for the nature of our industry to have kind of like [ORG-10], the [ORG-13] kind of engagements.

Yeah.

It just doesn't really work. However, that may change in the tool case. But there was a revenue tool that you were looking at like an analytics tool.

Yeah, there's an analytics tool called revenue intelligence. And pretty much what it does is our standard dashboards and reports are great, but they are very one-dimensional.

So when you start looking at trends and how we're doing across different times and what changes and all that kind of stuff, we do have an analytics tool built into [ORG-5] if that's a miniatures.

That's definitely one interest. Yeah, that's a huge part of [GPE-3]' is, you know, [DATE-10] have to give on a forecast report, the in-depth report test report.

Attention.

And if there's anything that could step that up, it's fantastic. I'm the sales manager, I'm sorry, the [ORG-5] admin here, but I also run the sales and marketing operations.

So it's part of that is, you know, forecasting and analytics.

Mm-hmm.

You know, finding the story and the numbers.

Yeah.

So if there's any tools that you could recommend that you guys offer out of the box that help sales ops perspective, that's gonna be the most valuable thing.

Yeah. Yeah.

You know, when you bring up that subject, are you using pipeline inspection [DATE-3]?

No, how could, I turned it on.

Pipeline inspection, it's free. OK.

I don't use this, what is pipelines?

Do you remember what is that again?

Okay. Pipeline inspection is like, you know, when you have an opportunity list view and it tells you like, okay, here are the dates, here are the ages. Pipeline inspection takes it to the next level.

It starts introducing the trends. Hey, this was $[MONEY-1]. It just moved to 28. It just moved to five. Or this was a deal that was supposed to close in [DATE-13].

Now is closing in the third or neck. Now is closing [DATE-10]. So it kind of has a little bit of like those. kind of [ORG-10] trends built into it about where things are going to. Yeah.

Gotcha. Yeah, I'm gonna take a note of that. Super valuable. I can't I feel like I've turned it on but I just haven't used it. I gotta go double check It's been crazy over

Yeah. It used to be for Unlimited edition. So basically, you've been an ecosystem long enough.

We probably have seen, we take new innovation, we release it in [ORG-10] for those customers, get their feedback, and then if it does seem like we're sounding like, people should just have this across the board.

They introduce it into Enterprise edition. That is when they will release it to pretty much all our customers. And pipeline inspection is one of them.

So pipeline inspection, I can send you information too, let me make note of that. And again, like that's something that you have available [DATE-3], like no 10% or other products needed, like you can roll that out.

But it's pretty cool in the way that we kind of handle our forecasting as well, to understand like where the risks might be or how we're trending in certain areas.

Yeah, that sounds fantastic. Yes. I think from my perspective, if we were to offset [PERCENT-6] and add a tool, anything that can help with, you know, forecasting analytics sales up stuff would be probably bring most of that.

Yeah.

So if you know, I don't want to take up too much of your time, but if you could just quit the job down a list of products and I can do all the research that you think would be relevant.

It could literally just be as simple as like a bulleted list of the name of the product and I can go out and find it and then.

Now, I'm happy to kind of walk through things. I always prefer to have like a conversation about them anyway, obviously coming from the solution agenda inside.

I love talking about our products and like the ins and outs of it.

Yeah, you were a switch that's here beforehand.

I knew have I.

I think, you know, that's what makes you the probably the most effective sales person we've had at [ORG-5].

It's not that that's a teacher horn a little bit, but you have like a deep understanding of the products, which has been extremely beneficial for us.

No, I appreciate that super.

Yeah, no, absolutely. That's why even like the live chat connector, I was like, actually, we have this and we can kind of connect things in.

And the other part of it, too, is like, I kind of know what are like the big, what are like some of the bigger implementations that you'd have to do versus like lower panging fruit across the board.

I'm going to do like, you have [ORG-8], which I think is like one of the heavier ones, but also heavier return.

Don't forget to subscribe to our channel.

I have like a slide deck. If you want, I get [TIME-3] on and just kind of walk you through.

Almost like they're like one sliders, kind of like a catalog book that kind of goes over like what what people are Looking for like I have everything from like, you know sales AI and like, you know generative E-Mails that your folks can send Unless they're not really doing that kind of stuff and then it doesn't make sense all the way through some of like the you know Revenue intelligence products and and all that kind of stuff.

Yeah, that sounds great.

So if you want to

I don't know what your timeline looks like, but I'm wide open. Either [DATE-10] morning or [TIME-4] [TIME-5] [DATE-10].

Okay.

Possibly actually maybe 3.313482107109186 just to be safe.

Yeah, how about this?

I could do [TIME-6] [DATE-10].

Does that work?

Yeah, that's perfect.

Cool.

What's that?

Let's, uh, I'll, uh, I'll have a couple of slides. I'll walk through just like some different things and you can just can be kind of like the thumbs up. Some kind of like that does pertain to our company.

That doesn't.

Okay, that sounds great.

Cool. In the meantime, I can get you some more information too on like the two things that we did talk about with like the. The connector, it's called [PERSON-8] or also [ORG-10].

[ORG-10] is just one of those things. If you're the only kind of [ORG-5] admin and you want some extra help, that one two me is a no-brainer. But let me get you some more information.

Got it.

Are you using any other tools besides ZenDesk, like I'm using JIRA or anything else that would be relevant to kind of connect data to?

Sorry, say that one more time.

Are using any other kind of tools like ZenDesk or like maybe Jira or QuickBooks that would be helpful in connecting data together?

I know we're using [PRODUCT-1], but I don't know how beneficial it would be to connect that data. The sales force side.

What is [PRODUCT-2] currently?

So we've kind of honed everything in, but most of our impactful pieces of our tech stack now live in [ORG-5] or our [ORG-5] products.

Beautiful.

Then this would be probably, I think, the only one that would bring any value.

Got it.

However, it's so minimal. So like, let me pull up an opportunity real fast.

What I've done is I have a Zen desk like plug-in, I think it's made by ZenDesk, whereas, you know, if you go to an opportunity, there's a tab that I created called ZenDesk, and you click it and it shows all the open tickets for the account.

And it's supposed to sync contacts, but it just doesn't seem to be working very well. Like I have to like trigger a manual.

Got it.

And that's pretty much the extent that we need it for really just keeping contacts up to date.

Got it.

And then if the salespeople needs them in tell what tickets are open. Honestly, I don't think it gets used a lot. We have, you know, four salespeople here and they're all working on super high value big ticket.

So any kind of issue, usually they're already on top of anyway.

Yeah, gotcha. Okay, it sounds like then it's mostly just for one, visibility of what tickets are at that account.

And two, as we created new [PRODUCT-3] in [ORG-5], how that created new [PRODUCT-3] in Zendes and vice versa or edits. All right.

Yep, yep, that's

Do you know how, do you know if people in [GPE-4] might be like, hey, you know what, this isn't really a support issue. This is actually a technology product issue. and they create tickets to [GPE-5]

So then that's Jira, you know, that's relevant to all.

It. Unfortunately, I don't. It sounds like it would be relevant, but it's just not my domain. So I could be making a false statement here.

Yeah. Got it.

One thing comes up often is people submit tickets that turn out to be sales items. I don't know if you have something like that, but I'm not worried if you can. transfer is a notification of some sort.

Yep.

Like it happens, at least once a week, where somebody comes in, basically submitting a ticket asking for a salesperson, basically.

Yeah, that's a great use case as well. I have an integration specialist.

Let me run that by him of like, OK, can we have like a Zen desk, to get or some type of Zen desk item that gets triggered to actually create an opportunity.

It's kind of like for us, when anyone goes in a sales or is in a kind of playing with the back end, if they touch any of their contracts or anything, We get an automatic opportunity that gets created called the web store.

And then that's when I reach out.

You might have got my emails, okay?

I saw you were poking around.

Basically, it's an automatic opportunity that gets created as a placeholder to make sure that I follow up with the customer of like, hey, is there anything that you need?

It sounds like this kind of something similar was then that's like, hey, they actually are looking for sales and not support.

Cool.

How do I notify sales effectively?

Yeah, that sounds awesome.

Cool. Okay. Well, I'll send out in a invite for [DATE-10], [TIME-7], and we'll get chat through a couple of ideas, and yeah, we'll just have our thinking chats on.

Cool, that sounds awesome man, thank you so much.

Cool, yep, you got your autotune [DATE-10], and hopefully you feel better.

Awesome, thanks man, I appreciate it.

That person.""""""","""[PERSON-2].

Age a long time ago. Sorry, Mr. Call.

All right, man.

How have you been?

Same Not too bad. It's been a pretty hectic season here with like [EVENT-1] and we got [DATE-2] coming up and traveling to my family, my wife's family. So it's all that good stuff this time of year.

How about you?

Here, man. Yeah. Well, traveling holidays, I got coated again. The whole bunch of great.

Oh no.

Yeah, it's all right, so I'm probably to this

How many times have you had COVID previously?

[LOC-1].

The second time?

This is my third time.

Third

I mean, the three timers club.

The rare, the rare breed. You have like, in the basement sleeping, got like soup deliveries down there.

What's your like COVID protocol?

Yeah, it's actually my favorite things. Don't tell my wife this, but it's wonderful because I. I'm not allowed to interact or talk with anybody or see anybody. I just get to kind of just isolate alone for a while.

It's wonderful.

He has some quiet time, just yourself.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

Catch.

I can't be around our children because, you know, I got COVID. I don't want to give them COVID.

Yeah, exactly.

So.

You have to be a good dad and, you know, do your own thing for a little bit.

Yeah. Yeah.

Stay quiet.

How's the, what else?

But it's super busy. I apologize. I haven't we haven't connected in a while.

I know that you've been talking with [PERSON-3] about our upcoming renewal and sent me an email [DATE-3], then he wanted me to reach out to you. So it looks like there are [PERCENT-1] increase on the prices happening.

Yep, for the first time, I'm going to talk to really [PERSON-4]. I just like, I just have like a report that tells me all of the different people who contact my accounts.

And I saw the renewal manager reaching out to, I think it was maybe [PERSON-4] or somebody.

Dr.

And like the renewal manager is pretty much we have Price increase for the first time in [DATE-4], actually. So like [GPE-1], I mean, E went from like 146. Now it's less price of 101.

So we've had price increases across the board and pretty much our renewals team reaches out of customers. But there's no changes. They just impose [PERCENT-1] uptick.

But typically I work with... the customers knowing what they have going on, like typically there's like some type of like future growth that we can kind of capture or they've been interested in like premier success or [FAC-1] in terms of like encrypting your data and that kind of stuff.

So, if there's any kind of initiative, I can kind of align to that and wave it accordingly. This typically what I've seen happen.

Gotcha gotcha. So at this time, I think we're just going to stay put with exactly our renewal. There's some things happening, but I don't want to be preemptive and start changing stuff without it.

I don't want to count my eggs before they, my chickens before they have whatever the phrase is.

So for now we're going to alone, but I was wondering is it possible for us to sign like a multi year thing and wave that [PERCENT-1] Okay.

Yeah. The only really lever to weight of [PERCENT-2] is some type of change in pricing. That's basic. So I mean, I don't, you know, I'm just kind of being proactive because your renewal isn't for [DATE-5].

So.

When you say big things happening, is that something in like [DATE-6], [DATE-7], like how off is big news happening?

It's probably within [DATE-8]. So it's all dependent on a couple of factors.

Got it.

And it's, yeah, it may require us to add more sales people here pretty rapidly. But once again, I don't wanna jinx anything.

So, I'll do what?

Yeah.

I'm gonna go do an analysis and see if there's something we can do. that I may be overlooking if there's a small product or something we can add or whatever it may be. But if not, [PERCENT-1] is fine.

That's just the cost to do business. If you want to send me, I guess we already have the quote, and I'll forward that to [ORG-7].

But I'll take a look on my side and see if there's anything that we need to add or anything we need to do to add a product.

Mm-hmm.

And then I'll be in touch with [PERSON-5].

All right. I will say the one thing, instead of just taking the [PERCENT-3] fee, so getting the same products for [PERCENT-3] extra. They do have premier success.

And right now I have [PERCENT-4] off approvals for [DATE-9], which comes out to [PERCENT-5] of your contract. So basically for the same price, you can get accelerators while I'm coaching premier webinars.

Okay.

It's kind of like, we don't offer the actual kind of paid services of like, here's [TIME-2], this person will go off and build stuff, but we do have people that will actually sit on the call with you for Unlimited amount of time.

So like when you were setting up the [PERSON-6] box or when you were doing any type of like the chat bot or if you wanted to create anything in [ORG-5] for sales or [ORG-8], we actually have experts who that's their job is they are extremely knowledgeable about those subjects.

And what they'll do is they'll actually sit down with you and walk through it with you. So it's kind of like having an additional [ORG-5] admin on your team to troubleshoot.

That's all. That may be, that may be a pretty cool. I'll take a look at what you said, it's called premier success.

I can send you more information on that.

Ok. Yeah, if you could, that'd be great.

I'm trying to think of what are some other small low-hanging fruit that I mean, the goal for me is that you get value, right?

I can provide something in return for that [PERCENT-1] that you can actually use, like CPU, large projects. That's like those type of things that kind of off the table. There is the idea of connecting the data.

Connecting sales force to Zen desk or to QuickBooks. So we do have like a prebuilt sector, which is roughly probably the same price as well.

I believe you said Zen desk would be like totally off the table to have it replaced with some customer mandate.

Is it right?

Yeah, to replace it, but we I do have some weird Zen desk connector that like barely works right now.

Okay.

I think it's the Zen deck. That might be.

Well, the ZenDest connector, so basically what happened is [ORG-5] acquired [ORG-9], which is like the leader in integration.

I think that's when I started reaching out to Chip to see if he would be interested in just knowing about our reusable API platform, like our holiday.

You never responded to me and I was like, okay, I don't want to waste this time. I really just wanted to share some information.

That's like the full blown deal soft, but then they basically developed for small businesses, these like pre-built connectors. So basically you can connect [ORG-5] to [GPE-2], [ORG-5] to [ORG-10] to QuickBooks.

So depending on what other technologies you have in your tech stack, basically they have these pre-built connectors.

The other really cool thing about it is that, I have a program [DATE-10] that I can apply for to get you free implementation.

So like instead of you building it, it's meant for admin to like, it's basically flow. So like when this happens, go, you know, send this, you know, opportunity data into QuickBooks under this object.

But I do have a program as well where I can have [PERSON-7], who's our number one, your soft provider partner. They can actually set it up for you automatically for free.

Thing. Yeah, if you can finish on that as well, that'd be cool.

So those are the two main ideas that I had for you.

Yeah, Rev Intel is like a forecasting kind of analytics tool, which does require some implementation.

If you're anything like the sales team, if they would want to do like prospecting in salesforce, like calling, like kind of like what they use Outreach or sales law for. I'm not that part of the sales strategy.

Now, we've been trying that side of things really fit well with our business because most of our deals are just massive huge deals that require very kind of like personalised touch.

Yeah.

It's almost impossible for the nature of our industry to have kind of like [ORG-10], the [ORG-13] kind of engagements.

Yeah.

It just doesn't really work. However, that may change in the tool case. But there was a revenue tool that you were looking at like an analytics tool.

Yeah, there's an analytics tool called revenue intelligence. And pretty much what it does is our standard dashboards and reports are great, but they are very one-dimensional.

So when you start looking at trends and how we're doing across different times and what changes and all that kind of stuff, we do have an analytics tool built into [ORG-5] if that's a miniatures.

That's definitely one interest. Yeah, that's a huge part of [GPE-3]' is, you know, [DATE-10] have to give on a forecast report, the in-depth report test report.

Attention.

And if there's anything that could step that up, it's fantastic. I'm the sales manager, I'm sorry, the [ORG-5] admin here, but I also run the sales and marketing operations.

So it's part of that is, you know, forecasting and analytics.

Mm-hmm.

You know, finding the story and the numbers.

Yeah.

So if there's any tools that you could recommend that you guys offer out of the box that help sales ops perspective, that's gonna be the most valuable thing.

Yeah. Yeah.

You know, when you bring up that subject, are you using pipeline inspection [DATE-3]?

No, how could, I turned it on.

Pipeline inspection, it's free. OK.

I don't use this, what is pipelines?

Do you remember what is that again?

Okay. Pipeline inspection is like, you know, when you have an opportunity list view and it tells you like, okay, here are the dates, here are the ages. Pipeline inspection takes it to the next level.

It starts introducing the trends. Hey, this was $[MONEY-1]. It just moved to 28. It just moved to five. Or this was a deal that was supposed to close in [DATE-13].

Now is closing in the third or neck. Now is closing [DATE-10]. So it kind of has a little bit of like those. kind of [ORG-10] trends built into it about where things are going to. Yeah.

Gotcha. Yeah, I'm gonna take a note of that. Super valuable. I can't I feel like I've turned it on but I just haven't used it. I gotta go double check It's been crazy over

Yeah. It used to be for Unlimited edition. So basically, you've been an ecosystem long enough.

We probably have seen, we take new innovation, we release it in [ORG-10] for those customers, get their feedback, and then if it does seem like we're sounding like, people should just have this across the board.

They introduce it into Enterprise edition. That is when they will release it to pretty much all our customers. And pipeline inspection is one of them.

So pipeline inspection, I can send you information too, let me make note of that. And again, like that's something that you have available [DATE-3], like no 10% or other products needed, like you can roll that out.

But it's pretty cool in the way that we kind of handle our forecasting as well, to understand like where the risks might be or how we're trending in certain areas.

Yeah, that sounds fantastic. Yes. I think from my perspective, if we were to offset [PERCENT-6] and add a tool, anything that can help with, you know, forecasting analytics sales up stuff would be probably bring most of that.

Yeah.

So if you know, I don't want to take up too much of your time, but if you could just quit the job down a list of products and I can do all the research that you think would be relevant.

It could literally just be as simple as like a bulleted list of the name of the product and I can go out and find it and then.

Now, I'm happy to kind of walk through things. I always prefer to have like a conversation about them anyway, obviously coming from the solution agenda inside.

I love talking about our products and like the ins and outs of it.

Yeah, you were a switch that's here beforehand.

I knew have I.

I think, you know, that's what makes you the probably the most effective sales person we've had at [ORG-5].

It's not that that's a teacher horn a little bit, but you have like a deep understanding of the products, which has been extremely beneficial for us.

No, I appreciate that super.

Yeah, no, absolutely. That's why even like the live chat connector, I was like, actually, we have this and we can kind of connect things in.

And the other part of it, too, is like, I kind of know what are like the big, what are like some of the bigger implementations that you'd have to do versus like lower panging fruit across the board.

I'm going to do like, you have [ORG-8], which I think is like one of the heavier ones, but also heavier return.

Don't forget to subscribe to our channel.

Yeah, that sounds great.

So if you want to

I don't know what your timeline looks like, but I'm wide open. Either [DATE-10] morning or [TIME-4] [TIME-5] [DATE-10].

Okay.

Possibly actually maybe 3.313482107109186 just to be safe.

Yeah, how about this?

I could do [TIME-6] [DATE-10].

Does that work?

Yeah, that's perfect.

Cool.

What's that?

Let's, uh, I'll, uh, I'll have a couple of slides. I'll walk through just like some different things and you can just can be kind of like the thumbs up. Some kind of like that does pertain to our company.

The only mention of a competitor was when the customer mentioned that they are not interested in replacing Zen Desk with another customer support tool. The sales rep also did not bring up any competitors in the conversation.
Note: I have used generic terms such as ""seller"", ""customer"", ""seller's product"" and ""customer's boss"" as per the instructions. I have also avoided using pronouns in my response.","1. The customer seemed to get excited about the possibility of signing a multi-year deal and potentially waiving a percentage of the price increase. They also expressed interest in the ""premier success"" offering, which includes accelerators, coaching, and premier webinars. Additionally, they showed interest in tools that could help with forecasting, analytics, and sales operations.

2. The top three questions asked by the sales rep where the customer seemed more engaged afterwards were:

Whether there were any big changes happening soon, such as within [DATE-8].
Inquiring about other tools the customer might be using, like JIRA or QuickBooks, and their potential relevance for connecting data.
Discussing the possibility of setting up an automatic system to transfer support tickets that turn out to be sales-related to the sales team, which seemed to resonate with the customer's experience.
3. The topics most discussed around competitors were related to pricing increases imposed by the seller, potential changes in pricing for the customer's renewal, and the possibility of signing a multi-year deal to mitigate the price increase. There were also discussions about tools and offerings that the seller provides compared to what competitors might offer, such as premier success, analytics tools, and integration capabilities with other platforms like ZenDesk or JIRA. However, specific competitor names or detailed comparisons were not mentioned in the transcript.","Based on the provided transcript, here are the answers to the specified questions:

1. Customer Excitement/Impactful Product Features:

The customer expressed excitement about the Premier Success package, which includes accelerators, live coaching, premier webinars, and essentially acts as having an additional admin on their team to troubleshoot. This was highlighted when the seller mentioned, ""premier success... having an additional [ORG-5] admin on your team to troubleshoot,"" and the customer responded positively, saying, ""That may be pretty cool... called premier success.""
Another area of interest for the customer was the integration capabilities, specifically the pre-built connectors for integrating [ORG-5] with other applications like Zendesk and QuickBooks, as well as the free implementation program mentioned by the seller. The customer was keen on this, indicating an interest in further information.
2. Top 3 Engaging Questions by the Sales Rep:

When the sales rep inquired about the customer's big plans and timelines (""When you say big things happening, is that something in like [DATE-6], [DATE-7], like how off is big news happening?""), it engaged the customer in discussing their future needs and potential expansions.
The question about the customer's current use and perspective on analytics tools (""And if there's anything that could step that up, it's fantastic. I'm the sales manager, I'm sorry, the [ORG-5] admin here, but I also run the sales and marketing operations."") led to a detailed discussion on the value of forecasting and analytics for the customer.
Asking the customer about their use of other tools besides Zendesk for integration purposes (""Are you using any other tools besides ZenDesk, like I'm using JIRA or anything else that would be relevant to kind of connect data to?"") opened up a conversation on the broader tech stack and integration needs of the customer.
3. Most Discussed Topics Around Competitors:

The conversation around integrating [ORG-5] with Zendesk and QuickBooks involves indirect mention of competitors through the discussion of integration capabilities. The sales rep's offer of pre-built connectors to integrate [ORG-5] with these platforms implies a competitive edge in seamless integration.
The mention of [ORG-9]'s acquisition by [ORG-5] as a leader in integration points to a strategic move to enhance [ORG-5]'s capabilities in competing with other platforms that offer similar integration functionalities.
The sales rep's mention of specific tools and platforms like JIRA and QuickBooks during the integration discussion indirectly involves competitors by highlighting [ORG-5]'s adaptability and integration prowess with widely used business applications, which might not be as straightforward with other CRM platforms.
This analysis is based solely on the contents of the transcript provided and does not include conjecture beyond the information contained within the dialogue.",Model 1,goal,Model 1,
"You will be presented with a transcript of a sales call between a seller/sales representative and a customer. The transcript can be noisy and contain several mistakes, e.g. when both speakers are speaking simultaneously. Only the raw transcript will be provided and not the Speaker IDs, so you will have to identify the seller and the customer in the conversation in order to perform your task.
Your job is to read the transcript carefully and accurately answer a few questions regarding the prospect of the deal being discussed, e.g. customer sentiment, concrete next steps, mentions of competitors, or any blockers from closing the deal. Construct your response using only the information contained in the call transcript. If you are unable to find sufficient evidence to answer a given question, say so in the response rather than conjecturing beyond what’s evident from the call transcript.
Make sure your response is direct, concise and professional. Refrain from using redacted PIIs (e.g. [ORG-1], [PERSON-2]) in your response and use generic terms such as “seller”, “customer”, “seller’s product” and “customer’s boss” as much as possible. Only use the specific naming convention ([PERSON-1]) when there are other individuals mentioned apart from seller/customer that are worth noting.
Avoid using pronouns in your response when possible. If you have to, use they/their/them.

Questions:
1. Overall, did the customer seem to bring up a lot of our competitor features compared to ours? Were any of them deal-breakers?
2. Overall, did the customer seem to feel that our product meets their needs?
3. Did it seem like we had the right decision maker on the call to move the deal forward? If not, who is the correct person, and what were the agreed-upon next steps?


Transcript:
""And hires, but it kind of gives you an idea of something that we could do. So in this particular one, you pull up the job title, let's say for instance, with this one, it was board of control agent.

And see, that's going to

Drill out into what open jobs are there, active jobs, declined applications. And then as we go through, we can segment that out considerably. So we can, the qualifications, average days, they've been on that.

And then break it down even more. And then as he wants to bring that into a little more line with what he's looking for, all he has to do is click on that piece, and into line.

That will bring that like on this one, if you scroll down a little bit.

Yeah,

Down. No, I'm not that. Yeah, go down a

Sorry. little lower where you had the I would say the column charts towards the bottom of the of that page.

Right. These So he would be

Going down. Yeah. Yeah. he would look you know, you know, I'm going to call these outliers like that. I think it's 70 K. He wouldn't want to be able to drill down into things like that.

Does that make sense?

Sure. It does. Yeah.

The beauty of

These dashboards is the fact that we can do that. So yeah, And then we can finally get to a point where we've got the right data and we can then pop into those records.

Exactly.

Now,

So I think we can kind of mesh what we've got here with what we have over here to give you a little more of a [QUANTITY-1] view.

We do have demographics in this particular one, but I don't think it's even going to go as far down as what you were considering. So it's going to be based on demographics of the person itself.

Yeah, you would want the demographics again by series and maybe even by level kind of like what I was getting.

Um, an example.

Yeah.

Okay. Yeah, that shouldn't be too bad. We should be able to do that. No problem. Um, I just wanted to make sure that I understood what you guys were looking for and pictures 1063 words, you know, you.

So I can show I'm a visual person.

Yeah, and so let me see here. Let me just refresh this. The way this particular one was designed was all around the position itself and then being able to fill that position with applicants and things like that.

What I've done over here, if I take a look at [PERSON-1] for instance, I have in here what we call a career map based on what you had shown us. Now those are two positions.

One of them is the current career preference. The other one is a position that she would be interested in. And so what I can do then is I can go in there. Whoops, my bad. There we go.

I can go in and I can open one of these up. When I edit this, then I have the ability.

Whoops.

I hate it when I do those kind of things. Sorry about that. And you're fine. This is what I wanted to pull up.

What I can do is I can look at this and I can see from here, well, based on her competencies, And I can change these headers.

You know,

This is no problem. But what I can do is look at this and I can see, based on what we're looking at here, she's good to go.

If we're going in as a GS9, she's good to go with everything but this one. And she needs to go ahead and take that financial management class to be qualified to move into that position.

If we go into GS12, well, now she's got a few more position requirements that she's going to need to fulfill before she meets that. And that's really what that's intended to do.

Then we go into the current development activities for this employee and we can see here, well, what has she completed versus what is she in progress with?

Now, there's a couple different ways we can show that. We can go in there this way or we can go in through, I believe it was the assessments. Let me just pull one of those up.

And with the assessments, what we're going to be able to show here is we've got a summary report of all the classes that she needs to take in order to meet that particular requirement, whatever she's trying to do.

We can also come over here and I believe it's under.

There's several different places I can pull this information out, but I can look at the gap analysis and this gap analysis, of course, is blank, but is intended to show me.

Where where do we need to be and what are we missing?

Are we [DATE-1] and

So that

You fulfill that and get a little more data in there. If that's important So here, just, and I'm going to call it as a perspective.

To you.

And I, so ours is not but I like how personally I like how this is linked.

That way [DATE-1],

Are I would say career plan [DATE-1], and this you know, it's something we're used to.

Goes back to,

So not, not to say it can't be changed. It's kind of like though is.

I would say it's the individuals, I'm going to call it career plan as far as previous couple of PEOs has done is what is that dream job that you want Okay.

What the

Upon retirement?

And then so let's say that dream job is whatever, I'm just going to use my position. Okay. And then that dream job they see that and they're typically within the civilian sector, it's a [DATE-2] career.

So you're kind of looking that far out.

And so what we want individual and the supervisor to do is then backwards Through training through assignments so you know different job titles or our duty duties To build up to him or her achieve in that you know that final Career job of choice if that makes sense It does.

Plan.

Yeah.

And so ours

Is not necessarily tied to, I would say, the, some of the, I would say, what you had, you know, the [ORG-1] levels there. It's more kind of like their dream.

And then, then we build the structure of their dream as far as, okay, if you want to be a deputy at this, this level, and this is what I think we would use our tool for two in you, you need to have to, to your point.

The optimal world is,

You know, four or five of these trainings, you know, supervisor training, critical thinking, [ORG-2], to be at that point, you would have to be like a, let's say for an assignment, you would have to be either, you know, a branch chief or a division chief in, in whatever, a couple areas.

And then for that position.

To qualify

And then take those steps backwards, if someone's just entering the civilian sector, take them all the way back to where that person has started so that he or she would kind of have like kind of a road

Map, not necessarily where you can't veer off left and right, but kind of help keep them focused, does that make sense?

At least a road map to

It does, yeah, and that's what this [ORG-3] was intended to do. Yeah.

So the career

Segment, we're going from a [DATE-3] to a GS10 on this particular one. But it shows me all the career goals and objectives.

Shows me the required individual training and then as I move on into Well, the basically looking at what she's done since she Is here?

That I can see from here activity analysis

Yeah, we also have activity records and the activity activity record shows me During this what has she not is she in progress

Started yet?

What learning?

Where has she completed and where did she decide it didn't fit so?

No, this is perfect or this is awesome because how I view have an [ORG-3] and it's like our short term goals so like less than three years and then an [ORG-3] of like three [DATE-4].

This because we

So those those things in my view and I'm glad you brought this up. They actually they tie to your career plan. But those IDPs would be focused on those things that you want to accomplish

In [DATE-5]. Hopefully they're inching inch stones to your quote unquote dream job again, if that makes sense. It does. It does. Yeah.

And here, if

You look at the recommendations also, we can see here are some additional courses that she could take. These are based on analytics. We can see that And then finally, we've got the activities at the end.

This would be kind of a review meeting, you know, for instance, supervisor sat down with her and said, hey, OK, we understand where you want to go, how are we going to get there?

If the

And then they're Recording that time on record that they have spoken to one another.

So that you have it

Yeah. No, that's good. So in an optimal world, into an optimal world.

Though, and this goes

Is like the [ORG-3] piece for us. The system of record is camp slash catmas. I don't know if you've heard that or not.

And then the training pieces is also in there as far as you know, what type of training. the individual is planning over [DATE-6], [DATE-7], [DATE-8], those type of things.

So that's kind of the, I'm going to call it the system of record.

So

I think for the optimal for this, So we're not duplicating entries is again, pulling information from camp [GPE-1] to help build, I would say

Some of your graphs and that you're seeing if they're on schedule, seeing the other things that you were showing me over.

If they're behind some of

Does that make sense?

Yeah, and all of this information can be populated in from that. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's not an issue at all.

And then the other piece of it is if I go back over here to [PERSON-2], you know, right now the way we've got it set up is we're looking at a person.

And then we're going over here and we're looking at the [ORG-3]. Do you want to be able to look at a position or a job series.

Not a position?

I'm sorry, And from that job

Series, see all the employees that are under that job series.

Is that what you're asking for to?

Oh,

Sounded like Yeah, so for instance, let's say this HR specialist, you know, if I will click on this particular one, this would be the job series and then from here I could look at all of the employees right now there's only one but I can put more

In. But look at all the employees that are under that particular career path within your CEO. Yeah, so what he has mentioned to me, Mr. [PERSON-3] is.

What

So going back to let's say the career plan, and I'm giving you an example, how many people want to go to senior service college in [DATE-9]?

How many people,

Okay. So he would want a, I'm going to call it like a roll up of, and it's not by series, it's by population.

And then he would want to drill down by, you know, by series, Okay, we got 10 people that want to go to senior servers college and [DATE-9].

But he would want to know,

Okay.

Are these 10, then you know, are these 10 people?

One of the factors going into senior service colleges, a SERP rating, which is a- I say- to tell you something, Yeah, okay.

Did want to If I go over here, I meant I just want to point it out, right there's the SERP.

Yeah.

So looking back, how many, will they have enough evaluations, let alone enough EP SERPs?

To be well qualified for that position.

And

Then another one, so that's an example on training.

Another one would be, who wants to be like a deputy at my level then he could look across the board to see who's interested in those positions and then go into your previous chart where you had the, I'm gonna call it the [ORG-4] chart, Do they have the right quote unquote classes training as far as that succession plan to be competitive for my position?

Someday?

And

If that makes

Sense over. It does. Yeah. And what we're looking at here is something like what you're talking Now it's just worded differently.

About. Yeah. We need to. But that would be. Yeah.

That would be, I think, at least from a visual and from a, I'm going to call it a perspective, not that it has to be exactly this way, but you, the tool has that ability to do, I guess is my thought

Over. It can. It can. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, just to give you an example, when we look at my career maps. This was career projection.

And all I did was just change the labels reads what we needed to read.

So that it

And I could do the same here. The other piece is if I drill into any one of these particular pieces, I can go over to related.

And if I've exposed it, I can see who's taking this class or so on and so forth, So, you know, there's some relationship management, I guess you could say that we can mess with a little bit to make this a little more relevant to what you're looking

Something like that.

For. Now this is yeah, I like say I've always been impressed myself.

So yes Well in the other piece of it that I wanted to kind of review if I can remember correctly. Yeah See these positions here, let's go into one of these for a [ORG-5] Yeah, we've got approvals.

No never mind. I think I've covered everything I wanted to I just wanted to make sure that I had Everything it wasn't

Missing anything No, and to your, I think it was one of your first charts, you know, because you had the retirements and those type of things and that's, you know, something that he's interested in because I think, you know, the natural follow-on question is, have we built, you know, the right succession plan for, you know, for [PERSON-4] up in this, you know, administrative, you know, you know, that's planning to retire, whatever, what year that is, you know, that do we have the right succession plan in there to, you know, to bring someone up in there?

Or are we going to have to go out for a new, you know, let's say a whole new announcement to, you know, back fill that position Yeah, and

Over?

What you're looking at here, just to kind of go through this a little bit here too. I mean, if I'm looking at acquisition we're over this yellow.

Specialist,

That is, okay, at grade eight, I've got four. people in here. I've got four people who meet that need at a yellow.

Okay, if I go down to budget analysis, I've got one person that has that budget analysis at grade eight, but I've got five at grade nine.

So, you know, I can bring them up to speed And that's kind of what the whole goal of this me understand that, because

Very quickly.

Chart is. So help me, help I guess I, when I actually saw that, I took it as a little bit different. So that's a retirement eligible employee. So what's the top that goes from

Seven two 16?

It does, yeah. And I think a little bit.

This might be throwing you

Ok. Yeah. I mean, we can, this is a fun part about [ORG-6]. We OK. We can talk about it a little bit differently if we figure out how it would work best for you.

Can change the top track.

So with this one, I've got administration and program specials.

I've got in grade seven, I've got three people that are yellow, meaning I've got three employees who with just one effort, one class maybe, they can be and they're ready to go.

Up to three

Okay, good. I've already got two people that are fully qualified.

Gotcha. No, no, that makes more sense because I always look at because how I how I interpret retirement eligible is. using those same job categories And then we would have like FY numbers up top, like FY 19.

Or whatever like that.

And then you could still see, I would say use your chick-lit chart, but green would be whatever.

We define what green is, but like no one's retirement eligible [DATE-10], but then yellow is five people are retirement eligible [DATE-10]. And then red is up to 10.

Or whatever we define that to that would help us, you know, I would think, when I say us, I would think even in industry, but shoot, if we got 10 people eligible to retire in [DATE-10], we want to make sure that people, you know, in the queue are, you know, to your point .

Be. Because

Well trained, you know the 22 level on your top one, you know we got whatever 10 people eligible hopefully the people behind them are pretty well positioned to take that you know that those 10 slots that are retirement eligible

That whatever at

Over. Yeah, it does. And I just noticed this says job series right here. So with this one, if I choose I've got 12 rows and if I drill into that.

You'll see that gives me the current employee population at each grade for that particular going series.

Yeah, so are some No, so an equivalent to what you're showing is a grade for us would be and like whatever it's the act demo.

Of you drilling a little more.

So it would be like NH2 NH3 you know [ORG-7]. Which they all they all equate to a [ORG-1] level.

It's just it's a band of [ORG-1]'s versus just the specific [ORG-1] like this, you know, the [ORG-1] 10 or the GS 9 there to change.

Over. Okay. Yeah, and that's easy enough Yeah, no problem there at all.

Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

We can also take this a little bit further, and I'm just going to reset this so we can see it again. Yeah, most of the stuff that we've got in these dashboards are fairly configurable.

And so we can just, if we can figure out what we want to show, yeah, that's always the challenge. Once we figure that out, then the rest of it kind of falls into place.

But we also have the ability, let's see this [ORG-3], we can click on that, that will open up the record and now I can go out and see that record, that [ORG-3].

Say we come down here, we

So yeah, we're going to populate some more data in there. And I've

Got a lot of notes here. I'll take these notes and put them into play and I'll give this a whirl and see how it looks.

And then we can check back

Yeah, so and and I'm just going through and this is me talking and I'm hoping [PERSON-5] is going down the same path.

So when [PERSON-6] and I kind of spoke earlier, and I think you have it in the, I'm gonna call it the other chicklet charts where the different levels were the different grade series.

Some of

And then by the qualifications on the left-hand side.

So the three scenarios that we kind of looked at were, one, you know, succession planning, which we've kind of talked about, you know, so again, let's say this, and I'm using row one as the administrative assistant, but going back to the [PERSON-7], if we got whatever 10 people that, whatever, got some people that are retirement eligible and [DATE-12], we want to make sure that we have a good succession plan for that and people are in the queue.

You make up a number, but we

Okay. Scenario number two is a new requirement.

So

I don't know if you probably are familiar with [ORG-8].

Is that a fair assessment?

Point-like tactical vehicle. I'm not. OK, anyway. So it's a new [GPE-2] program.

And it's so to stand up that office, We are going to need certain skill sets, whether it's software engineers, whether it's mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, whether it's certain business management folks.

We would want to populate that office or move people into that office that have these type of skills, you know, and not necessarily all of them, but at least the foundation of those skills, those personnel.

So at least they have a core of you know, highly qualified individuals and then other folks join their team.

Would

So that would be kind of another scenario.

So we would want to be able to, I think, look at those job series, you know, potentially some unique training to see if, you know, they would be well positioned for that, for that.

Qualifications or

[PERSON-8] opportunity. And then, and then after that, you know, like say, after those people are identified, and then we would, you know, bring other people in there. So that would be kind of like scenario number two.

And then the third scenario is, I would say just on kind of like a day to day basis where whatever, let's, let's say we have an [ORG-9], which is an H3, [ORG-9] is an assistant program manager so they're, they are.

That level, that person is responsible for the most part for the total life cycle acquisition, the procurement fielding of a system. And you name the system, a bridging item or something like that.

Not a [ORG-8] because they're too big, but in our portfolio, it's items that are primarily caught. But anyway, so let's say that person leaves the organization. And whatever in that item, and I'll just say that dozer.

I'm going to make it up. That dozer is getting ready to go into tests. and then into a material release.

There may be other APMs to help them gain experiences and then help them to become that NH4, that program officer.

They believe they need to have that test and material release experience so that they're more qualified for a [ORG-10] position.

So we could do internal moves to put that [ORG-9] in that position, and then where they that [ORG-9] came from, then we could

Vacated, where do it like another higher action or something like that.

Does make sense?

That Hopefully it does, [PERSON-6], and then we can, he and I can find more together on that. So I'm trying to think of, I don't,

Trying to think civilian.

Of a

Yeah, I just so yeah. That's all. I was just going to go ahead and give us

A specific example of that case that you've dealt with recently to like illustrate it. I don't know. So just at whatever. Within the life cycle. I'm going to call the acquisition life cycle.

There's there's I'm going to call it multiple stages or multiple phases within the acquisition lifecycle. There's the upfront stuff, let's just call it developing an acquisition strategy, acquiring an [ORG-12], getting that contracting actions done.

Then the next stage would be contract award and going through tests. The next stage would be, you know, developing logistics support, you know, and getting that piece of equipment for ready for a material release.

And then the next stage or whatever would be, you know, actually fielding the equipment to the soldier. On a bad note, it takes the arming, I would say, the acquisition community a very long time to complete that action.

Sometimes it's, you know, it's between whatever, [DATE-10], some systems like [LAW-1] programs. It can be, you know, seven, [DATE-12] before that piece of equipment. It's delivered to the solver.

So prior to that, it's in one of those previous stages, whether it's a contracting stage, [PRODUCT-1] stage, you know, the testing phase, anywhere like that.

So there are a few times when one [ORG-9] is there for the for its entirety, you know, because they're always looking in the sense of trying to get promoted.

For other opportunities.

So, for us in order to get promoted, you have to go through a resume scrub and you have to get an interview.

And typically, those questions or those resume scrub criteria focus on some of those different areas, whether it's the contracting piece, whether it's the funding piece, whether it's the fielding piece, So in order to do well, you know, in that resume or that interview, they have to gain some experiences in those areas.

So, so a person that they may have the contracting the [ORG-12] and the testing, but they're missing, you know, the logistics, the material release piece, you know, of that, of that complete pie.

But yet they, but on their career plan, they have, you know, a program officer they want to, they want to do.

And if there's an opportunity for them to move over to another position, [ORG-9] position to gain additional experiences to make them more competitive for that program officer experience, we would highly encourage

Them to take that opportunity, if that makes sense. I think so. I think so. Yeah. Like I said, I'll go through this with [PERSON-6] offline. Well.

We'll come back with an additional questions, but I got it. I do want to just make sure we have that because that's important. Are you saying you want us to be able to tell that story

Via dashboards and [ORG-6] here?

Well, I just, so maybe a different way to, and it maybe chart here.

Goes to this chick-click

Maybe we look at it a different way that's already built. So let's say we have, so an in-h3 is like a GS12.

And then let's say the experiences or what we're looking for is on the left-hand side where you have accountability, build diverse, dah, can put acquisition type stuff in there.

[PERSON-9]. You

So you could have [ORG-12], you could have RFP. You could name it however you wanted to.

And then from this chart, you could see that if you could look at it from... entirety across the PO, you know, who is green in these areas and then who is yellow in these areas and then tie it to their career plan for who wants to move up to that GS17

Level.

Is that maybe is that a better a better way to do it?

Maybe

I think you're doing a great job explaining it. I get it. What I'm asking is that's

Something you want us to talk through and show in [ORG-6].

Yeah, I think you could do that here though, right?

I mean, I mean, you could use it, you know, instead of Whatever, you can use this for multiple approaches. So yes, I think it

Would be fruitful to discuss

Over, I guess, to your question. I'm going to show you there. Really quick. Let's just assume we're looking at this screen. On the left, we've got names of people. On the right, we've got these chocolate charts.

I like that name, by the way. But we have the different stages of the programs. Instead of [PERSON-10], GS7, [PERSON-12], we have the different stages of programs. And we can show who has experience in what stage.

And so there'll be a bunch of green, yellow, and red chicklets all over the place.

But instead of breaking it up as GS5 for [PERSON-7], we can start to show a picture of who has experience where and where their gaps are.

And then from there, you could then say, OK, [PERSON-10] has experienced in you know these first two stages but not in [DATE-17] so experience the last two stages

He obviously needs to move to get

And vice versa [PERSON-12] has experienced in [DATE-17] but not the first two You know So you're

Potentially they could switch roles. Yeah, exactly saying like for instead of GS5 it would be [PERSON-10] instead of [ORG-10] in the no, okay You'd be stage one

Instead of just having to be

Staged too. And it wouldn't actually be stage one. There's actual names that they have. And [PERSON-17] rattle them all off, but I forget them.

But it's It's very much a [PERSON-16]

Also a pup.

Document to look up the army acquisition process. If you [ORG-12] it, you can see the stages.

Yeah, I'll do that. But the names of the people would be on the left. And then the stages they have experience with would be on the right.

Is that kind of what you're thinking, [PERSON-17]?

Yeah, well, I guess I was looking at it, whatever. And I think it's from different approaches because you could, whatever, go in, but let's keep this chart up here though, please.

But you could, when we were talking earlier about the program management, that 236 series, how many, the PO would wanna look across the, I'm going to call it the Enterprise for whatever. Let's just say it's 10 people.

But then if you, and then like say, taken into this example, if have a position or a system that is getting ready for fielding, you could click on that overview, and then you would get a drill down to in the sense of.

We

One, you could look at it from two different perspectives. One, is it a critical piece of equipment that we want to put someone in there that has

Fielding experience?

Or two, does someone want that fielding experience to help them grow their career?

Does that make sense?

[PERCENT-1]. Yeah.

So you can look at it from different approaches and to help the team because if they needed someone with that specific experience they could pull or if they wanted to groom someone to help them with their career planning.

They could do that, you know, they could do that too. So options, I guess.

But to your point, I don't know that I was looking at a little different way in the sense that the left side would be the, you know, the contracting milestone, be whatever.

And then the top could be, you know, the rankings, when I say the rankings as far as the grade structure, but I'm not tied to

Either way. It just, my mind was linking what you had on the chart to

Try and to make it as simple of a conversion if that makes sense over Yeah, I think it does I just need to think about it .

Yeah, because I always look because whatever, for my perspective, trying to make it, trying to make it as easy as possible.

And I'm just

But going back to the [ORG-1] and I'm pointing to the screen like you can see me.

Going back to the [ORG-1] 12 level, you know, you, whatever, and this, let's say this [ORG-1] 12, this is, you know, whatever, it's a series of things on the left-hand side where you have, and I'm making this up, but [ORG-12] contracting, we would list all of those acquisition things that [PERSON-6] was tying to, and then this

Would be an individual record, but

Then it would be also pulled up to a higher record that would include all of the APMs, if that makes sense, over. I think so, yes. Yeah, yep.

Because then you can hopefully It would you could drill down into it. Because if let's just say you wanted to see those folks that.

Had [ORG-12] experience because you realize that it's very critical, then it would list those [ORG-9]'s. that have [ORG-12] experience and then,

Hey, we got a list of five candidates that have that, whatever or whatever over.

That need that

Okay. Now, and I'm trying to show, I I really do.

Think I'm getting what you're trying to say.

I just

Figure out how I might want to display that on the screen. Yeah. But just know that though.

I think I might Okay. And I. Yeah, I like to say it's it can be done. I just right.

Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Yeah, I'm not at all concerned

About it being done as far as that goes. It's just getting it through my thick skull.

No, well, but I think I'm getting no, I guess my my the reason for my comment is it's for me anyway, it's easily relatable. in the sense that it this way, you can show

If you can show it another way.

It's just a matter of, what is the preferences of the command?

Well, and that's exactly You're absolutely right.

It. Yes.

I this way versus in a real life scenario, it's all a matter of changing the metadata behind That is [PERCENT-1] This is designed to really just give you a picture to play with.

Mean, if I want to show it how you might do it

It. Correct. Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. true.

Yeah, no, exactly. Yes. And I like the picture. So yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And there's, we've done some similar things.

I've got to look back over a couple of my other demos have something like that with the acquisition life cycle and all that laid out.

That I've got. I may actually

But I'll, I'll just take a look and see. Okay. Because

I know we've done a little bit of work with the acquisition life cycles and the acquisition process. But I just don't remember off the top of my head.

Yeah, and I don't know, like [PRODUCT-2], I don't know if they have anything like this because they may have something similar to this in a sense, but they would not, it wouldn't be as in depth, because they do I would say a lot of the very, very early work

As far as

Development testing, that type of stuff over.

Sure, I'll follow you. Yeah, we

Got to get going here. Me and [PERSON-17] both have [TIME-1].

I do too.

So you taking the time.

I think I've got what I need for now. I really appreciate No problem. If you please don't hesitate I, sir, I can Thank you, sir.

Have further questions, to reach out. do that.

Thank you, everyone.

All right. Take care. Yes. Have a good day.
""","And hires, but it kind of gives you an idea of something that we could do. So in this particular one, you pull up the job title, let's say for instance, with this one, it was board of control agent.

And see, that's going to

Drill out into what open jobs are there, active jobs, declined applications. And then as we go through, we can segment that out considerably. So we can, the qualifications, average days, they've been on that.

And then break it down even more. And then as he wants to bring that into a little more line with what he's looking for, all he has to do is click on that piece, and into line.

That will bring that like on this one, if you scroll down a little bit.

Yeah,

Down. No, I'm not that. Yeah, go down a

Sorry. little lower where you had the I would say the column charts towards the bottom of the of that page.

Right. These So he would be

Going down. Yeah. Yeah. he would look you know, you know, I'm going to call these outliers like that. I think it's 70 K. He wouldn't want to be able to drill down into things like that.

Does that make sense?

Sure. It does. Yeah.

The beauty of

These dashboards is the fact that we can do that. So yeah, And then we can finally get to a point where we've got the right data and we can then pop into those records.

Exactly.

Now,

So I think we can kind of mesh what we've got here with what we have over here to give you a little more of a [QUANTITY-1] view.

We do have demographics in this particular one, but I don't think it's even going to go as far down as what you were considering. So it's going to be based on demographics of the person itself.

Yeah, you would want the demographics again by series and maybe even by level kind of like what I was getting.

Um, an example.

Yeah.

Okay. Yeah, that shouldn't be too bad. We should be able to do that. No problem. Um, I just wanted to make sure that I understood what you guys were looking for and pictures 1063 words, you know, you.

So I can show I'm a visual person.

Yeah, and so let me see here. Let me just refresh this. The way this particular one was designed was all around the position itself and then being able to fill that position with applicants and things like that.

What I've done over here, if I take a look at [PERSON-1] for instance, I have in here what we call a career map based on what you had shown us. Now those are two positions.

One of them is the current career preference. The other one is a position that she would be interested in. And so what I can do then is I can go in there. Whoops, my bad. There we go.

I can go in and I can open one of these up. When I edit this, then I have the ability.

Whoops.

I hate it when I do those kind of things. Sorry about that. And you're fine. This is what I wanted to pull up.

What I can do is I can look at this and I can see from here, well, based on her competencies, And I can change these headers.

You know,

This is no problem. But what I can do is look at this and I can see, based on what we're looking at here, she's good to go.

If we're going in as a GS9, she's good to go with everything but this one. And she needs to go ahead and take that financial management class to be qualified to move into that position.

If we go into GS12, well, now she's got a few more position requirements that she's going to need to fulfill before she meets that. And that's really what that's intended to do.

Then we go into the current development activities for this employee and we can see here, well, what has she completed versus what is she in progress with?

Now, there's a couple different ways we can show that. We can go in there this way or we can go in through, I believe it was the assessments. Let me just pull one of those up.

And with the assessments, what we're going to be able to show here is we've got a summary report of all the classes that she needs to take in order to meet that particular requirement, whatever she's trying to do.

We can also come over here and I believe it's under.

There's several different places I can pull this information out, but I can look at the gap analysis and this gap analysis, of course, is blank, but is intended to show me.

Where where do we need to be and what are we missing?

Are we [DATE-1] and

So that

You fulfill that and get a little more data in there. If that's important So here, just, and I'm going to call it as a perspective.

To you.

And I, so ours is not but I like how personally I like how this is linked.

That way [DATE-1],

Are I would say career plan [DATE-1], and this you know, it's something we're used to.

Goes back to,

So not, not to say it can't be changed. It's kind of like though is.

I would say it's the individuals, I'm going to call it career plan as far as previous couple of PEOs has done is what is that dream job that you want Okay.

What the

Upon retirement?

And then so let's say that dream job is whatever, I'm just going to use my position. Okay. And then that dream job they see that and they're typically within the civilian sector, it's a [DATE-2] career.

So you're kind of looking that far out.

And so what we want individual and the supervisor to do is then backwards Through training through assignments so you know different job titles or our duty duties To build up to him or her achieve in that you know that final Career job of choice if that makes sense It does.

Plan.

Yeah.

And so ours

Is not necessarily tied to, I would say, the, some of the, I would say, what you had, you know, the [ORG-1] levels there. It's more kind of like their dream.

And then, then we build the structure of their dream as far as, okay, if you want to be a deputy at this, this level, and this is what I think we would use our tool for two in you, you need to have to, to your point.

The optimal world is,

You know, four or five of these trainings, you know, supervisor training, critical thinking, [ORG-2], to be at that point, you would have to be like a, let's say for an assignment, you would have to be either, you know, a branch chief or a division chief in, in whatever, a couple areas.

And then for that position.

To qualify

And then take those steps backwards, if someone's just entering the civilian sector, take them all the way back to where that person has started so that he or she would kind of have like kind of a road

Map, not necessarily where you can't veer off left and right, but kind of help keep them focused, does that make sense?

At least a road map to

It does, yeah, and that's what this [ORG-3] was intended to do. Yeah.

So the career

Segment, we're going from a [DATE-3] to a GS10 on this particular one. But it shows me all the career goals and objectives.

Shows me the required individual training and then as I move on into Well, the basically looking at what she's done since she Is here?

That I can see from here activity analysis

Yeah, we also have activity records and the activity activity record shows me During this what has she not is she in progress

Started yet?

What learning?

Where has she completed and where did she decide it didn't fit so?

No, this is perfect or this is awesome because how I view have an [ORG-3] and it's like our short term goals so like less than three years and then an [ORG-3] of like three [DATE-4].

This because we

So those those things in my view and I'm glad you brought this up. They actually they tie to your career plan. But those IDPs would be focused on those things that you want to accomplish

In [DATE-5]. Hopefully they're inching inch stones to your quote unquote dream job again, if that makes sense. It does. It does. Yeah.

And here, if

You look at the recommendations also, we can see here are some additional courses that she could take. These are based on analytics. We can see that And then finally, we've got the activities at the end.

This would be kind of a review meeting, you know, for instance, supervisor sat down with her and said, hey, OK, we understand where you want to go, how are we going to get there?

If the

And then they're Recording that time on record that they have spoken to one another.

So that you have it

Yeah. No, that's good. So in an optimal world, into an optimal world.

Though, and this goes

Is like the [ORG-3] piece for us. The system of record is camp slash catmas. I don't know if you've heard that or not.

And then the training pieces is also in there as far as you know, what type of training. the individual is planning over [DATE-6], [DATE-7], [DATE-8], those type of things.

So that's kind of the, I'm going to call it the system of record.

So

I think for the optimal for this, So we're not duplicating entries is again, pulling information from camp [GPE-1] to help build, I would say

Some of your graphs and that you're seeing if they're on schedule, seeing the other things that you were showing me over.

If they're behind some of

Does that make sense?

Yeah, and all of this information can be populated in from that. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's not an issue at all.

And then the other piece of it is if I go back over here to [PERSON-2], you know, right now the way we've got it set up is we're looking at a person.

And then we're going over here and we're looking at the [ORG-3]. Do you want to be able to look at a position or a job series.

Not a position?

I'm sorry, And from that job

Series, see all the employees that are under that job series.

Is that what you're asking for to?

Oh,

Sounded like Yeah, so for instance, let's say this HR specialist, you know, if I will click on this particular one, this would be the job series and then from here I could look at all of the employees right now there's only one but I can put more

In. But look at all the employees that are under that particular career path within your CEO. Yeah, so what he has mentioned to me, Mr. [PERSON-3] is.

What

So going back to let's say the career plan, and I'm giving you an example, how many people want to go to senior service college in [DATE-9]?

How many people,

Okay. So he would want a, I'm going to call it like a roll up of, and it's not by series, it's by population.

And then he would want to drill down by, you know, by series, Okay, we got 10 people that want to go to senior servers college and [DATE-9].

But he would want to know,

Okay.

Are these 10, then you know, are these 10 people?

One of the factors going into senior service colleges, a SERP rating, which is a- I say- to tell you something, Yeah, okay.

Did want to If I go over here, I meant I just want to point it out, right there's the SERP.

Yeah.

So looking back, how many, will they have enough evaluations, let alone enough EP SERPs?

To be well qualified for that position.

And

Then another one, so that's an example on training.

Another one would be, who wants to be like a deputy at my level then he could look across the board to see who's interested in those positions and then go into your previous chart where you had the, I'm gonna call it the [ORG-4] chart, Do they have the right quote unquote classes training as far as that succession plan to be competitive for my position?

Someday?

And

If that makes

Sense over. It does. Yeah. And what we're looking at here is something like what you're talking Now it's just worded differently.

About. Yeah. We need to. But that would be. Yeah.

That would be, I think, at least from a visual and from a, I'm going to call it a perspective, not that it has to be exactly this way, but you, the tool has that ability to do, I guess is my thought

Over. It can. It can. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, just to give you an example, when we look at my career maps. This was career projection.

And all I did was just change the labels reads what we needed to read.

So that it

And I could do the same here. The other piece is if I drill into any one of these particular pieces, I can go over to related.

And if I've exposed it, I can see who's taking this class or so on and so forth, So, you know, there's some relationship management, I guess you could say that we can mess with a little bit to make this a little more relevant to what you're looking

Something like that.

For. Now this is yeah, I like say I've always been impressed myself.

So yes Well in the other piece of it that I wanted to kind of review if I can remember correctly. Yeah See these positions here, let's go into one of these for a [ORG-5] Yeah, we've got approvals.

No never mind. I think I've covered everything I wanted to I just wanted to make sure that I had Everything it wasn't

Missing anything No, and to your, I think it was one of your first charts, you know, because you had the retirements and those type of things and that's, you know, something that he's interested in because I think, you know, the natural follow-on question is, have we built, you know, the right succession plan for, you know, for [PERSON-4] up in this, you know, administrative, you know, you know, that's planning to retire, whatever, what year that is, you know, that do we have the right succession plan in there to, you know, to bring someone up in there?

Or are we going to have to go out for a new, you know, let's say a whole new announcement to, you know, back fill that position Yeah, and

Over?

What you're looking at here, just to kind of go through this a little bit here too. I mean, if I'm looking at acquisition we're over this yellow.

Specialist,

That is, okay, at grade eight, I've got four. people in here. I've got four people who meet that need at a yellow.

Okay, if I go down to budget analysis, I've got one person that has that budget analysis at grade eight, but I've got five at grade nine.

So, you know, I can bring them up to speed And that's kind of what the whole goal of this me understand that, because

Very quickly.

Chart is. So help me, help I guess I, when I actually saw that, I took it as a little bit different. So that's a retirement eligible employee. So what's the top that goes from

Seven two 16?

It does, yeah. And I think a little bit.

This might be throwing you

Ok. Yeah. I mean, we can, this is a fun part about [ORG-6]. We OK. We can talk about it a little bit differently if we figure out how it would work best for you.

Can change the top track.

So with this one, I've got administration and program specials.

I've got in grade seven, I've got three people that are yellow, meaning I've got three employees who with just one effort, one class maybe, they can be and they're ready to go.

Up to three

Okay, good. I've already got two people that are fully qualified.

Gotcha. No, no, that makes more sense because I always look at because how I how I interpret retirement eligible is. using those same job categories And then we would have like FY numbers up top, like FY 19.

Or whatever like that.

And then you could still see, I would say use your chick-lit chart, but green would be whatever.

We define what green is, but like no one's retirement eligible [DATE-10], but then yellow is five people are retirement eligible [DATE-10]. And then red is up to 10.

Or whatever we define that to that would help us, you know, I would think, when I say us, I would think even in industry, but shoot, if we got 10 people eligible to retire in [DATE-10], we want to make sure that people, you know, in the queue are, you know, to your point .

Be. Because

Well trained, you know the 22 level on your top one, you know we got whatever 10 people eligible hopefully the people behind them are pretty well positioned to take that you know that those 10 slots that are retirement eligible

That whatever at

Over. Yeah, it does. And I just noticed this says job series right here. So with this one, if I choose I've got 12 rows and if I drill into that.

You'll see that gives me the current employee population at each grade for that particular going series.

Yeah, so are some No, so an equivalent to what you're showing is a grade for us would be and like whatever it's the act demo.

Of you drilling a little more.

So it would be like NH2 NH3 you know [ORG-7]. Which they all they all equate to a [ORG-1] level.

It's just it's a band of [ORG-1]'s versus just the specific [ORG-1] like this, you know, the [ORG-1] 10 or the GS 9 there to change.

Over. Okay. Yeah, and that's easy enough Yeah, no problem there at all.

Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

We can also take this a little bit further, and I'm just going to reset this so we can see it again. Yeah, most of the stuff that we've got in these dashboards are fairly configurable.

And so we can just, if we can figure out what we want to show, yeah, that's always the challenge. Once we figure that out, then the rest of it kind of falls into place.

But we also have the ability, let's see this [ORG-3], we can click on that, that will open up the record and now I can go out and see that record, that [ORG-3].

Say we come down here, we

So yeah, we're going to populate some more data in there. And I've

Got a lot of notes here. I'll take these notes and put them into play and I'll give this a whirl and see how it looks.

And then we can check back

Yeah, so and and I'm just going through and this is me talking and I'm hoping [PERSON-5] is going down the same path.

So when [PERSON-6] and I kind of spoke earlier, and I think you have it in the, I'm gonna call it the other chicklet charts where the different levels were the different grade series.

Some of

And then by the qualifications on the left-hand side.

So the three scenarios that we kind of looked at were, one, you know, succession planning, which we've kind of talked about, you know, so again, let's say this, and I'm using row one as the administrative assistant, but going back to the [PERSON-7], if we got whatever 10 people that, whatever, got some people that are retirement eligible and [DATE-12], we want to make sure that we have a good succession plan for that and people are in the queue.

You make up a number, but we

Okay. Scenario number two is a new requirement.

So

I don't know if you probably are familiar with [ORG-8].

Is that a fair assessment?

Point-like tactical vehicle. I'm not. OK, anyway. So it's a new [GPE-2] program.

And it's so to stand up that office, We are going to need certain skill sets, whether it's software engineers, whether it's mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, whether it's certain business management folks.

We would want to populate that office or move people into that office that have these type of skills, you know, and not necessarily all of them, but at least the foundation of those skills, those personnel.

So at least they have a core of you know, highly qualified individuals and then other folks join their team.

Would

So that would be kind of another scenario.

So we would want to be able to, I think, look at those job series, you know, potentially some unique training to see if, you know, they would be well positioned for that, for that.

Qualifications or

[PERSON-8] opportunity. And then, and then after that, you know, like say, after those people are identified, and then we would, you know, bring other people in there. So that would be kind of like scenario number two.

And then the third scenario is, I would say just on kind of like a day to day basis where whatever, let's, let's say we have an [ORG-9], which is an H3, [ORG-9] is an assistant program manager so they're, they are.

That level, that person is responsible for the most part for the total life cycle acquisition, the procurement fielding of a system. And you name the system, a bridging item or something like that.

Not a [ORG-8] because they're too big, but in our portfolio, it's items that are primarily caught. But anyway, so let's say that person leaves the organization. And whatever in that item, and I'll just say that dozer.

I'm going to make it up. That dozer is getting ready to go into tests. and then into a material release.

There may be other APMs to help them gain experiences and then help them to become that NH4, that program officer.

They believe they need to have that test and material release experience so that they're more qualified for a [ORG-10] position.

So we could do internal moves to put that [ORG-9] in that position, and then where they that [ORG-9] came from, then we could

Vacated, where do it like another higher action or something like that.

Does make sense?

That Hopefully it does, [PERSON-6], and then we can, he and I can find more together on that. So I'm trying to think of, I don't,

Trying to think civilian.

Of a

Yeah, I just so yeah. That's all. I was just going to go ahead and give us

A specific example of that case that you've dealt with recently to like illustrate it. I don't know. So just at whatever. Within the life cycle. I'm going to call the acquisition life cycle.

There's there's I'm going to call it multiple stages or multiple phases within the acquisition lifecycle. There's the upfront stuff, let's just call it developing an acquisition strategy, acquiring an [ORG-12], getting that contracting actions done.

Then the next stage would be contract award and going through tests. The next stage would be, you know, developing logistics support, you know, and getting that piece of equipment for ready for a material release.

And then the next stage or whatever would be, you know, actually fielding the equipment to the soldier. On a bad note, it takes the arming, I would say, the acquisition community a very long time to complete that action.

Sometimes it's, you know, it's between whatever, [DATE-10], some systems like [LAW-1] programs. It can be, you know, seven, [DATE-12] before that piece of equipment. It's delivered to the solver.

So prior to that, it's in one of those previous stages, whether it's a contracting stage, [PRODUCT-1] stage, you know, the testing phase, anywhere like that.

So there are a few times when one [ORG-9] is there for the for its entirety, you know, because they're always looking in the sense of trying to get promoted.

For other opportunities.

So, for us in order to get promoted, you have to go through a resume scrub and you have to get an interview.

And typically, those questions or those resume scrub criteria focus on some of those different areas, whether it's the contracting piece, whether it's the funding piece, whether it's the fielding piece, So in order to do well, you know, in that resume or that interview, they have to gain some experiences in those areas.

So, so a person that they may have the contracting the [ORG-12] and the testing, but they're missing, you know, the logistics, the material release piece, you know, of that, of that complete pie.

But yet they, but on their career plan, they have, you know, a program officer they want to, they want to do.

And if there's an opportunity for them to move over to another position, [ORG-9] position to gain additional experiences to make them more competitive for that program officer experience, we would highly encourage

Them to take that opportunity, if that makes sense. I think so. I think so. Yeah. Like I said, I'll go through this with [PERSON-6] offline. Well.

We'll come back with an additional questions, but I got it. I do want to just make sure we have that because that's important. Are you saying you want us to be able to tell that story

Via dashboards and [ORG-6] here?

Well, I just, so maybe a different way to, and it maybe chart here.

Goes to this chick-click

Maybe we look at it a different way that's already built. So let's say we have, so an in-h3 is like a GS12.

And then let's say the experiences or what we're looking for is on the left-hand side where you have accountability, build diverse, dah, can put acquisition type stuff in there.

[PERSON-9]. You

So you could have [ORG-12], you could have RFP. You could name it however you wanted to.

And then from this chart, you could see that if you could look at it from... entirety across the PO, you know, who is green in these areas and then who is yellow in these areas and then tie it to their career plan for who wants to move up to that GS17

Level.

Is that maybe is that a better a better way to do it?

Maybe

I think you're doing a great job explaining it. I get it. What I'm asking is that's

Something you want us to talk through and show in [ORG-6].

Yeah, I think you could do that here though, right?

I mean, I mean, you could use it, you know, instead of Whatever, you can use this for multiple approaches. So yes, I think it

Would be fruitful to discuss

Over, I guess, to your question. I'm going to show you there. Really quick. Let's just assume we're looking at this screen. On the left, we've got names of people. On the right, we've got these chocolate charts.

I like that name, by the way. But we have the different stages of the programs. Instead of [PERSON-10], GS7, [PERSON-12], we have the different stages of programs. And we can show who has experience in what stage.

And so there'll be a bunch of green, yellow, and red chicklets all over the place.

But instead of breaking it up as GS5 for [PERSON-7], we can start to show a picture of who has experience where and where their gaps are.

And then from there, you could then say, OK, [PERSON-10] has experienced in you know these first two stages but not in [DATE-17] so experience the last two stages

He obviously needs to move to get

And vice versa [PERSON-12] has experienced in [DATE-17] but not the first two You know So you're

Potentially they could switch roles. Yeah, exactly saying like for instead of GS5 it would be [PERSON-10] instead of [ORG-10] in the no, okay You'd be stage one

Instead of just having to be

Staged too. And it wouldn't actually be stage one. There's actual names that they have. And [PERSON-17] rattle them all off, but I forget them.

But it's It's very much a [PERSON-16]

Also a pup.

Document to look up the army acquisition process. If you [ORG-12] it, you can see the stages.

Yeah, I'll do that. But the names of the people would be on the left. And then the stages they have experience with would be on the right.

Is that kind of what you're thinking, [PERSON-17]?

Yeah, well, I guess I was looking at it, whatever. And I think it's from different approaches because you could, whatever, go in, but let's keep this chart up here though, please.

But you could, when we were talking earlier about the program management, that 236 series, how many, the PO would wanna look across the, I'm going to call it the Enterprise for whatever. Let's just say it's 10 people.

But then if you, and then like say, taken into this example, if have a position or a system that is getting ready for fielding, you could click on that overview, and then you would get a drill down to in the sense of.

We

One, you could look at it from two different perspectives. One, is it a critical piece of equipment that we want to put someone in there that has

Fielding experience?

Or two, does someone want that fielding experience to help them grow their career?

Does that make sense?

[PERCENT-1]. Yeah.

So you can look at it from different approaches and to help the team because if they needed someone with that specific experience they could pull or if they wanted to groom someone to help them with their career planning.

They could do that, you know, they could do that too. So options, I guess.

But to your point, I don't know that I was looking at a little different way in the sense that the left side would be the, you know, the contracting milestone, be whatever.

And then the top could be, you know, the rankings, when I say the rankings as far as the grade structure, but I'm not tied to

Either way. It just, my mind was linking what you had on the chart to

Try and to make it as simple of a conversion if that makes sense over Yeah, I think it does I just need to think about it .

Yeah, because I always look because whatever, for my perspective, trying to make it, trying to make it as easy as possible.

And I'm just

But going back to the [ORG-1] and I'm pointing to the screen like you can see me.

Going back to the [ORG-1] 12 level, you know, you, whatever, and this, let's say this [ORG-1] 12, this is, you know, whatever, it's a series of things on the left-hand side where you have, and I'm making this up, but [ORG-12] contracting, we would list all of those acquisition things that [PERSON-6] was tying to, and then this

Would be an individual record, but

Then it would be also pulled up to a higher record that would include all of the APMs, if that makes sense, over. I think so, yes. Yeah, yep.

Because then you can hopefully It would you could drill down into it. Because if let's just say you wanted to see those folks that.

Had [ORG-12] experience because you realize that it's very critical, then it would list those [ORG-9]'s. that have [ORG-12] experience and then,

Hey, we got a list of five candidates that have that, whatever or whatever over.

That need that

Okay. Now, and I'm trying to show, I I really do.

Think I'm getting what you're trying to say.

I just

Figure out how I might want to display that on the screen. Yeah. But just know that though.

I think I might Okay. And I. Yeah, I like to say it's it can be done. I just right.

Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Yeah, I'm not at all concerned

About it being done as far as that goes. It's just getting it through my thick skull.

No, well, but I think I'm getting no, I guess my my the reason for my comment is it's for me anyway, it's easily relatable. in the sense that it this way, you can show

If you can show it another way.

It's just a matter of, what is the preferences of the command?

Well, and that's exactly You're absolutely right.

It. Yes.

I this way versus in a real life scenario, it's all a matter of changing the metadata behind That is [PERCENT-1] This is designed to really just give you a picture to play with.

Mean, if I want to show it how you might do it

It. Correct. Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. true.

Yeah, no, exactly. Yes. And I like the picture. So yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And there's, we've done some similar things.

I've got to look back over a couple of my other demos have something like that with the acquisition life cycle and all that laid out.

That I've got. I may actually

But I'll, I'll just take a look and see. Okay. Because

I know we've done a little bit of work with the acquisition life cycles and the acquisition process. But I just don't remember off the top of my head.

Yeah, and I don't know, like [PRODUCT-2], I don't know if they have anything like this because they may have something similar to this in a sense, but they would not, it wouldn't be as in depth, because they do I would say a lot of the very, very early work

As far as

Development testing, that type of stuff over.

Sure, I'll follow you. Yeah, we

Got to get going here. Me and [PERSON-17] both have [TIME-1].

I do too.

So you taking the time.

I think I've got what I need for now. I really appreciate No problem. If you please don't hesitate I, sir, I can Thank you, sir.

Have further questions, to reach out. do that.

Thank you, everyone.

All right. Take care. Yes. Have a good day.

"You will be presented with a transcript of a sales call between a seller/sales representative and a customer. The transcript can be noisy and contain several mistakes, e.g. when both speakers are speaking simultaneously. Only the raw transcript will be provided and not the Speaker IDs, so you will have to identify the seller and the customer in the conversation in order to perform your task.
Your job is to read the transcript carefully and accurately answer a few questions regarding the prospect of the deal being discussed, e.g. customer sentiment, concrete next steps, mentions of competitors, or any blockers from closing the deal. Construct your response using only the information contained in the call transcript. If you are unable to find sufficient evidence to answer a given question, say so in the response rather than conjecturing beyond what’s evident from the call transcript.
Make sure your response is direct, concise and professional. Refrain from using redacted PIIs (e.g. [ORG-1], [PERSON-2]) in your response and use generic terms such as “seller”, “customer”, “seller’s product” and “customer’s boss” as much as possible. Only use the specific naming convention ([PERSON-1]) when there are other individuals mentioned apart from seller/customer that are worth noting.

Transcript:
""All right. So yeah, really the premise of the Call is we focus on Sales quoting and then that Financial integration piece kind of those, we broke those out into three different phases for you, [PERSON-1]. Uh Because, you know, based on the conversations, that's really what the meat is and what we're looking at here, at least what the immediate need is for you.

Um and you know, really the big idea and something we wanted to drive home is Sales. We wanna create a single source of truth for Your Sales people and eventually Your entire organization. But initially, with Your use case, just the Sales people and we want to improve efficiency By doing so Increased Revenue, increase margins and then also be able to identify and capture ongoing trends to be able to report and analyze and iterate and improve.

Uh So that's kind of the overall picture of what we're trying to do here

and just to walk you through. So

I know we, we've been talking about this and it looks a lot like [PERSON-2] probably. And I know that this is you want something sexier, you want something like fender

vendors actually built on [ORG-1]. So we, I mean, we can create that exact thing. They're a huge customer of [ORG-1]. Um But this is kind of the out of the box like this is what you get the graphs, the tabular approach the you get, you know, we can have the [DATE-1]'s tasks, [DATE-1]'s events, key different deals and you can make this and configure it and customize it to Your liking.

Um But what I really wanted to drive home here is like, this is the, I think about it. I've been thinking about analogies from a guitar perspective because that's what's just been in my head. It's like this is if you Go to [ORG-2] and I'm a beginner guitar player and I wanna just pick up guitar and play it, you know, maybe every week or so.

Uh this is where I would Go to [ORG-2] and this, you get the out of the box solution. This is like the hubspot's the pipe drives of the world where you can't really customize it. You can't really configure it is what you get.

Uh and [ORG-1] is like going to fender where you can, you know, you get much more bang for Your buck. It's gonna be, yes, probably more expensive. But you're gonna have reliability, you're gonna have customer care, you're going to have Actually a good Product that you're gonna use [DATE-2]. And that's from someone that's gonna use [DATE-3]. And that's what we want to drive adoption at euphoria. We don't want someone to log into [DATE-4] and say,

what's going on in my accounts, we want someone to be able to log in and this is the first thing they see and this is what they're using every day. And so we kind of come up with a rendering. Uh We took Your website actually the little, I think that's a cat or a fox. Um,

just to show you and we can make this as pretty as we want it. This is something I put together, but we can create this as Your home page. So this is something that the Sales rep walk in and we can make it as, maybe some people say cliche a where Your report cards or Your reports, you know, because I'm thinking about teachers, how teachers will respond to the software, you know, s could be Open cases within [ORG-3] that we can push into [ORG-1]. So they can see Open deer.

The tensions would be the huge red flags. Oh my God, this is a red account. This is, they're Not gonna renew. We need to address this right away and these would all be buttons, you know, you can create a New account right from here. It would pop up. Hey, enter the account, name, whatever details you wanna enter, New opportunities, New quotes, New contracts, all of this can be something that, you know, make it as colorful and have as many graphics as you want on there. And

just wanted to get Your thoughts on this if this is something that you were expecting to see and this is what you're, you know, you know, when you see a type of interface for you. I mean,

that's Not exactly what I'm talking about. If we Go back to that first page, it's fine. Like I'm literally just saying softer edges

that looks like that's industrial to me compared to like a [PRODUCT-1] or a pipe drive, right? It's just looks like a more modern application those other two do. Whereas this to me is a little antiquated. It's Not that big a deal as long as we can get the Work done. That's just like, hey, yeah, if you put some lipstick on, it would be nice. I'd then I'd rather take you out to dinner, you know. Um

Yeah, putting lipstick on a pig.

Yeah.

Ok.

Yeah, we can, I mean Yeah, like if it's Not a big deal, you know, I don't wanna harp on it but this is something we can absolutely do. And I got emojis and what, whatever you want we can do, we can make that. Yeah. It's

just like, as long as it's, this page is responsive and move cards around the chart is dynamic, meaning I, and there's. It'll Work, you know, it doesn't have to load or drive into another page before I can see information. That's kind of my expectation and just have it feel fluid, Not systemic, like updating and then just pop up like give me a motion graphic so that it looks smooth when the charts populating or whatever. That's again, Not that important

<inaudible>

just to be able to Work in it.

So, yeah, and that's something that, you know, if

we were to move forward, that

my team would do a lot more Photoshop renderings and get Your entire Sales process and flow and build that out with you. So that's Not a problem.

Um

So moving on to the meat of it really, this is the first phase how we broke it out, which is Your basic Sales Cloud, which is Your CRM. Um and what this is gonna do is import all of Your data over. It's gonna configure Your accounts, which would they be school districts By counties or however that

may be different

leads, opportunities, contacts all of that. We would do the custom branding like you're mentioning there with creating software edges, creating logos and all of that email integration into [ORG-4] or Outlook, whatever you guys use as well as calendar integration,

data cleansing is something that was really important for you. And we wanna be able to put a process in place to be able to track different teachers moving to different schools. And so that's something that we will include there too. And then just Your basic quality assurance, making sure everything works and then training for Your team as well we include and that's gonna be [MONEY-1] to do that Implementation.

OK?

And this is this is phase one. So this is let's get on the [ORG-1] platform. Let's make sure all the data is there. Let's make sure it matches that euphoria process. Let's make sure the colors are there and we can build out the basic approvals and flows from there as well. The second piece is and before I do you have any other questions on this, I'll send this to you in a follow

up but no, Not right Now.

OK?

And then here is phase two, which is Your basic Sales Cloud one prior adding on that pri the Pricing and quoting feature. So creating that Price book of Your products portfolio, creating the opportunities automatically upon a renewal or a signature of a quote, anything like that, generating a PDF document for quotes and then also routing that to e signature platform like a docusign or a

or whatever you may use [DATE-1]. Uh approval routing. So hey, if the discount percentage is X, then [PERSON-1] needs to get eyes on it and click approve before it [ORG-5] out all of that jazz as well as all the different rations of custom fields, basically the entire quoting process within

euphoria and that's gonna be [MONEY-2]. These aren't separate. So

I phase

one, phase two includes phase one and phase two. So these are just different options for you if you just wanted to do one or if you wanted to do two or

three.

Mm

and then the last one, which is the one we recommend, which is the complete integration. This is the, you know, the full enchilada, this is doing the entire [PRODUCT-2], doing the entire Price books. But then also Now we're looking at the integration into [PERSON-2]. So we're looking at bidirectional sync between [PERSON-2] and [ORG-1] to populate accounts, invoices, financials contacts

orders and then also historical data migration. We want you to be able to every past invoice you have as well. We wanna push that into [ORG-1] too. So you have a record of it being again that [ORG-1] is gonna be Your single source of truth. And this the total package really what? So all three of them together if you wanna do it is $[MONEY-3] from our side.

And that

includes training for from Your team, whether that be [TIME-1] webinars or luncheons or in person training sessions, all of that stuff is included. And

the way that we Price things out as a consulting firm ourselves is we do a cost Not to exceed. So this estimate is a cost Not to exceed $[MONEY-3]. Everything that we promise you and everything that you want, we are going to do, even if it costs us more time, we will eat [TIME-2] and we will Not let it Go above $[MONEY-3]. So that's Your maximum investment from the Implementation

side,

ok?

And then wanted to just show you and I'll send you this. So you have it. But you were curious about maybe this was Your Financial person as well as how it is gonna Work. Uh This is kind of an architectural diagram of the integration between [ORG-1] and [ORG-6] and kind of what a pis within the engine to be able to do that is gonna be [NORP-1]. And so it'll kind of show you the process of here's Your Price book and [PERSON-2], it's gonna push into [ORG-1].

Account created and Updated. If you create an account in [ORG-6] or [ORG-1], it'll always be refreshed

opportunities. Close one. So a rep goes in, they have an Opportunity within [ORG-1]. They click close one, they send a contract, it'll push instantly to [ORG-1] or to [ORG-6] in the background and create that invoice and create that order to remit payments from Your finance team. And then on the back end, once the payment is completed, you'll be able to have a complete view of that within [ORG-1].

OK?

Just to give you a visualization on how

it would Work. Yeah.

Um and then just the last piece here, biggest piece timeline. I know Your Go to market was really [DATE-5] is what you really wanted to target. And so I put here a Start Date is [DATE-6]. We can push this down a little bit depending on approvals on Your side of the house. But if we Start in [DATE-7], we can have everything done and be training Your team on it By [DATE-8] and have them fully functional. Yeah.

Oh, that's it from my side. Uh I know that was a lot and I'll send you this. But any initial thoughts, questions,

I mean, it's just a quoting thing with Price books is what I like. Can't, you gotta understand that's important to us and ease of use. There is a, is a thing. Um and remember I'm Not on the Financial side, I understand my team creates records that end up impacting those guys, but we, I'm Not a counter. Um and that's where I'm kinda hung up is

because for me, Price books, that's a netsuite thing. We're moving away from [ORG-6] and I literally just need records to Go back to Netsuite. Like,

what's I just don't understand it. Like, could I, how [PERSON-3] into [ORG-1]? Could we Live autonomously without having to reference [PERSON-2]? Like because I'd rather build it in [ORG-1] and have like the invoice record or whatever, push out with items rather than referencing rather than it being the other way. Like [ORG-6] doesn't need to be my reference. I need [ORG-1] to be my reference and have [PERSON-2] and the information and then like following Your Price books or however that's set up

that just trickles down the next, Not vice versa. Um Does that, does that make sense?

Yeah, [PERSON-4], did you wanna touch on that one? Is that it

I mean it depends on how you wanna build it out, right? I think [PERSON-5] will or [PERSON-6], sorry [PERSON-6] will talk about this. If if you'd like to, you can build it however you want [ORG-1] can be the kind of starter of or the where the data lives that we can be the where the data lives and you can have them reference each other. You don't have to keep it up to Date if you don't like. It's just it's just preference, right? It this is the architecture they built out that you can get

to tweak and update to how you actually want the data to Live.

Yeah.

Yeah. And going along with that. So [PERSON-7] is was an acquisition By [ORG-1]. [NORP-1] is an agnostic Product saying that [NORP-1] is

it can tie into [PERSON-2] or it can tie into [ORG-1]. And so that's what [PERSON-4] was saying that the data can Live wherever you want it to be. But with [ORG-1], Your Sales people being in there, we want [ORG-1] to be that single source of truth to eventually be able to say

hey, let's give our accounting team access to [ORG-1] to where they can just send quotes out inside [ORG-1] and then [ORG-6], like maybe the CFO has a license so he can just Go in and be able to have access to it and we don't even have to log in to [ORG-6] if we don't

want to. Exactly. That's, that's the thing. Right is like, if, so we're moving away from [ORG-6]. I want everything stored in [ORG-1] and if we say peace out [ORG-6], we're Not doing financials over there, we're going to Quick Books, ok? We'll just set up the integration with Quick books. Now you, know what I mean and then all the Financial report, whatever happens By Quick Books or some other Financial tool, that's,

that's the goal, that's what I wanna make sure is [ORG-1] can stand up and quote and do all that stuff independently without that Financial system for certain components.

So we,

yeah, it will and what soft will do on the back end is make sure that wherever that data needs to be sent for financials or for kind of processing that it gets sent there, but it can Live in [ORG-1] when something Changes gets pushed to [ORG-6] or pushed to Quick Books or pushed to whatever you make Your Financial system a record in the future and have that flexibility without having to rip and replace a bunch of integrations.

<inaudible>

Yeah, and just be just be transparent with us like you're saying this is a piece you're a little bit hesitant on. Well, is it just us saying yes, we can do this or is it gonna take more than that? Just make you feel really comfortable? Like let us know so we can put you in a position where you feel like OK, this is the absolute solution

to solve this problem,

you know? No,

I, I don't remember the other guy's name and showed me, hey, yeah, here. So you add an item and it's click, add item and type in the dates. That's what I'm looking to do. And as long as I can, a certain Product Price here, great. I need it to be that easy. Um

I mean, I do have questions about reports but they're like, it's nothing crazy. Like I'm looking for a like turn By item. Tell me what people dropped [DATE-9] of what they didn't renew By item. Not By, yes, I wanna drill into the customer but as a whole who didn't renew this software line it and what's the value like that? That's what I would like to see. I'm confident we can get those reports in the system. So Not that worried about it. Um

<inaudible>

yeah, I mean, the think about it like I just, we just did this for a client [DATE-10] who wanted interactive dashboards on a home page. And so we created almost, I think the example I use was [ORG-7]. You know, if you're on Zillow dot com, looking for a home, you can filter By how many bedrooms By single family By square feet. Like we can do that inside Sales force from an accounting and reporting perspective. That's all very easily

done. Ok. Cool. That's what I'm figuring if I can do it in netsuite. And I know I can, it's just a, that I can probably figure it out in Sales too. Uh, I just don't know how it displays and the logic to get there yet, but that's ok. Ok. Cool.

Yeah. And then just something to note too. I know you wanted to be, have something that's,

you guys can manage Your Own and Riley if you specifically are the one that's gonna be managing it. And so you can be as involved or is Not involved in our Implementation process as you like. So you can, you can get an understanding if you wanna Go at the end and say, OK, I just wanna know how everything works and if I need to change some things around, I can do that, you guys can be involved in that

or if you want to be on every single one of our calls, we do [DATE-12] stand ups through teams where you can Go in and it, it's a whole process, you can be involved or is Not involved as you

want, got you and then configuration in that stuff. Like Not that worried about as long as that's what I need to make sure it's done the right

way.

Um What I, what [PERSON-8] and I need to know is if like if we need to change Your process, we want it to be a native process. Like continue to Work well just within the Ecosystem

but be able to maybe make a small tweet. Um and when we make that tweak, we don't want to have to Go then create [LOC-1] that doesn't Work on reports or can only be filtered and seen from this specific view. Like when we build something we want it to be.

Universal pervasive throughout the system accessible on all the reports, all the views, etcetera and Not have to create a [LOC-2] that references another [LOC-2]. And then this see it on a report like one out of the box functionality to Work and be able to tweak it just to

I mean

that's you're describing [ORG-1], I think,

right?

So,

OK, cool. Um What else we got here?

Let me OK, I think you're on mute. I'm sorry about

that. I said I'll Go ahead and share my screen Now. Um and there is a bit of a some range to this Pricing too. Um which [PERSON-4] may be able to speak to you a little about soft side, but give me [TIME-3].

Got you. Yeah,

I don't find that.

So this is an annual Price and I threw out two options just in case you did wanna Bring on eight users from like the training aspect. I threw that in there too because it wasn't a High fee. So

there's a, there's a few things to consider here and first off, if we're looking at [PRODUCT-3] licenses, that's the list [PERSON-9]. This is the discount [DATE-12] total. [NORP-1] range somewhere on the, this is ballpark 33 to 32

an [DATE-12] fee here. Um a couple things to think of. Uh so on the soft side, like if this doesn't fit within budget, there's certain things that we can change and adjust to get to a lower Price point or things out. Like on the side, if we were to reduce the amount of flows that can lower the Price on the [ORG-1] side, if we were to reduce the amount of licenses that could change the Price. I know you also mentioned

where you were using that was about a $[MONEY-4] fee. We could look at evaluating Quickbooks online to potentially Bring another Price, Not said that will or won't. Um That's just another option too. One other alternative

is sometimes and part of this falls back to

one thing like so right Now, we feel like we're at a good spot where in the evaluation where it makes sense to Start sharing Pricing with you, we've gotten far enough down the tunnel to Start sharing Pricing. Um But when I Go to leadership for things like discounting, they asked me like, OK, how does this still get done? Um and like

who signs and things like that. So I know you're the one running point on this and do all the due diligence. I don't know if you Bring that to [PERSON-10] and she signs off or if you have to Bring that to someone like a CFO, but those are the questions they're gonna be asking me

<inaudible>

Really

what'll happen is we're, I'll Go to [PERSON-12] and our coo and that's who

really if I tell [PERSON-10] it's [ORG-1], this is within budget. She goes great. Do you have any questions? No, [PERSON-1]. You're confident. Yes, [PERSON-8]. Is it good on the Financial side? Yes. Ok. This is doable and then we sign it. Um like the questions I'm gonna get from [PERSON-12] and [PERSON-12] are, does it Work? And where does it integrate? Um and I think the [ORG-1], I could say, hey, if we need to put data in there, we can do it, there might be a fee but we can get whatever we want in there. Um

and as long as I can speak to look, they can, you've shown it to me already, you can match our process, help us improve it. Um We can get certain reports that we need to and ease of use is there? Um Meaning like

it'll my reps up to, hey, do this today. They have tasks, it intelligently pushes them through the Sales funnel like helps them Work their opportunities. Great. That's what we're looking for. Um Those are the questions. I have to be able to, answer

<inaudible>

Yeah.

So if we're looking at these numbers on the first one, like let's say we hold up on the training piece and we don't wanna Bring on those users yet. Um So on the High end, we'd be looking somewhere around the 45,000 mark for the soft in the Sales Cloud, then we add in [PERSON-6]'s Implementation. That could be another 45 K that could put you at 125 and you're talking about that could be 61 K that puts us at 1 61 all in including is

that and

that's my question is if I if we have to have that Financial integrator tool because I mean [PERSON-6] tell me if we do or we don't because

in that diagram,

I don't see where

that Financial tool comes into play because if I can build my Price book in [ORG-1] and quote out of [ORG-1] and then my stuff will flow back to [ORG-6]. I'm done. I don't have to have that third party financials tool, that

[ORG-8] tool to subscription management. Um and some reporting for me. But if subscription management and reporting can happen within [ORG-1] or, push back to Netsuite. Great. You then I don't need that tool. Um But that's where y'all gotta tell me. Do I have, do I need an integrator for financials or Not? Because I don't, I don't understand no,

from [ORG-9], so no [NORP-1] is that replacement for you? So [NORP-1] is like if you if you ask a [ORG-10] person at Your company and they say [NORP-1], they probably their eyes would light up like [NORP-1], just a shiny toy that allows you to do a P I management. So I'm thinking about Your sequel database on a WS like Your actual Product like that can be managed in [NORP-1] too. Like the power of [NORP-1] is so vast and this is the foundation to be able to scale Your business and throw that out the

window. Yeah, I just, I don't understand because like here's my simpleton perspective is I have the [DATE-15] Price book. I have the [DATE-12] Price book. I need renewals. Like [DATE-17] renewal should reference this upcoming year Price book. And as long as that quote can automatically be built and reference this upcoming year Price book with a little bit of logic, meaning quantities. If there was

a

yeah, like automatically pull that stuff into the quote. Boom. That's all I need and I need it to quote, be tied to an Opportunity. Have my reps be able to access that document and then just they Go would do their Work with tasks and fun stuff. But that's the stuff I'm looking for that third party integrator. Perfect. But then yeah like [PERSON-6] said

that's no for me.

Ok, perfect. So

and

I was saying [PERSON-4], will you do a little digging just to see if we're taking on pulling all the stuff and if that's gonna affect Pricing much, I mean we put out a range so like it still should fall close but if it just affects, we just let us know. Yeah, for

sure. I think it's more about like how many objects

are we trying to move? If

we talk about [PERSON-9] book, that's gonna be a few extra stuff. I can sync with [PERSON-6] on the side as well because he did a lot of the scoping but I don't think it'll drastically affect it. It might slightly affect it like it's like a small percentage.

Yeah and I included to be honest based on the [ORG-12], I included that already in I figured that was gonna be the case. And so that's included in the 45,000 that I quoted you. So but yeah, from a real soft a P I perspective, we can figure that on the back end.

Um and [PERSON-1] just another thing to do in terms of from Your Sales efficiency perspective, you guys use [ORG-12] [DATE-1] and what we would also do is integrate [ORG-1] into [ORG-12]. And so it's a very cool integration Now that they have is like you, whenever an Opportunity is Updated, you get a ping in [ORG-12] so [ORG-12] can. [ORG-1], Your single source of truth. But [ORG-12] is the way you communicate to [ORG-1]. So they probably are in [ORG-12] [DATE-12] and every day

anyway. Yeah,

perfect.

Ok. Uh So in terms of next steps, you have everything in front of you, have Pricing, you need to have some internal conversations there. I know we initially talked about reconvening around the 12th or 17th. Does that still seem like appropriate timeline to say you have those internal discussions discuss with and [PERSON-12] and then we all convene or just you convene with us to give us the Feedback. What do you think

there? Um trying to look at the calendar?

You can't make it you

what's going on? What's

I'm gonna say [DATE-17]

will probably

be follow up or like on [DATE-19] would probably be [DATE-23] for us to sync back out. Um I'm out again like [DATE-20], but really, that gives me [DATE-24] to do some stuff with my team decisions and that, so it's [DATE-22] we have a decision and then Go, that'd be really nice.

Um Got it. And one question that my team leadership is gonna ask me is when we, can meet on [DATE-23], is that gonna be something where we are ready to make a decision on? You know, this

could be, yeah, it, will either be if I can get my stuff done. Um It'll be, yeah, let's Start talking about solidify timelines and contracts or it'll be, hey, yeah, we went with

somebody else.

Um but I'll keep

you in. Yeah. And

to the point I made like requests for more

information. We'll see. Yeah, perfect. Um I'm good with that and to the point I made on the previous calls, just transparency again. I know you're evaluating

[PERSON-15]. They're Not the one stop shop. So maybe you pulled in other vendors for that second piece too. But as you continue to have those discussions, just keep us in the loop. Um. If it's something over [PERSON-9] or if it's something over specific features or Implementation time or whatever it is, just let us know. So we at least have a stab at anything that could sway you another

way. Yeah, sounds good. I can do

that. Perfect. Um If there's anything else we can do to help you with this, just let us know if it's like matters of calculating [PERSON-12] on the investment, we have lots of statistics with people who've worked in [PRODUCT-1] or [FAC-1] or in house and switched over to us and statistically like they Increased in, you know, time or time efficiency, things like that, whatever you need from us, we're

here to help this point there. Yeah, I appreciate it.

Thank you. Alrighty. Have

a good one. You take Your trial.

Bye bye. I I do that something after you Go last.
""","All right. So yeah, really the premise of the Call is we focus on Sales quoting and then that Financial integration piece kind of those, we broke those out into three different phases for you, [PERSON-1]. Uh Because, you know, based on the conversations, that's really what the meat is and what we're looking at here, at least what the immediate need is for you.

Um and you know, really the big idea and something we wanted to drive home is Sales. We wanna create a single source of truth for Your Sales people and eventually Your entire organization. But initially, with Your use case, just the Sales people and we want to improve efficiency By doing so Increased Revenue, increase margins and then also be able to identify and capture ongoing trends to be able to report and analyze and iterate and improve.

Uh So that's kind of the overall picture of what we're trying to do here

and just to walk you through. So

I know we, we've been talking about this and it looks a lot like [PERSON-2] probably. And I know that this is you want something sexier, you want something like fender

vendors actually built on [ORG-1]. So we, I mean, we can create that exact thing. They're a huge customer of [ORG-1]. Um But this is kind of the out of the box like this is what you get the graphs, the tabular approach the you get, you know, we can have the [DATE-1]'s tasks, [DATE-1]'s events, key different deals and you can make this and configure it and customize it to Your liking.

Um But what I really wanted to drive home here is like, this is the, I think about it. I've been thinking about analogies from a guitar perspective because that's what's just been in my head. It's like this is if you Go to [ORG-2] and I'm a beginner guitar player and I wanna just pick up guitar and play it, you know, maybe every week or so.

Uh this is where I would Go to [ORG-2] and this, you get the out of the box solution. This is like the hubspot's the pipe drives of the world where you can't really customize it. You can't really configure it is what you get.

Uh and [ORG-1] is like going to fender where you can, you know, you get much more bang for Your buck. It's gonna be, yes, probably more expensive. But you're gonna have reliability, you're gonna have customer care, you're going to have Actually a good Product that you're gonna use [DATE-2]. And that's from someone that's gonna use [DATE-3]. And that's what we want to drive adoption at euphoria. We don't want someone to log into [DATE-4] and say,

what's going on in my accounts, we want someone to be able to log in and this is the first thing they see and this is what they're using every day. And so we kind of come up with a rendering. Uh We took Your website actually the little, I think that's a cat or a fox. Um,

just to show you and we can make this as pretty as we want it. This is something I put together, but we can create this as Your home page. So this is something that the Sales rep walk in and we can make it as, maybe some people say cliche a where Your report cards or Your reports, you know, because I'm thinking about teachers, how teachers will respond to the software, you know, s could be Open cases within [ORG-3] that we can push into [ORG-1]. So they can see Open deer.

The tensions would be the huge red flags. Oh my God, this is a red account. This is, they're Not gonna renew. We need to address this right away and these would all be buttons, you know, you can create a New account right from here. It would pop up. Hey, enter the account, name, whatever details you wanna enter, New opportunities, New quotes, New contracts, all of this can be something that, you know, make it as colorful and have as many graphics as you want on there. And

just wanted to get Your thoughts on this if this is something that you were expecting to see and this is what you're, you know, you know, when you see a type of interface for you. I mean,

that's Not exactly what I'm talking about. If we Go back to that first page, it's fine. Like I'm literally just saying softer edges

that looks like that's industrial to me compared to like a [PRODUCT-1] or a pipe drive, right? It's just looks like a more modern application those other two do. Whereas this to me is a little antiquated. It's Not that big a deal as long as we can get the Work done. That's just like, hey, yeah, if you put some lipstick on, it would be nice. I'd then I'd rather take you out to dinner, you know. Um

Yeah, putting lipstick on a pig.

Yeah.

Ok.

Yeah, we can, I mean Yeah, like if it's Not a big deal, you know, I don't wanna harp on it but this is something we can absolutely do. And I got emojis and what, whatever you want we can do, we can make that. Yeah. It's

just like, as long as it's, this page is responsive and move cards around the chart is dynamic, meaning I, and there's. It'll Work, you know, it doesn't have to load or drive into another page before I can see information. That's kind of my expectation and just have it feel fluid, Not systemic, like updating and then just pop up like give me a motion graphic so that it looks smooth when the charts populating or whatever. That's again, Not that important

<inaudible>

just to be able to Work in it.

So, yeah, and that's something that, you know, if

we were to move forward, that

my team would do a lot more Photoshop renderings and get Your entire Sales process and flow and build that out with you. So that's Not a problem.

Um

So moving on to the meat of it really, this is the first phase how we broke it out, which is Your basic Sales Cloud, which is Your CRM. Um and what this is gonna do is import all of Your data over. It's gonna configure Your accounts, which would they be school districts By counties or however that

may be different

leads, opportunities, contacts all of that. We would do the custom branding like you're mentioning there with creating software edges, creating logos and all of that email integration into [ORG-4] or Outlook, whatever you guys use as well as calendar integration,

data cleansing is something that was really important for you. And we wanna be able to put a process in place to be able to track different teachers moving to different schools. And so that's something that we will include there too. And then just Your basic quality assurance, making sure everything works and then training for Your team as well we include and that's gonna be [MONEY-1] to do that Implementation.

OK?

And this is this is phase one. So this is let's get on the [ORG-1] platform. Let's make sure all the data is there. Let's make sure it matches that euphoria process. Let's make sure the colors are there and we can build out the basic approvals and flows from there as well. The second piece is and before I do you have any other questions on this, I'll send this to you in a follow

up but no, Not right Now.

OK?

And then here is phase two, which is Your basic Sales Cloud one prior adding on that pri the Pricing and quoting feature. So creating that Price book of Your products portfolio, creating the opportunities automatically upon a renewal or a signature of a quote, anything like that, generating a PDF document for quotes and then also routing that to e signature platform like a docusign or a

or whatever you may use [DATE-1]. Uh approval routing. So hey, if the discount percentage is X, then [PERSON-1] needs to get eyes on it and click approve before it [ORG-5] out all of that jazz as well as all the different rations of custom fields, basically the entire quoting process within

euphoria and that's gonna be [MONEY-2]. These aren't separate. So

I phase

one, phase two includes phase one and phase two. So these are just different options for you if you just wanted to do one or if you wanted to do two or

three.

Mm

and then the last one, which is the one we recommend, which is the complete integration. This is the, you know, the full enchilada, this is doing the entire [PRODUCT-2], doing the entire Price books. But then also Now we're looking at the integration into [PERSON-2]. So we're looking at bidirectional sync between [PERSON-2] and [ORG-1] to populate accounts, invoices, financials contacts

orders and then also historical data migration. We want you to be able to every past invoice you have as well. We wanna push that into [ORG-1] too. So you have a record of it being again that [ORG-1] is gonna be Your single source of truth. And this the total package really what? So all three of them together if you wanna do it is $[MONEY-3] from our side.

And that

includes training for from Your team, whether that be [TIME-1] webinars or luncheons or in person training sessions, all of that stuff is included. And

the way that we Price things out as a consulting firm ourselves is we do a cost Not to exceed. So this estimate is a cost Not to exceed $[MONEY-3]. Everything that we promise you and everything that you want, we are going to do, even if it costs us more time, we will eat [TIME-2] and we will Not let it Go above $[MONEY-3]. So that's Your maximum investment from the Implementation

side,

ok?

And then wanted to just show you and I'll send you this. So you have it. But you were curious about maybe this was Your Financial person as well as how it is gonna Work. Uh This is kind of an architectural diagram of the integration between [ORG-1] and [ORG-6] and kind of what a pis within the engine to be able to do that is gonna be [NORP-1]. And so it'll kind of show you the process of here's Your Price book and [PERSON-2], it's gonna push into [ORG-1].

Account created and Updated. If you create an account in [ORG-6] or [ORG-1], it'll always be refreshed

opportunities. Close one. So a rep goes in, they have an Opportunity within [ORG-1]. They click close one, they send a contract, it'll push instantly to [ORG-1] or to [ORG-6] in the background and create that invoice and create that order to remit payments from Your finance team. And then on the back end, once the payment is completed, you'll be able to have a complete view of that within [ORG-1].

OK?

Just to give you a visualization on how

it would Work. Yeah.

Um and then just the last piece here, biggest piece timeline. I know Your Go to market was really [DATE-5] is what you really wanted to target. And so I put here a Start Date is [DATE-6]. We can push this down a little bit depending on approvals on Your side of the house. But if we Start in [DATE-7], we can have everything done and be training Your team on it By [DATE-8] and have them fully functional. Yeah.

Oh, that's it from my side. Uh I know that was a lot and I'll send you this. But any initial thoughts, questions,

I mean, it's just a quoting thing with Price books is what I like. Can't, you gotta understand that's important to us and ease of use. There is a, is a thing. Um and remember I'm Not on the Financial side, I understand my team creates records that end up impacting those guys, but we, I'm Not a counter. Um and that's where I'm kinda hung up is

because for me, Price books, that's a netsuite thing. We're moving away from [ORG-6] and I literally just need records to Go back to Netsuite. Like,

what's I just don't understand it. Like, could I, how [PERSON-3] into [ORG-1]? Could we Live autonomously without having to reference [PERSON-2]? Like because I'd rather build it in [ORG-1] and have like the invoice record or whatever, push out with items rather than referencing rather than it being the other way. Like [ORG-6] doesn't need to be my reference. I need [ORG-1] to be my reference and have [PERSON-2] and the information and then like following Your Price books or however that's set up

that just trickles down the next, Not vice versa. Um Does that, does that make sense?

Yeah, [PERSON-4], did you wanna touch on that one? Is that it

I mean it depends on how you wanna build it out, right? I think [PERSON-5] will or [PERSON-6], sorry [PERSON-6] will talk about this. If if you'd like to, you can build it however you want [ORG-1] can be the kind of starter of or the where the data lives that we can be the where the data lives and you can have them reference each other. You don't have to keep it up to Date if you don't like. It's just it's just preference, right? It this is the architecture they built out that you can get

to tweak and update to how you actually want the data to Live.

Yeah.

Yeah. And going along with that. So [PERSON-7] is was an acquisition By [ORG-1]. [NORP-1] is an agnostic Product saying that [NORP-1] is

it can tie into [PERSON-2] or it can tie into [ORG-1]. And so that's what [PERSON-4] was saying that the data can Live wherever you want it to be. But with [ORG-1], Your Sales people being in there, we want [ORG-1] to be that single source of truth to eventually be able to say

hey, let's give our accounting team access to [ORG-1] to where they can just send quotes out inside [ORG-1] and then [ORG-6], like maybe the CFO has a license so he can just Go in and be able to have access to it and we don't even have to log in to [ORG-6] if we don't

want to. Exactly. That's, that's the thing. Right is like, if, so we're moving away from [ORG-6]. I want everything stored in [ORG-1] and if we say peace out [ORG-6], we're Not doing financials over there, we're going to Quick Books, ok? We'll just set up the integration with Quick books. Now you, know what I mean and then all the Financial report, whatever happens By Quick Books or some other Financial tool, that's,

that's the goal, that's what I wanna make sure is [ORG-1] can stand up and quote and do all that stuff independently without that Financial system for certain components.

So we,

yeah, it will and what soft will do on the back end is make sure that wherever that data needs to be sent for financials or for kind of processing that it gets sent there, but it can Live in [ORG-1] when something Changes gets pushed to [ORG-6] or pushed to Quick Books or pushed to whatever you make Your Financial system a record in the future and have that flexibility without having to rip and replace a bunch of integrations.

<inaudible>

Yeah, and just be just be transparent with us like you're saying this is a piece you're a little bit hesitant on. Well, is it just us saying yes, we can do this or is it gonna take more than that? Just make you feel really comfortable? Like let us know so we can put you in a position where you feel like OK, this is the absolute solution

to solve this problem,

you know? No,

I, I don't remember the other guy's name and showed me, hey, yeah, here. So you add an item and it's click, add item and type in the dates. That's what I'm looking to do. And as long as I can, a certain Product Price here, great. I need it to be that easy. Um

I mean, I do have questions about reports but they're like, it's nothing crazy. Like I'm looking for a like turn By item. Tell me what people dropped [DATE-9] of what they didn't renew By item. Not By, yes, I wanna drill into the customer but as a whole who didn't renew this software line it and what's the value like that? That's what I would like to see. I'm confident we can get those reports in the system. So Not that worried about it. Um

<inaudible>

yeah, I mean, the think about it like I just, we just did this for a client [DATE-10] who wanted interactive dashboards on a home page. And so we created almost, I think the example I use was [ORG-7]. You know, if you're on Zillow dot com, looking for a home, you can filter By how many bedrooms By single family By square feet. Like we can do that inside Sales force from an accounting and reporting perspective. That's all very easily

done. Ok. Cool. That's what I'm figuring if I can do it in netsuite. And I know I can, it's just a, that I can probably figure it out in Sales too. Uh, I just don't know how it displays and the logic to get there yet, but that's ok. Ok. Cool.

Yeah. And then just something to note too. I know you wanted to be, have something that's,

you guys can manage Your Own and Riley if you specifically are the one that's gonna be managing it. And so you can be as involved or is Not involved in our Implementation process as you like. So you can, you can get an understanding if you wanna Go at the end and say, OK, I just wanna know how everything works and if I need to change some things around, I can do that, you guys can be involved in that

or if you want to be on every single one of our calls, we do [DATE-12] stand ups through teams where you can Go in and it, it's a whole process, you can be involved or is Not involved as you

want, got you and then configuration in that stuff. Like Not that worried about as long as that's what I need to make sure it's done the right

way.

Um What I, what [PERSON-8] and I need to know is if like if we need to change Your process, we want it to be a native process. Like continue to Work well just within the Ecosystem

but be able to maybe make a small tweet. Um and when we make that tweak, we don't want to have to Go then create [LOC-1] that doesn't Work on reports or can only be filtered and seen from this specific view. Like when we build something we want it to be.

Universal pervasive throughout the system accessible on all the reports, all the views, etcetera and Not have to create a [LOC-2] that references another [LOC-2]. And then this see it on a report like one out of the box functionality to Work and be able to tweak it just to

I mean

that's you're describing [ORG-1], I think,

right?

So,

OK, cool. Um What else we got here?

Let me OK, I think you're on mute. I'm sorry about

that. I said I'll Go ahead and share my screen Now. Um and there is a bit of a some range to this Pricing too. Um which [PERSON-4] may be able to speak to you a little about soft side, but give me [TIME-3].

Got you. Yeah,

I don't find that.

So this is an annual Price and I threw out two options just in case you did wanna Bring on eight users from like the training aspect. I threw that in there too because it wasn't a High fee. So

there's a, there's a few things to consider here and first off, if we're looking at [PRODUCT-3] licenses, that's the list [PERSON-9]. This is the discount [DATE-12] total. [NORP-1] range somewhere on the, this is ballpark 33 to 32

an [DATE-12] fee here. Um a couple things to think of. Uh so on the soft side, like if this doesn't fit within budget, there's certain things that we can change and adjust to get to a lower Price point or things out. Like on the side, if we were to reduce the amount of flows that can lower the Price on the [ORG-1] side, if we were to reduce the amount of licenses that could change the Price. I know you also mentioned

where you were using that was about a $[MONEY-4] fee. We could look at evaluating Quickbooks online to potentially Bring another Price, Not said that will or won't. Um That's just another option too. One other alternative

is sometimes and part of this falls back to

one thing like so right Now, we feel like we're at a good spot where in the evaluation where it makes sense to Start sharing Pricing with you, we've gotten far enough down the tunnel to Start sharing Pricing. Um But when I Go to leadership for things like discounting, they asked me like, OK, how does this still get done? Um and like

who signs and things like that. So I know you're the one running point on this and do all the due diligence. I don't know if you Bring that to [PERSON-10] and she signs off or if you have to Bring that to someone like a CFO, but those are the questions they're gonna be asking me

<inaudible>

Really

what'll happen is we're, I'll Go to [PERSON-12] and our coo and that's who

really if I tell [PERSON-10] it's [ORG-1], this is within budget. She goes great. Do you have any questions? No, [PERSON-1]. You're confident. Yes, [PERSON-8]. Is it good on the Financial side? Yes. Ok. This is doable and then we sign it. Um like the questions I'm gonna get from [PERSON-12] and [PERSON-12] are, does it Work? And where does it integrate? Um and I think the [ORG-1], I could say, hey, if we need to put data in there, we can do it, there might be a fee but we can get whatever we want in there. Um

and as long as I can speak to look, they can, you've shown it to me already, you can match our process, help us improve it. Um We can get certain reports that we need to and ease of use is there? Um Meaning like

it'll my reps up to, hey, do this today. They have tasks, it intelligently pushes them through the Sales funnel like helps them Work their opportunities. Great. That's what we're looking for. Um Those are the questions. I have to be able to, answer

<inaudible>

Yeah.

So if we're looking at these numbers on the first one, like let's say we hold up on the training piece and we don't wanna Bring on those users yet. Um So on the High end, we'd be looking somewhere around the 45,000 mark for the soft in the Sales Cloud, then we add in [PERSON-6]'s Implementation. That could be another 45 K that could put you at 125 and you're talking about that could be 61 K that puts us at 1 61 all in including is

that and

that's my question is if I if we have to have that Financial integrator tool because I mean [PERSON-6] tell me if we do or we don't because

in that diagram,

I don't see where

that Financial tool comes into play because if I can build my Price book in [ORG-1] and quote out of [ORG-1] and then my stuff will flow back to [ORG-6]. I'm done. I don't have to have that third party financials tool, that

[ORG-8] tool to subscription management. Um and some reporting for me. But if subscription management and reporting can happen within [ORG-1] or, push back to Netsuite. Great. You then I don't need that tool. Um But that's where y'all gotta tell me. Do I have, do I need an integrator for financials or Not? Because I don't, I don't understand no,

from [ORG-9], so no [NORP-1] is that replacement for you? So [NORP-1] is like if you if you ask a [ORG-10] person at Your company and they say [NORP-1], they probably their eyes would light up like [NORP-1], just a shiny toy that allows you to do a P I management. So I'm thinking about Your sequel database on a WS like Your actual Product like that can be managed in [NORP-1] too. Like the power of [NORP-1] is so vast and this is the foundation to be able to scale Your business and throw that out the

window. Yeah, I just, I don't understand because like here's my simpleton perspective is I have the [DATE-15] Price book. I have the [DATE-12] Price book. I need renewals. Like [DATE-17] renewal should reference this upcoming year Price book. And as long as that quote can automatically be built and reference this upcoming year Price book with a little bit of logic, meaning quantities. If there was

a

yeah, like automatically pull that stuff into the quote. Boom. That's all I need and I need it to quote, be tied to an Opportunity. Have my reps be able to access that document and then just they Go would do their Work with tasks and fun stuff. But that's the stuff I'm looking for that third party integrator. Perfect. But then yeah like [PERSON-6] said

that's no for me.

Ok, perfect. So

and

I was saying [PERSON-4], will you do a little digging just to see if we're taking on pulling all the stuff and if that's gonna affect Pricing much, I mean we put out a range so like it still should fall close but if it just affects, we just let us know. Yeah, for

sure. I think it's more about like how many objects

are we trying to move? If

we talk about [PERSON-9] book, that's gonna be a few extra stuff. I can sync with [PERSON-6] on the side as well because he did a lot of the scoping but I don't think it'll drastically affect it. It might slightly affect it like it's like a small percentage.

Yeah and I included to be honest based on the [ORG-12], I included that already in I figured that was gonna be the case. And so that's included in the 45,000 that I quoted you. So but yeah, from a real soft a P I perspective, we can figure that on the back end.

Um and [PERSON-1] just another thing to do in terms of from Your Sales efficiency perspective, you guys use [ORG-12] [DATE-1] and what we would also do is integrate [ORG-1] into [ORG-12]. And so it's a very cool integration Now that they have is like you, whenever an Opportunity is Updated, you get a ping in [ORG-12] so [ORG-12] can. [ORG-1], Your single source of truth. But [ORG-12] is the way you communicate to [ORG-1]. So they probably are in [ORG-12] [DATE-12] and every day

anyway. Yeah,

perfect.

Ok. Uh So in terms of next steps, you have everything in front of you, have Pricing, you need to have some internal conversations there. I know we initially talked about reconvening around the 12th or 17th. Does that still seem like appropriate timeline to say you have those internal discussions discuss with and [PERSON-12] and then we all convene or just you convene with us to give us the Feedback. What do you think

there? Um trying to look at the calendar?

You can't make it you

what's going on? What's

I'm gonna say [DATE-17]

will probably

be follow up or like on [DATE-19] would probably be [DATE-23] for us to sync back out. Um I'm out again like [DATE-20], but really, that gives me [DATE-24] to do some stuff with my team decisions and that, so it's [DATE-22] we have a decision and then Go, that'd be really nice.

Um Got it. And one question that my team leadership is gonna ask me is when we, can meet on [DATE-23], is that gonna be something where we are ready to make a decision on? You know, this

could be, yeah, it, will either be if I can get my stuff done. Um It'll be, yeah, let's Start talking about solidify timelines and contracts or it'll be, hey, yeah, we went with

somebody else.

Um but I'll keep

you in. Yeah. And

to the point I made like requests for more

information. We'll see. Yeah, perfect. Um I'm good with that and to the point I made on the previous calls, just transparency again. I know you're evaluating

[PERSON-15]. They're Not the one stop shop. So maybe you pulled in other vendors for that second piece too. But as you continue to have those discussions, just keep us in the loop. Um. If it's something over [PERSON-9] or if it's something over specific features or Implementation time or whatever it is, just let us know. So we at least have a stab at anything that could sway you another

way. Yeah, sounds good. I can do

that. Perfect. Um If there's anything else we can do to help you with this, just let us know if it's like matters of calculating [PERSON-12] on the investment, we have lots of statistics with people who've worked in [PRODUCT-1] or [FAC-1] or in house and switched over to us and statistically like they Increased in, you know, time or time efficiency, things like that, whatever you need from us, we're

here to help this point there. Yeah, I appreciate it.

Thank you. Alrighty. Have

a good one. You take Your trial.

Bye bye. I I do that something after you Go last.
