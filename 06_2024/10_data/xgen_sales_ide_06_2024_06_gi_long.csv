012731_167_0LQ3y000009NyzkGAC,"EndUser: Because we have a bunch of landing pages set up and partners with different software spaces, with different software spaces.
EndUser: Basically how we do is, first we hit all the leads, we put on a spreadsheet, we hit all the leads there, my brother does, and then he sent them to me, I hit them again, and then I had them set them to one third person, and if we don't get it, the third person pretty much just tosses away all the old leads because they're obviously, we don't want the kids to do this.
Agent: So you attempt them three times after that, they just fall off.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, because that means. A lot of the spaces that we set a merchant account for are like, you know, like, credit-repared debt relief, tax mitigation lawyers that like, little sketchy stuff.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So, I mean, like, if they don't want to do it on the third call, we don't really want the business.
Agent: Well, let me ask you about the top of the funnel.
Agent: So how are you getting leads coming at the top of the funnel?
EndUser: We have landing pages set up with a different [PRODUCT-1]. A lot of them are built off go high level, but just wide level.
Agent: So you just got like websites essentially for merchant to, it's all inbound then, right?
EndUser: Have some of the things that we've done in the past.
Agent: You don't do any prospecting or anything like that.
EndUser: Not anymore. I mean, we've been, like my brother's in [DATE-1], and I've been doing this for three.
EndUser: And our partners just send us all the leads pretty much, because they all get a percentage off and all the processing fees.
Agent: Yeah, and did you say you're managing all this off of a spreadsheet?
EndUser: Yeah, our cell phones.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It's not that, because the thing is different about us is that we always, we always try to mention, it's like, you get our cell phones.
EndUser: So like, and they literally do, so I get dumb calls all the time for dumb stuff for 21-L-A charges, but it's fine. I don't mind.
Agent: Okay, I'm just saying. Well, I still think there might be some room for us to help out here, actually.
Agent: And I don't want to take up too much of your time right now so that this college out of the blue.
Agent: Would you be open to scheduling like [TIME-1] conversation to talk a little bit more in depth about it, maybe [DATE-2] or in [DATE-3] sometime?
EndUser: Is your serum like go high level at all?
Agent: Yeah, so we have a lot of different tools that we can use depending on sort of what the needs are for our client. But yeah, our [PRODUCT-1] does everything.
Agent: Like I said, it's the most used [PRODUCT-1] in the world. We have hundreds of thousands of companies that use it from a small mom and pop shop, so all the way up to Enterprise companies.
Agent: So I really can do anything.
Agent: So when you say, is it high level, what do you mean by it?
Agent: Is it high level?
EndUser: No, like go high level, like go [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Oh, similar to that [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I'm actually not familiar with go high level. I can look into it and see what kind of similarities there are.
Agent: But do you like go high level, or are you not happy with that particular serum right now?
EndUser: No, because like one of the ideas we had, because we have between me and my brother and a couple of one other guy here, we probably have over like 381 [ORG-1] or credit repair companies in [GPE-1] under our portfolio.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: And we want to create our own [PRODUCT-1]. So we're going to buy the license on white label, go high level.
Agent: Okay. What
EndUser: But I don't know if we're going to do that for sure yet.
EndUser: So I was wondering, can you white label sales for us or no?
Agent: Do you do?
Agent: What do you do?
Agent: I like white label it.
EndUser: Like, white label is that we pretty much just use your software and say it's ours. You buy the license for it. That's what it's.
EndUser: That's what, and we kind of like resell it in the sense for people to use. That's what a go-high level does.
Agent: Interesting. Okay. So there might be so you're saying you would license it and then sell it to like your partners.
EndUser: No, we, not our partners, we sell it to basically business owners. To the finish we have, we have partners in other software spaces or other CRMs, specifically for different spaces, let me know for it.
EndUser: Like credit repair, like I said, really taxing stuff like that. That have special programs built into it that help use tools for the [ORG-2] or the credit repair organization or the get release.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Anyway, so we were thinking of selling our own [PRODUCT-1] where we were just going to buy a license from go-high level so we can pretty much just say it's ours. You have to buy a license from them.
EndUser: And then you like, and then you white-led what it is yours. That's what a lot of companies do. Exactly.
Agent: I understand. Okay, so go high level. So you would buy the license to send to you resell that. to all of the [ORG-1] that you're working with, for example. So the [ORG-1] can use it.
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Got it. I understand. So no, we don't have that option. There's no option for you to sort of license and become a reseller.
Agent: Well, I mean, I guess there are some options for that, but I think it's a little bit more complex than what the Go High level is offering. Really, our bread and butter is to help you, for example.
Agent: Like we would help you get leads like top of funnel. We would help you do marketing. We would help you close at a higher rate than you are currently. Make the sales cycle faster.
Agent: So that's really where our bread and butter is at. We started with the [PRODUCT-1], but like I said, we since expanded to all kinds of other different products. We do marketing.
Agent: We do service if you have existing clients that you retain. We do a lot with AI. I don't know if you've looked into sort of the [PRODUCT-2] and how that could potentially help your business.
Agent: So there's a lot of things that we can help out with, but if you're looking strictly to kind of realise a [PRODUCT-1], unfortunately, I don't think that's an option with [ORG-3].
EndUser: Yeah, I mean honestly, like what you're asking isn't really my call. You know, it would be up to the owners if they call it not myself. I mean, I'm just the salesperson here.
EndUser: It does, it does mention reps, so it really wouldn't be up to me. They let us kind of do whatever we want. I mean, you can go after any type of industry, doesn't really matter.
EndUser: We just thrive in the financial industry, so sketchy. And my.
Agent: A lot of people actually talk to salespeople because of what a understanding experience of the people who are using technology. A lot of times the decision makers aren't even using the technology that you are, for example.
Agent: And so if I talk to you and you say, hey, yeah, this program we're using is not really good. It's really inefficient. It's time consuming.
Agent: Then I have some type of perspective to bring to people who actually make decisions. And I can say, hey, look, I talked to your sales team. They're saying what you use right now is kind of trash.
Agent: There's a lot of room for improvement here. Here's what we do instead and how this could save them time, how this can improve their close rate, things like that.
Agent: So again, if you have, you know, [TIME-2] and we'll take up too much of your time, maybe sometime [DATE-2].
EndUser: And, have thought of the
Agent: We'd love to connect with you. We just talked through a little bit more how you're using technology and see if there's some way we can help out with it.
EndUser: Like, I mean, I don't mind talking to people really. Like, it's all good. Like, whatever, it's fine.
EndUser: But I just, to be honest with you, I just, what we do here, I don't think you can help with it, if that makes sense.
EndUser: Just because like, we're very hands-on, like keeping people compliant or running their businesses, especially the type of high-risk Industries that we're in.
EndUser: Because it's very, I don't know if you're familiar with processors, but what the same level is [NORP-1], [ORG-4], and well as far as [ORG-5], or [ORG-6]. So, but we're a lot smaller.
EndUser: With a lot more high risk industry. So a lot of our merchants, they call us on our cell phones to handle stuff for them, to keep them alive so they can keep running the business.
EndUser: It's not as simple as just the sales cycle. Like it's not, it's a lot more complicated and a lot more hands on.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That's why like it's easier for me to keep a smaller book and then have, you know, it's not like the car industry when I sell a car and it's done or you follow up five times.
Agent: Yeah, it's not like a volume based industry, right?
EndUser: You get everything?
Agent: So it's, yeah.
EndUser: No, it's a lot more personable, like a lot more.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, and keeping these businesses alive. Like, yeah, we have one two stand alone, like a lot of like restaurants, smoke shops, things like that.
EndUser: Those are easy, I never have to touch, but like the Industries that we're in, like it's a lot more hands-on because these domestic car can come shut you off, whatever.
EndUser: So our job is to make sure we, it's like a high wire act, if that makes sense.
Agent: Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I still think there might be some way we can help you out here, actually. And we don't just do volume.
Agent: You know, so I mean, one of the things we do is help.
EndUser: Here.
Agent: Companies increase the number of leads, but not all companies want to do that.
Agent: And it sounds like maybe you're in a similar position where you don't want a ton more leads because it's you have such a high touch business.
Agent: But I think there's ways for us to help maybe streamline what you're doing. Like if you're working on the back of an [PRODUCT-3] spreadsheet, which a lot of our customers do, there's certainly ways that we can help that.
Agent: With that.
Agent: Just make it more efficient for you, give you a better view of all your accounts and all your clients, make it easier for you to manage them, make it easier for you to do any Outreach if you need to, easier to respond to them, things like that.
EndUser: Profile simply and that will slide.
Agent: So, if we had another conversation, if it turned out we're not a good fit for you, I'll absolutely let you know because it's really meant to be a partnership.
Agent: We want to help you, but if we're not the best fit, I'll just say, hey, you're right, maybe this isn't the best type of technology for you to use.
Agent: But again, if you need [TIME-2] [DATE-4], we can make that decision and see if it's even worth pursuing after that.
EndUser: Yeah, I'll do that, bro. I'll do that.
EndUser: I mean, I'm in the same same place as you, you know what I mean?
EndUser: Like just co-com people trying to make it happen, you know.
Agent: I appreciate that, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: So I'll give you the time, bro.
Agent: Yeah, man, I won't take too much time. I know you're busy and your husband is [DATE-5]. So let me send you an email. You're at [FAC-1] at BankCardUSA.
EndUser: Yeah, just do it. Just probably just call me at [DATE-6] at [DATE-7] and I'll be available.
Agent: Okay. Cool. I'll give you a call then and we can talk for [TIME-2].
Agent: Is there a way that you can show me like the technology you're using like a screen share or something like that?
EndUser: I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a break.
Agent: Because that would be helpful for us. No.
EndUser: Uh-uh.
EndUser: Did you think a lot of this stuff has personal information regarding the business owners?
Agent: I totally understand. I was in the instrument of super long time, so I totally get that. Okay.
EndUser: Who did you work for?
Agent: No worries. Yeah, I worked for [PERSON-2] for [DATE-8].
EndUser: Oh,
Agent: I was a financial advisor there. And then I was also in [ORG-7]. I did startups for [DATE-9].
EndUser: Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha regarding the payments side of the business.
Agent: Yeah. Now, I was never on the payment side of the business. Nope, I was just on the financial advisory side of the business.
EndUser: I mean, we'll chop it up.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, you know, I'm like a friend of mine. But it's you. So I have no problem. It's been [DATE-10] in time.
Agent: Really appreciate that, [PERSON-1]. Hey, thanks again for your time [DATE-9].
EndUser: I'm going two talk to you about.
Agent: Happy new year to you and look forward to connecting you [DATE-2]. Take care.",What problem was the buyer trying to solve?

008652_167_6qr3y000000g2MPAAY,"Agent: Hey, can you hear it?
Agent: I'm assuming to hear you come through. Oh, that's not me. Let me check my settings. I
Agent: Don't. Seriously, we're going to zoom back in here.
Agent: You want to try to jumping on a [ORG-1] me instead?
Agent: I can spin one up and send you an
EndUser: Invite.
Agent: There we go.
EndUser: My data my and how setting for whatever reason I'm still stuck in my headphones.
EndUser: Do you use AirPods?
EndUser: Yeah, AirPods, yeah, I was probably the first set to headphones that I just go back and forth and it just never There's different things that are going to be a little bit of a master.
Agent: It's a It's a story I know all too well. I've got like my work phone. I've got my personal phone. I work laptop and my personal laptop and it never I don't know how they managed to do it.
Agent: I've never seen it connected to the right one on the first go. It's
EndUser: Incredible. I don't know if I'm sorry for being [TIME-1] when I was just running a little behind [DATE-1]. No, no worries.
Agent: I actually was just, I caught your second note when said you were jumping on. So the timing actually worked out pretty well.
Agent: And I just in time, I thought I was going to be [TIME-2] late because my coffee machine was taking a bit. So it worked out perfectly.
Agent: Where have we, I don't remember, have we, I don't know, you know, I was involved with some of your team.
EndUser: With the renewal, but had we spoken or connected before?
EndUser: I don't think so. I don't think so. I think you're probably dealing with some other members of my team.
Agent: Gotcha. Well, really good to me. I know how long it sounds like you've got. It sounds like some contract issues that have come up.
Agent: So, I'm curious to maybe hear a little bit more about that, but just more broadly speaking, I'm the account specialist and I've seen the [ORG-2] specialists.
Agent: And so, for anything Slack-related, whether it's you want to get pointed to some resources, you're hoping to get an intro to somebody, anything I can be helpful with, you can always get free to reach out to me.
Agent: I'm happy to help in any way that I can. So, I'll put that out there and yeah, maybe I'll give the flow to you if you could tell a little bit more about what's going on.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Great to meet you and I'm not sure. but I'll start from scratch. I'll take a step back and play about it. And if anything sounds familiar, feel free to stop me.
EndUser: So I lead business development strategic planning for [ORG-3]. And I just have been working on our, I've been involved in our sales force Implementation or data round Implementation for some time now. I won't give it up. Probably on.
EndUser: Too many details to share, but about just the ebbs and flows we've gone through with that implementation, but long story short, we had a lot of challenges.
EndUser: And we kind of think it was the right product for us for what we needed. I don't think we were given the right Implementation partner. And it just took a long time.
EndUser: You know and we had you know our scope was much larger than that so at [DATE-2] we evaluated it internally and said look I mean there's a path here to continue using data ROM or I guess it's called [ORG-4] now but at [DATE-2] you know it's just going to be a whole lot of work and a whole lot of money for you know not as much of a you know return as we had hoped so Um, you know, we decided to kind of cut our losses on that.
EndUser: Um, and when I, you know, have been kind of communicating with [PERSON-1] and more recently, [PERSON-2], for, um, you know, the past, we're both for a while now and [PERSON-2], for [DATE-3], just kind of keeping them up to date on what's been going on and.
EndUser: It's been really helpful, but when we finally made the decision at [DATE-4], [DATE-5], I started talking about what our options were. Our subscription for that product goes until [DATE-6].
EndUser: So we talked about what we can do to kind of what our options are. Since we've never been able to use
EndUser: And we're not going to. We're kind of like cutting our losses here.
EndUser: So one of the, I think the reason we got connected is because they thought one of the best forward would be to potentially credit what we have left in that subscription toward our slack, you know, subscription.
EndUser: Because, you know, we're very happy with slack. We plan to use it for continue using it. So. I think that was the impetus for this call and to see what options forward there.
EndUser: Maybe, you know, beyond that, we are talking about, well, can we just cut that subscription short and just not pay [DATE-7] or our next couple quarters or whatever?
EndUser: But I think this was their bet that this was the recommendation for the first drop to kind of see, you know, there's something we can do from this angle.
Agent: Gotcha. Well, first, It sounds like you've kind of had [DATE-8] on that front.
Agent: And so sorry in general that you haven't had a positive experience and it hasn't really kind of you haven't really gotten the value from what you paid for and whether that's Enterprise software whether that's buying a house or literally anything like that's just a <inaudible> feeling.
Agent: So so I'm sorry that you guys went through that. I'm kind of bad news is bad news, no matter how you deliver it. So like maybe I'll just leave with that bit.
Agent: I don't think that in this instance, and I appreciate the context is that I didn't get the full context. I don't think in that, in this instance, we're going to be able to help too much.
Agent: Reason being is just because of the way that the contracts operate, but they're like fully separate contracts. And so I found myself in this situation, kind of in the reverse as well, or sometimes, particularly.
Agent: What we saw very frequently was [DATE-9], a huge boom in the work from home industry. And tech companies were just going crazy, the interest rates were low.
Agent: And so there were [DATE-10] contracts where maybe the companies didn't really fully reach the number of users that they were expecting to get to.
Agent: And so we looked at the reverse too, like can we get [ORG-2] spent into some other [ORG-5] products. And unfortunately, I always heard [DATE-1] the answers now, you know, in the coming.
Agent: In [DATE-12], I think, you know, our [DATE-12], [DATE-12], kind of [DATE-15], that may change.
Agent: I think there may be, particularly in [DATE-12], some additional flexibility in terms of potentially getting [ORG-2] and other products onto the same contract to enable those types of, you know, I think what's else which calls them their swaps or kind of reallocating spend without necessarily withdrawing it, but just putting it to something that you get more value from.
Agent: But it sounds like, for the most part, because your contract extends relatively soon, that's probably, if and when those changes go into effect, they're probably not going to go into effect prior to the current contract that you're honest.
Agent: You might remember that correctly.
EndUser: Yeah, what are our contractors for you mean for data [PRODUCT-1] or.
EndUser: Yeah, it expires in like [DATE-17] you said, right?
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: That was a really long winded answer. I just wanted to do the full context because I hate when I'm not able to help. And I hate when I have to say that I'm not able to help so quickly.
Agent: Just because I've kind of gone through similar scenarios before. Um, and, you know, um, that's the, uh, yeah. From that, and I don't think there's going to be as much that I'll be able to do.
Agent: Sorry, that it didn't really have better news for you on that front. That I made you join a call. Yeah, that's all right.
EndUser: I mean, it is what it is and appreciate the context. Yes, I mean, I guess it's just a question back to bow and [PERSON-2], that in your conversation with them.
EndUser: I guess I figured they had discussed it with you and there was a lot of, It was a pass forward there, which is why they made the connection.
Agent: So yeah, so I connected with Bo a little bit earlier, but it's kind of just, I think we've all been running a little bit all over the place. And so I defended them. That's probably on me.
Agent: I should have pushed for some additional context. But yeah, what I'd recommend is reaching out to Bo again, seeing if there's anything to be done. Transparently, and this is, I don't know if I'm gonna bother.",How did the salesperson identify the buyer's specific situation and needs?,"The salesperson identified the buyer's specific situation and needs by asking open-ended questions and actively listening to the buyer's responses.

009526_167_6qr3y000000g3EwAAI,"Agent: You just sent the article to that actually explains this much more succinct than I am right now.
EndUser: But basically,
Agent: Just a quick repeat of it is if your domain is in use only through Marketing cloud, this simple policy defaulted two for certain stacks.
EndUser: Is automatically
Agent: If you're not on that [PRODUCT-1] stack or server, we can enable it for you. It's just a support case.
Agent: And then, so you so it's not default for you guys, but it can be enabled for you just through a support case Um, and then just to reiterate I will because the Recording also takes messages This is the simple policy that gets added to your account and that policy equals reject is something that was talked about before in the email Which is that are in second.
EndUser: Yeah,
EndUser: Enforcement so this is the enforcement of the stricter right saying that hey if unless it comes from, there is. [PERSON-1].
EndUser: Hello. Hey, Hey.
EndUser: [PERSON-1]. Sorry about that. I was. Yeah.
EndUser: Well, I did the best possible impression of you posing as the email expert.
EndUser: Thanks.
EndUser: Why do you?
Agent: You did a great job.
EndUser: All of that. No other call ran over.
EndUser: Problem. Sorry about that. The
EndUser: Yeah. And [PERSON-2] was just about sharing. Sorry, [PERSON-2], not to continue. Sorry, you might have to repeat it the third time now that [PERSON-3].
Agent: It's okay. It's okay. So I'll, I'll paste it as I go along again. So this is the, you know, D mark. policy requirements to send through Marketing cloud.
Agent: What I was just saying before is that this is a very nice digestible article if you get through it.
Agent: Now, I was mentioning before that if your domain is only with [PRODUCT-1] in use through Marketing cloud, we have a simple policy. It's actually the default policy that's applied to certain Marketing Cloud stacks.
Agent: We just confirmed that you're on stack 10, so that's not the default, but it can be turned on by our support.
Agent: So it's just a request to say, hey, although we weren't on those stacks, we just want this policy to be added.
EndUser: That policy, we call it the simple policy, placing it in our chat, will turn these settings on. Yeah, let me. Okay. So,
EndUser: Okay, so this is good because this is actually what I wanted to ask.
EndUser: When we had those policy on before, because right now we have D marks sit on the route, right?
EndUser: So the whole issue was is that when we set it up on the route, I don't know, this is [DATE-1] when I added exactly what you just typed in.
EndUser: It actually broke the [ORG-1] email almost immediately because it wasn't all in alignment correctly. So what we ended up doing was we just put the P equals none essentially in the actual monitored mode and call it a day.
EndUser: Right. We didn't put the AD [PERSON-4], you know, we didn't actually do the adjustments.
EndUser: Now, if you're saying that we can like I can add that into my route without having to add it in on the sales force side, but I would probably just rather have it on the sales force side just to make sure.
Agent: So if you're saying that we can just add a ticket in and get that added that'd be fine, then we then we can go from there. Yeah, so that is a possibility.
EndUser: The other piece
Agent: Of this is that second option is if you know have a policy you were 19 party had built so that you know would also remain on your brief.
Agent: It's something that can also be delegated or sorry not delegated but it can also be configured through our support too by just saying like hey you have all the setup tell us what the correct subdomain is and we'll mash it up.
Agent: So that is something outlined in this article that is possible but if that simple policy is all you need that's something that we can
EndUser: Turn on I just wanna stop for a second and just ask what did you mean by breakage Is it that.. .
EndUser: So initially, this was [DATE-1], when we actually turned it on the route and we use it the exact setting, essentially, what was happening was the [ORG-1] emails. We're getting actually marked a lot of them.
EndUser: We're getting marked as spam because it wasn't actually the SPF was aligned, but for some reason the DKIM wasn't. So it rejected on the DKIM alignment and basically failed the message. So I just checked it [DATE-2].
EndUser: Both the [ORG-1] on the [ORG-2] servers essentially have all the alignment set. So it should be ready to go.
EndUser: But if we just need to put a support ticket in and say, hey, go add this into marketing.savvymoney.com on your [ORG-2] server side of it, then that's good. Then we're salt on our end.
Agent: Gotcha. OK, yeah, I mean, this might be just the solution I mean, yeah, just to make this even easier.
EndUser: On. So
Agent: [PERSON-5], should we just throw that support ticket in?
Agent: So it be e dot. Savvy money dot com that market
EndUser: And then marking money dot.
Agent: Exactly. The only thing the reason I. Sometimes if you're making changes to things, they don't really let to come from the past.
Agent: Me do it. Like it needs
Agent: Yeah, you need to tell us you're we're allowed to make
EndUser: A change to your environment. Okay. We better.
Agent: Okay. Yeah. Cool.
EndUser: Oh, go ahead.
EndUser: Hey, I was just going to say, admit, do you want me to just send you the text and then you can add the ticket in?
EndUser: Me or [PERSON-6], do you want
EndUser: It's there in that chat. So I think So yeah, exactly.
EndUser: That's what we're talking about, right?
EndUser: Yes. So [PERSON-7] can just use that and say, hey, add this to the two domains and call it a day. It shouldn't be a I know, [PERSON-1], you were saying something about Is that last is the last parameter.
EndUser: Fairly state-owned ticket.
EndUser: Percentages, right?
EndUser: Parameter?
EndUser: This is it. The percentage
EndUser: Yeah. So [PERCENT-1] is basically like [TIME-1] that [ORG-1] inserts it's in, it's inactive. Now, since this only affects [ORG-1] side, if it's wrong on [ORG-1], they would know. They'd be able to fix it on their end.
EndUser: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: So, since we were talking [TIME-2], I just want to be doubly sure, right?
EndUser: Just how would we know if this is causing any issues?
EndUser: That's my
EndUser: Ultimate question, right?
EndUser: We know on our side because we track the demarcation on our software. I track the [ORG-1] ones too.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: We will know on our side. Yep.
EndUser: So it's just okay to turn this figured on like this and to see to see what's going to, if at all anything's breaking Okay.
EndUser: Monitor it
EndUser: On that. Exactly.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: And, and
EndUser: [PERSON-2], do you know what the turnaround time for something like this tends to be the I don't need exact numbers, but about time frame.
Agent: Yeah, I actually don't because I don't work with the support team that closely.
Agent: But what I would say is this get it is get it in as soon as possible because later down [DATE-3], it's [DATE-4] and so they if you can do it [DATE-5], that'd be great.
EndUser: Might be swamped. So just I'm going to copy
Agent: I this last portion of this specific article. So let me just give you an article really quick. So that's the article and this is going to be the sport ticket you are asking.
EndUser: Oh, okay, cool. So please
Agent: Submit a support ticket requesting that the simple DMARC option to be enabled and then you just have to provide your mid and your domain. So, MID Marketing Cloud ID and then your domain is e.savvymoney.com and [PERSON-8].
EndUser: Would be your
EndUser: Right.
EndUser: And, We have multiple mid's, though, right?
Agent: Yeah, first, there's your mid.
EndUser: Like units for for.
Agent: We have the remember.
EndUser: You can You may.
Agent: That's going to be turned on for a specific business unit that specific mid. If that's all you're sending out of, turn it on for that one.
Agent: If you want to You can also ask if they can add it to your parent account.
EndUser: Be double.
Agent: To see what they reply there because they may be able to just, you know. umbrella all of them or this may be just specific to that domain just ask
EndUser: Yeah i would do all yeah i was thinking yeah because it will send through i know for it the perfect that if you stool these you know the third one is the one that debate but at this point might as well right yeah okay Good.
EndUser: Of them
EndUser: So I think we've got our answers here.
EndUser: Anything else?
EndUser: Oh, yeah. So it's in question our answer to CUSO no.
EndUser: Until this is done, so [PERSON-1], again. So until this is done, then again, [PERSON-9] is yes.
EndUser: No, no, it's still yes, because we still we have D [PERSON-10], right?
EndUser: It's still
EndUser: This is just strengthening it. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, this is the thing to never.
EndUser: Okay. Got you.
EndUser: Then that makes perfect sense. They see anything else real.
Agent: Nope, I have everything we need. Alrighty. Cool. That's all we had.
EndUser: Thank you. Awesome.
Agent: Before you guys go, please be The second you close out of [ORG-3], all

008935_167_0LQ3y000009nyd8GAA,"EndUser: We're actually probably going to transition almost everything to salesforce, even like Enablement products and stuff like that.
Agent: Oh, really?
EndUser: We already use, what do you call it?
EndUser: I'm sorry if you hear it, [PERSON-1]. I got to take my cat
Agent: No, that's okay.
EndUser: [DATE-1]. I'm not a cat person by the name of my wife.
EndUser: So yeah, we already have all that stuff. Like right now we're using outreach, but we're gonna be moving to the Enablement product through [ORG-1] in the future.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: We're just trying to figure out some of the configurations. We did it before in the past, and it was like a pretty poor experience for our team.
Agent: Right.
Agent: Mm
EndUser: But I know that our [ORG-1] individual that runs this side of the house really wants to get everything on a single source, kind of like what you're mentioning.
Agent: Hmm.
EndUser: So.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: So what are you guys using then?
Agent: For [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Are you on sales force?
Agent: So they have that mistaken.
EndUser: Yeah, we're on [ORG-1] already.
Agent: Okay. Okay. You all are on sales force.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So you're just trying to...
EndUser: Yeah. And we use [ORG-1] for, I mean, we use it for cases, tracking everything. I mean, we're pretty extensively built into [ORG-1] and the admin, the guy that deals with our [ORG-1] stuff like their [ORG-2].
EndUser: But he's also the one that configured all the [ORG-1] too. So. But I know we've been going through looking at different products and different services. I actually went to day [DATE-2] and started heat.
EndUser: So yeah, we're pretty in the weeds with salesforce though.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Who should I, you know, I'm just trying to figure out then who would be the person to speak to on this if you guys, so it sounds like you're looking at our [ORG-3] or High Velocity Sales in lieu of outreach.
Agent: Does that kind of, does that ring a bell or sound familiar?
Agent: It's like what Outreach does Cadence, is that sort of thing?
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yep. Yeah, so do me a favor.
EndUser: What's your role with in [ORG-1]?
EndUser: Are you on the sales side of the house?
Agent: Yeah, I'm on the sales side of things. Mm hmm.
EndUser: Okay, Send me an email and I'll forward it over to his name is [PERSON-2].
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: He's our [ORG-1] admin individual and also the VP of IT.
EndUser: I'll chat with him and see kind of where we're at with this or if it's something where we're already in conversations with another rep. Do you know if we're speaking to someone else?
Agent: Yeah, I mean, the rep on the team that I see here is [PERSON-3]. I don't know if that's who you were working with before or that's the rep I'm currently seeing on your guys's account.
Agent: We just had our fiscal and in [DATE-3]. Things might have been shuffled and if you weren't talking to someone before, then it might, it could be a new person. It could be the same person.
Agent: It just, things kind of got a little shuffled. So.
EndUser: Okay, so is he no longer responsible for verify person?
Agent: Say that again. I'm sorry. Yeah. Very fine. First. Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: He's no longer responsible for the verified person account.
Agent: No, [PERSON-3] is. Yep. [PERSON-3]. [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Is that who you were working with?
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: So are you like an SDR then, a phone, et cetera, or?
Agent: Yeah. I mean, business development. That's right.
EndUser: Oh, okay.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Um, yeah.
Agent: But I work in tandem with him.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Um, Yeah, let me talk to [PERSON-5], but send me an email.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So my email is piecemullinatverifiedfirst.com.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Send me an email. I will forward it on to [PERSON-5].
EndUser: And then I'll just say, hey, [PERSON-5], do we have any progress on this or like, why don't we transition?
EndUser: I will say this, though, that I'm more of a fan of Outreach than I am the [ORG-1] tool, although I want every one of us.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: It's just I've seen the capabilities that you guys have.
Agent: No,
EndUser: And it doesn't seem like it's up to Outreach yet. I'm sure it'll get there at some point, but maybe there's a missing link that I hadn't seen on [ORG-4].
Agent: I'm
EndUser: But when we did it before, one of the issues we ran into was the email segmenting. We were getting to [ORG-5] left and right, or an outreach.
Agent: Just.
EndUser: We're not getting there all that often.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So that was some limitation. I mean, I would love, like, if you guys can help us too, like, so we use Zoom info for all the data and everything like that.
EndUser: You guys have anything besides Zoom info for data that you guys pull in.
Agent: No, I don't think. No, I mean, that's, I have that as well.
EndUser: And back in [DATE-4], they used to have, they said, okay, yeah, back in [DATE-4], they had data.com, which was a company sales source and bought and it was beautiful because the way the Integration function.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Was you could literally just pull the HR individuals that were targeting into like a cadence just right off of that as opposed to having to go to Outreach and then segmenting.
EndUser: I've heard that you guys do have an Integration with Zoom info.
EndUser: Do you guys work out of Zoom info or are you actually working out of just salesforce the entire time?
Agent: No, I work out a [ORG-1] and then I just have like a widget for Zoom info. So if I'm on like a website or something, I can pull up all their contact information.
Agent: And then [ORG-1] has a configured where, I mean, they're so, [ORG-1] is large and they're worried about security.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So we're not able to just click add a contact. We have to like put the name, phone number, and et cetera. But I believe that's just the thing we do.
Agent: And other companies are able to just Click a button and kind of add it in immediately, but yeah, I'm in sales force.
EndUser: Ok. Yeah.
Agent: Of the time, right?
Agent: And just popping over to the Zoom info to collect a contact here and there, depending on the account. Okay.
EndUser: Okay, yes, send me an email. I may have, [PERSON-6], I look, I know it's something that we're eventually going to do. I could just be real with you on that.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I've been in the meetings where we've been talking about it. It's just, we can't just overhaul one system right now and then jump into the sales force immediately.
EndUser: It has to be something where, you know, eventually we get there, but it has been a topic of discussion.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So if you want to let [PERSON-6] know it is, it is something that we are considering.
Agent: Awesome.
EndUser: It's just a timing thing and then also it will save us a little bit of money overall. But anyway,
Agent: Okay. Yeah. No, I'll get that email over to [PERSON-7] and, yeah, we'll go from there.
EndUser: But yes, thanks for coming to call and I know you got the, I've been in sales a long time, I was SDR, so [ORG-6], [ORG-7], whatever.
Agent: I appreciate you taking my call. Yep.
EndUser: And so I always appreciate calls and people call, especially if they do a good job.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, hopefully it wasn't too bad.
EndUser: So no, it was good. I would actually be interested in seeing the platform myself independently.
EndUser: And I could probably loop in the VP of sales myself and him with you to take a look and you guys can show the differences.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Because the problem that we run into is sometimes you have the IT team that's looking into one thing and then they're communicating with us and not letting us look at all the detailed information.
Agent: Great.
Agent: Great.
EndUser: And then they make a decision and it's not what's best for sales.
EndUser: And so sometimes It takes us taking a look at it and having multiple hats, taking a look at it as opposed to just, you know, the [ORG-1] guy would be like, yeah, let's just all do it in [ORG-1], and that's a great idea, but sometimes there's some missing links that we're missing, so.
Agent: Yeah, no, I agree. And I'm sure we'll absolutely be able to set a demo up with [PERSON-3] and go through that. No doubt.
EndUser: Okay, all right, cool. All right, man, hey, have [DATE-5], and yeah, shoot me the email. I'll check with [PERSON-5] [DATE-6] and see kind of what we're doing there and check with my VP.
EndUser: I know that at [DATE-7] meetings, so it might be kind of tough to nail them down [DATE-6], but definitely probably [DATE-8] should have some times and dates for maybe [DATE-9] that we could get them going.
Agent: Awesome sounds great.
EndUser: So, all right.
Agent: Look forward to it. Have a good weekend [PERSON-7]. Take care.

EndUser: This
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-1]. This is [PERSON-2] calling from [ORG-1].
Agent: How are you [DATE-1]?
EndUser: Is good.
EndUser: How are you?
Agent: Doing well. I was reaching out because we're gonna have some of our folks here from [ORG-1] at [ORG-2] forum coming up.
Agent: Is that something that you're gonna be attending or now?
EndUser: I will.
Agent: Oh, okay, awesome. Now very cool.
Agent: Have you by chance met [PERSON-3]?
Agent: He helps cover the state of [GPE-1] for [ORG-1].
EndUser: I don't recall if I have, you know, might have been in the setting right, but there was a whole lot of folks and I just don't recall for sure.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, no, totally understand that.
Agent: Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I would love to try to get you and [PERSON-4] and our team connected to kind of hear about some of the things that we're doing.
Agent: Across the country when it comes to child support services.
Agent: Is that something you'd be open to?
EndUser: I mean, I definitely will be looking to connect with folks there. I don't know what the schedule is going to be like, but I will be around and happy to introduce and meet up with folks.
Agent: Yeah, yeah.
EndUser: I can't say that I can guarantee a specific event or dinner or something like that, but happy to meet her.
Agent: Oh yeah, no, totally understand. Yeah, no, totally get it. Those conferences can be pretty hectic.
EndUser: It's a busy time in the, you know, just in the state and program as well.
Agent: What's.
EndUser: So I'm imagining, you know, could be some interruptions, but I hope we'll just be few.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, [PERSON-1], I don't know. I mean, we've got folks that'll be there. I'm not positive yet if [PERSON-4] will. We kind of have like our team of specialists for child support. on-site there.
Agent: But either before that or after that, I would love to just connect you with our [GPE-1] team to kind of talk about maybe some of the challenges that you foresee coming up [DATE-2] and we could kind of share how we've helped other agencies in similar capacities.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: Is that something you'd be open to?
EndUser: Yeah, essentially, I mean, I'm happy to keep my eye out for them while I'm there. And you're always welcome to send me anything.
EndUser: You know, if you think you have some, you know, I don't know if they're materials, you know, Marketing materials, reports, etc., that you want to share, that we might look a look at and have an idea.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: And if something seems like it's applicable to something we're working on, you know, we might reach out and find more.
Agent: Yeah. No.
Agent: And that's, that's really, I'm more of just an educational piece, just to connect you with our team to, you know, learn about what we do and kind of learn about your challenges and the kind of see if there's something there that we could help with.
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Agent: Or if there's a way for us to collaborate on something.
Agent: But as far as the event itself, if you want, if I could get your email address, I'll sync up with those folks to see kind of what their schedule looks like.
Agent: So maybe we can get you connected with them if we've got like a table there or something to keep your eye out on.
EndUser: Yeah, yep.
Agent: And then if you're interested in meeting with our [GPE-1] team, we can just coordinate like a virtual call [TIME-1] or something.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: If that's something you'd want to do as well.
EndUser: Sounds good.
Agent: Awesome.
EndUser: My email is just first letter of my first name is okay. And then for six letters of my last name, so C-L-A-Y-C-O. at dhs.state.ia.us.
Agent: Awesome. And then Cottage's.
EndUser: And I'm not sure I haven't looked that closely at the app for [DATE-2], but sometimes they're able to connect. I think there's kind of contacts and who's attending on the app as well.
EndUser: So they might be able to sign me there too.
Agent: Oh, OK, cool. They've got like a whole app for the event.
EndUser: I yeah. I don't recall if there's a way to connect, but it's possible that like my emails on there too.
EndUser: So if they're just looking for who's there, but I'm not [PERCENT-1] sure on that, I think it might have been that way [DATE-3].
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: I
Agent: Yeah. And then just to kind of get some insight from you, what are kind of like the hot button topics for you all. Right now, would you say. Right.
EndUser: Mean, [DATE-2] we're just going through an agency alignment. and a new name change for the program. So we're doing a lot of rebranding and that kind of thing.
EndUser: And a lot of shifting going on within the agency because of that alignment that's still going on.
EndUser: Or, you know, hopefully short-term looking toward a system or partial system modernization with like great platforming, but that's, It's not immediate yet, but we're, we've been taken some initial steps.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Those are the ones that we talked about that are the biggest probably right now.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: But lots of things going on.
Agent: Right. Yeah.
Agent: And to your point, you know, looking at potential system modernizations for us now is like the perfect time to have those conversations because there's not a timeline and we know how long sometimes that procurement process can take.
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Agent: So really for us, it's more like education going back and forth on, you know, what would you all be looking for?
Agent: What would you need?
Agent: Here's what we've done in the past. Here's how we could help. And then that way, when the time is right, it'll be able to, you know, click on all cylinders at that point.
Agent: Awesome. Well, [PERSON-1], and I've got my calendar up.
Agent: Would you be interested in maybe connecting with our [GPE-1] team, maybe sometime in [DATE-4]?
EndUser: Would you be willing to contact them and maybe just have them send, I'm guessing you probably have some, you know, summary or something that you have sent about the kind of things that y'all do.
EndUser: And I might be able to give them a little more specific idea of what I'd be interested in before we put a date out there. [DATE-4] is probably good.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That maybe gives enough time. But maybe later in [DATE-5] or something like that to have some time to think about what it is that might be, so that we might have the most interest in.
Agent: Right. Right. Now that makes sense. I can share a little bit about some of the things that we do. And we really do that is honestly one of the downsides about having these conversations.
Agent: [ORG-1] can really do so much.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: So trying to like pinpoint what exactly you need is really what is why we have these conversations.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: But one thing that I know has been pretty top of mind for like [ORG-3]. is like participants facing tools.
Agent: So like self-service websites where citizens or constituents patients can interact online, have a portal of some sorts to apply for benefits or get resources, different things like that.
Agent: One example I can give recently was within [GPE-2], [ORG-4] up there. They handle like business licenses. So folks who need a license to practice their business.
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Agent: Go through them to get those licenses.
Agent: So there's a portal set up where they can go online, apply, and then on the back end for the department, they have like a one-stop shop to basically see all those applications and see it from beginning to end all the way through.
Agent: You know, another example would be more on like the communications. piece of it.
Agent: So I know in [GPE-3], the [ORG-5] team over there does like targeted Outreach to folks who have like applied in the past for [ORG-5] of like automated messaging.
Agent: So kind of like [DATE-6] your renewals coming up [DATE-7]. You've got a schedule meeting coming up. Different things like that to kind of really help with the engagement piece.
Agent: So those are just a few examples kind of our capabilities.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: But yeah, we really try to cater it to you all. That's why we have these conversations.
EndUser: Okay. Okay. And. Maybe one thing I could do also before we set something up is, you know, go take a look out, you know, at your website, not kind of thing.

EndUser: I'll just take a quick peek so that if it looks more, you know, targeted towards me, I'll, you know, I won't use her time up, but I suspect there's a good chance I want to share with her.
Agent: Yeah. No, that sounds fantastic, [PERSON-1]. Well, I don't want to hold you up too much longer. I really appreciate your time and those great chatting with you. I will send that email over here shortly.

EndUser: Hello licensing, this is [PERSON-2].
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-2], this is [PERSON-3] with the [ORG-1] team that sports the state of [GPE-1].
Agent: Thanks for taking my, how are you?
EndUser: Hi.
EndUser: I'm good, how are you?
Agent: I'm doing well, thanks. I won't take up too much of your time. I'm actually just calling to reach out here to introduce myself real quick. I'm a new member of the team that sports the state of [GPE-1].
Agent: I saw that you are the chief of licensing with the register of contractors.
Agent: Wanted to see if you might have [TIME-1] to sync with our team on any priorities that might be top of mind for you [DATE-1], just to make some introductions and hear about what might be most important to you.
Agent: And if there's anything that [ORG-1] might be able to do to help with anything that's currently a priority at [GPE-2].
EndUser: That would be interesting. I would say that probably our IT person would be the person to reach out to really.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I would mind being in a meeting also, but he is our kind of point of contact regarding [ORG-1].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And his name is [PERSON-4].
Agent: How do you spell [PRODUCT-1]?
EndUser: That is J-A-C-O-V-I-N-O.
Agent: Okay, got it.
EndUser: I know we are currently having an issue, but we have had a math tech who is with our original designer for our Implementation of Salesforce working on that.
Agent: And
Agent: Yep. Okay. Got it.
Agent: And do you also work closely then with asset?
Agent: Is that?
EndUser: [PERSON-5] deals with assets. I do not.
Agent: Okay. Got it. Just because we were on a call. Yeah. with [PERSON-6]. I'm not sure if you know [PERSON-7] at DOA [TIME-2].
EndUser: I don't.
Agent: Okay, got it.
EndUser: I don't. [PERSON-5] might, but because he has, [PERSON-5] has actually demonstrated our version of [ORG-1] to other agencies because we've, you know, gotten many gains by using [ORG-1].
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay. I'm glad.
EndUser: I do. I will tell you. that I wish that [PERSON-8] was less pricey.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: So you're currently using [PERSON-8]?
EndUser: No, I am not, but I would like to be.
EndUser: But I was told that our IT team did look at that and found that it was too pricey for us, but I wish we could use it because I like data and I like to be able to organize my data.
Agent: Ah, okay.
Agent: Interesting.
Agent: Yeah, sure.
Agent: No, I mean, I think, you know, any agency [DATE-2] is, I mean, data is kind of fueling those decisions and, you know, to be able to have an analytics tool and to have the right visualizations to make.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Better sense of what the data is and take action on that.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: That's obviously really important. I'm just curious because.
EndUser: The big thing I'd rather, I would like to not have to export it in order to make, yeah.
Agent: Yeah. Okay, because yeah, that's that's definitely something that [PERSON-8] does is it integrates so that all of that data flow is automated.
EndUser: To use it. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So you're not having to manually export anything and it just can update in real-time automatically.
EndUser: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. And I had heard that I'd read some reviews on it just personally. Yeah, it's just, you know, for a state agency, you know, we have to watch our pennies.
Agent: Yeah, no, totally. Because we do work with a number of [GPE-1] agencies, [PERSON-8] specifically.
Agent: And it's actually, I'm not sure which version of [PERSON-8], whoever this person was, may have been talking about, because we have different versions of it, and the cloud version of it is actually quite cheap.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Mm hmm. Mm. Mm hmm.
Agent: I mean... a creator license, which gives you full access, all of the capabilities, full functionality of [PERSON-8], is [MONEY-1] a year.
Agent: I don't know how that fits into the budget, but where it gets where it does get a little price here is if there's if there are more [ORG-2] requirements where you have to have a physical server on prem on site.
Agent: And if you want to have Unlimited number of licenses and a limited number of public facing views of the data, if you're doing public facing dashboards, that's where it can get a little pricier.
Agent: That tends to get into potentially the low six figures range.
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: I'm just curious, what were you hoping to use [PERSON-8] for specifically?
EndUser: Yeah. Well, you know, if I can't get it. I'm not the one that holds the purse strings, but, you know, just personally for my department. We look at.
EndUser: Just the numbers of things that we get in and then the numbers of things we get in as opposed to [DATE-3].
Agent: Mm-hmm. Want to see that.
EndUser: So we'll do a historic look at data and then, you know, we do sometimes try to project out into the future as well.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: Or look at data.
Agent: Sure. No, let me.
EndUser: What's it called?
EndUser: Maybe a compound chart where you have, you know, this is a thing that influences applications and how did that look as compared to the number of applications that we got in, again, trying to just project what's happening, where the numbers are going.
Agent: Is it just you on the team who would be using [PERSON-8] or are there other members of the team that might be. needing to create the reports or viewing the report.
EndUser: Yeah, um, Yes. Well, so, you know, again, I'm not in charge of deciding on that.
Agent: Sure. Yeah, totally.
EndUser: But we do have a, I mean, he's a process improvement person, but he's basically got many hats. So he deals with our, our strategic plans and looking out into the future and looking at our past numbers.
EndUser: So we do have a person that does that, that's his main job.
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: So he would be the main person that this would be useful for.
EndUser: You know, I like the idea because I like looking at my data, but, you know, it would be mainly him and him using it to show to others either in the department or even outside of the department or the agency.
Agent: Okay. Sure.
Agent: Yeah, so if based on what you're describing, if he's the sole creator of the, we, you know, we call it the reports or the dashboards.
EndUser: Mm hmm.
Agent: And then let's say there's, I don't know, 10 people within the agency.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: I'm just making up a number.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: So we have two different license types for that. If we're using [FAC-1], it would be one creator license, which would be, like I said, $[MONEY-2] for [DATE-4].
Agent: Ten viewer licenses would, I think they're around like $[MONEY-3] a year. So not too much of a heavy lift, you know, relatively, all things considered.
Agent: If it's a relatively small number of internal users that we're talking about, I guess, The only way it would potentially get particularly prices, like I said, if there's like some heightened Security requirements where we have to have a physical server in place.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: And then it's, you know, public facing dashboards where the data has to be highly secure and people can't manipulate it.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Sure, sure. Right.
Agent: Things of things of that nature. Would I know, I totally hear what you're saying. I know you're not the decision maker and. It doesn't sound like there's a budget in place for anything like this right now.
Agent: Would you be interested in at least connecting with the [PERSON-8] part of our team?
Agent: I'm not that person specifically.
Agent: I'm not, you know, on the technical side of things and more in like a liaison type of a role where I connect, you know, the product experts on our team with customers, with the agencies that we work with.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: Would you have an interest in just like a quick [TIME-3] intro call with the [PERSON-8] team and you could invite anyone from your team just to... learn a little bit more about the use case that you're talking about and see if it might make sense.
Agent: Because then ultimately we'd be able to take that conversation to whoever might be the decision-maker ultimately, you know, thinking a little bit further into the future.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: And just say, you know, we've spoken with different parts of your team and, you know, there's a need here, there's a need there.
EndUser: Sure. Mm-hmm.
Agent: These are kind of some of the things where they could benefit from using [PERSON-8]. It usually helps us make a more compelling case. to whoever the decision maker is ultimately.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: And it also just, I mean, it helps us learn about what your needs are and how we would actually deliver value for your specific use case.
EndUser: Sure.
EndUser: So, yeah, could I get you to send me an email?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: Because what I can do is if you'll Send me an email just regarding, you know, you know, if we have any needs or if... [PERSON-8] was of an interest, then I could loop in the process improvement person and [PERSON-5].
EndUser: And then, you know, if it's totally outside of, you know, our box, then he can either let me know or he can let you know.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It's something that we can, you know, at least talk about, then we can set something up.
Agent: Yeah, that totally works for me. And, you know, happy to be a resource in whatever way I can.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Thank you. You know, like I said, we're working with, we are, we work with most of the agencies in the state at this point in some capacity.
EndUser: Uh-huh.
Agent: And [PERSON-8] specifically, you know, obviously we're, we're interested in helping people make sense of the data that they have. And if you're already using [ORG-1], you've probably got plenty of data somewhere in there.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: So it's helpful to have these tools.
EndUser: Yes. Yes.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I'll send you an email.
EndUser: Let me give you.
Agent: What's the best?
Agent: Yeah, what's the best one for you?
EndUser: Yeah. It's [PERSON-9]-I-E.Pickerill.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: P-i-c-k-e-r-i-l-l at ROC.AZ.gov.

Agent: Hi.
EndUser: Sorry. Just Mr. Call.
Agent: Yeah, no worries. Give me a ring back.
EndUser: Driving in hit a weird pocket.
Agent: Gotcha. And no worries.
Agent: How can I help you?
EndUser: Yeah, thanks for coming back. So I was calling because I know that in our ages, doing a couple of a couple of divisions that use [ORG-1], my division is emergency communications.
EndUser: So I work with the my team work with the first responders firing. Police self supported me needs they might need if you know.
Agent: And
EndUser: During [DATE-1] storm, just one of their communications repeaters good that we help get another peer up or we'd help them find solutions. So we have a team that does that.
EndUser: So we're looking for right now in order to be able to. Post like documents and just forums and like wiki pages, that kind of thing. We're using groups [ORG-2].
EndUser: And I would like to look at potentially a solution that's a little bit more just getting secure.
Agent: But yes the okay it whether whatever
EndUser: We do have people that are outside of our agency that would need to be able to access it as well.
EndUser: But I personally use [ORG-1], right?
EndUser: I like it for I like the layout and the use of it. I think I'm just familiar with it. But I didn't know if you had anything that like that you get forward.
EndUser: I was working like a white paper or just some kind of like a demo video of like what kind of group features are available.
EndUser: So I can kind of go over that and we'll be sure with my boss the ability to maybe use that instead of groups I owe for the things that we're going to be doing going forward.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. No, I can definitely dig up some resources there. What are the, you know, give me a lot of good information here.
Agent: What would you say are the top priorities that you're looking for?
Agent: I know I heard you say external access will be part of it, hosting documents, forums, wiki, and really, I guess, just providing communication to first responders and helping them find solutions. Yeah.
Agent: Related to emergency communications, is that kind of the gist of it?
EndUser: Yeah, so that's our function is that very last piece. helping to provide resources. But the people that will be using this resource is really a team of both staff and unpaid volunteers.
EndUser: If something comes up, there's just different like protocols and processes or directories, that kind of thing we wanna share in terms of, well, there's two different things.
EndUser: Some of them are documents like directories or being able to come up and other things might be, like just some of the things like wikis, but it would just maybe just be hosting.
Agent: Okay. Awesome, [PERSON-3].
EndUser: Like PDFs that is a how to access this particular secure building or whatever that kind of thing.
Agent: Okay. additional guidance on the TRC Yeah I don't know.
EndUser: So it will be mostly being able to share information with both staff and volunteers and any actual agencies from my agency with this [ORG-3] OES.
EndUser: So what do I mean by that?
EndUser: Everybody is coming from different email domains.
Agent: Understood.
Agent: And how many people would be accessing the system on your end internally?

Agent: Okay, got it. All right. And let's see. Is there a particular timeline that you're looking to implement this by.
EndUser: Um, we'd like to be able to do it as soon as possible, like, because we have a program that's coming up in [DATE-2] that we're trying to get some of our partners to sign up with.
EndUser: And right now we're asking to use [ORG-4] groups. I know, but I would like to not have to tell them to do that and then switch them.
EndUser: However, the reality is once I gather this information, it's all a day as I know you're going out, you're going to be out of the office as well.

Agent: Got it.

EndUser: So they're currently using it and I've reached, it does a long way for me. They, I've retested them to find out kind of what their current pay structure is.
EndUser: So I get some kind of ideas so I can let my bosses know, like, I know that fire and pain.
EndUser: It's not necessarily what we'll pay, but just so I can get a sense because I don't know what the cost will mean before I because we don't really have a budget. It's something that's really a chance.
EndUser: So we really have a budget wide item for it. Thanks for watching.
Agent: I guess in terms of like, yeah, in terms of price and budget, like there are different tiers of the [ORG-1] platform.
Agent: So it varies from very secure, which we're selling to the federal government, like to the actual [ORG-5], they're a big [ORG-1] customer.
Agent: To, you know, I guess, the more, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is there any increase like data [ORG-6] or data governance around what would be shared on the [ORG-1] platform?
Agent: Or is I guess the more entry level standard level of [ORG-1] you think would be adequate?
EndUser: Yeah, I think the entry level faculty adequately looking more at like, the tree isn't a huge issue for us in terms of, of course, it is, but not to the level that like maybe like maybe communications would in like position day, that kind of thing.
Agent: I'm just
EndUser: Uh, more of the function of being able to do those things that I mentioned to you, it's pretty important for us to be able to share that information and avoid it.
EndUser: You know, again, people with different, uh, domain, can access those documents without, without being able to share them.
Agent: Going to
EndUser: So some little security, right?
EndUser: But nothing like we don't need, you know, an [ORG-7] encryption or anything like that.
Agent: Drop in.
Agent: Got it. Okay, yeah, this one's good.
Agent: And I don't mean to imply that the entry level version of [ORG-1] is not to care, or to be so secure, it's just, I'm not very technical, but I know there are a bunch of additional features that can be, you know, the higher priced version.
Agent: So just wanted to get a sense of where that sells from different priorities for you.
EndUser: Of course, yeah, I understand. No worries.
Agent: So yeah, so I've got a lot of good information here that I can, I'll definitely go look for a good resource to share with you.
Agent: The next step on our end, especially if you do have a timeline of potentially mentally [DATE-2], would be just to schedule a quick [TIME-1] intro call with the [ORG-1] team.
Agent: That would just introduce you to the [ORG-1] account reps that supports [ORG-8] in the state of [GPE-1]. And then she would be the person who would be creating that budgetary quote and handling the whole procurement process.
Agent: So I know that's a couple steps away, obviously, in the future, but if it is something you're interested in, it would also be just an opportunity to ask her any questions.
Agent: And she'd be able to ask some questions that would be kind of more specific than I'm able to ask. I'm more in a support role here.
Agent: Would you have some time in [DATE-2]?
Agent: I know you're in the car right now, so I'm guessing scheduling might be difficult. while we're on the phone here.
Agent: Would you at least be open to a quick intro call with this lack rep?
Agent: Her name's [PERSON-4] at some point early in [DATE-4], first or second week of January.
EndUser: Yeah, that would be great.
Agent: Yeah, I think we're going to have that.
EndUser: We've got I've got a couple things going on in [DATE-5], and you should maybe that second week starting.
Agent: We've to go ahead. We'll seek this next.
EndUser: I can think that's the like somewhere around the eighth anytime after [DATE-2], and I can be pretty flexible. So with my time, so we can also try to schedule something.
EndUser: I think the only if I was in the city days with better kind of off the calendar for me really are [DATE-6] before [TIME-2].
EndUser: But everything else can be really exciting, but I just got a standing [DATE-7] before [LAW-1] can't move.
Agent: Okay, would [DATE-8] at [TIME-3] work?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I think that actually that got a word.
Agent: Okay, cool. I'll throw it on the calendar here. And what I'll do is I'll send you the calendar invite and a confirmation email with the [ORG-1] team [PRODUCT-1]: And I'll kind of summarize the use case and I'm assuming they'll have the right white paper resource to share with you kind of more of your tips than I would.
Agent: But we can move on [DATE-8] at [TIME-4]. And yeah, we're looking forward to it.
EndUser: That sounds great. Me too. And I assume because you've got 852 number, we're talking about [LOC-1] time.

Agent: Yeah, exactly. Yes.
EndUser: Okay.

008688_167_0LQ3y000009ohVSGAY,"EndUser: I did done really do a lot for me.
Agent: Got to say so it doesn't really serve as you on the sales and marketing side at a whole.
EndUser: Add really at all.
Agent: Like where does it fall short in your opinion?
EndUser: No.
Agent: Like it doesn't it allow you to you
EndUser: Yeah, there's no like advertising marketing through it. And pretty much at all.
Agent: Know like do y'all use a different software for advertising and marketing?
EndUser: Um. We have an agent, and we work with somebody who does all of that for us, but our software doesn't do, like I said, don't do any of that for us.
EndUser: We have an outside company who does that for us.
Agent: Gotcha, do they generate a lot of leads for y'all or a lot of quality leads, I guess?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Gotcha.
Agent: And so is there a way that you all are able to measure, I guess, as far as the leads that are coming through and what's the name of that age in that system?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I honestly don't know the gentleman's business name. No, I just, his name's [PERSON-1]. I talk to an email with him all the time. And I'm sure it's on his email somewhere. I'm not sure, yeah.
Agent: Yeah, no worries, but do you know, I'm sorry, go ahead.
EndUser: What does, yeah, what his business name is. Now that you say that.
Agent: Yeah, no worries at all, man. Hey, I'm not here to pop quiz.
Agent: Let me ask you this, do you know, like, does that information that they generate so those leads, does that go into your system or is that a manual process where, you know, someone is assigned to, you know, Oh, no, I win.
EndUser: Yeah, when the leads come to me, I talk to the people and then I have to enter it into field edge. So no, it is not automated. I have to do all that on my own.
Agent: Gotcha. Hang on [TIME-1]. Let me, I'm just making notes here.
Agent: Like, would it be helpful to have that?
Agent: Like if it were automated to where you, when leads came in, you didn't necessarily have to, you know, enter information that you can call the leads.
Agent: You can, you know, have all of everything in one place and be able to, you know, kind of, validate like, okay, this is goodly, okay, this process was smooth. This form of marketing is working best.
Agent: You know, let's follow up on that.
EndUser: I don't know how that would work in our end, but it sounds like a good situation.
Agent: Understood. I mean, well, you know, hey, that's what we do here in [ORG-1], so that's cool.
Agent: And I guess on the service side, you said so the [ORG-2] software that you're using, like I know you said it doesn't really help on the sales marketing and service side, but what is like what's your solution?
Agent: What's not your solution?
Agent: But what are what is your solution for the service side?
EndUser: What do you mean by that?
Agent: Oh field.
EndUser: The service side.
Agent: I'm sorry. [ORG-2] is the service side. So field edge.
EndUser: Yeah, that's where all of our customers, we schedule everything.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Everything is in that, yes.
Agent: Gotcha. And so there's no other system that y'all are using for sales.
EndUser: No.
Agent: Gotcha, gotcha.
Agent: So it kinda, is it just you that it falls on or are there other sales consultants?
EndUser: It's pretty much just me, me and the owner and another gentleman is part time, but I'm the only really full time. Person yes.
Agent: Gotcha, interesting.
Agent: Yeah, so I know like with the solutions that [ORG-1] has, like we have ways to help to kind of bridge where you could have, Kind of a single view, we call it like a Customer313 view of sales, service, marketing all in one.
Agent: And we actually, since you said it's really just you, the owner, and another part-time guy, we actually do have a new solution that would be perfect, that houses the sales, the service, and marketing all in one place.
Agent: Just to make sure I have the correct point of contact, [PERSON-2] would be the person I want to talk to as the owner, correct?
EndUser: He is the owner, yes, sir.
Agent: Gotcha. And just making sure I have my names correct.
Agent: [PERSON-3], is that your VP of operations or are they no longer with?

Agent: Who would be the best point of contact for me to talk to?
Agent: Would that be?
Agent: [PERSON-5], would that be talking to [PERSON-4]?
Agent: Would that be talking to [PERSON-6]?
Agent: Like who should I be aiming towards?
EndUser: [PERSON-6] isn't here anymore. [PERSON-7] would, yeah, he would probably be the best person.
EndUser: And then myself, while I, depending on, yeah, depending on what you're going for, sales and marketing side myself, but the general overall customer information site probably [PERSON-7], yeah.
Agent: Okay. Okay. And then my last question for you before I let you go because I know I've probably taken up more time than necessary for you.
Agent: In terms of the field edge software that y'all are using from a service standpoint, do you have any issues with that?
Agent: I know you said it doesn't really help in terms of the sales marketing side, but in terms of the service side, are there anything about it that you don't like as far as the user interface, as far as the information that you're able to get and things of that nature?
EndUser: No, of course there's some issues and actually he's looking into switching to a different system. He's looking into service tighten.
Agent: Service Titan, gotcha.
EndUser: Yes. So I mean there's a few limitations on this. Like I said, he has been looking into that most of [DATE-1] and I mean I think he's very considering that very seriously.
Agent: Okay, yeah, because we hear customers considering service [ORG-3], they're definitely a competitor in the space of service.
Agent: But, you know, the benefit of the solution that I have in mind is that it wouldn't just be service, it would be sales, service, and marketing all in one solution.
Agent: So that way, you know, you're not having a piece milled together systems. The contact I have for [PERSON-7], I think, gets me to the main line.
Agent: Do you have a better?
EndUser: Email is the only way to get all of them.
Agent: Gotcha. Use that email as the best way to reach [PERSON-7].
EndUser: Yeah, yeah.
Agent: Gotcha. Let me ask you this. If I scheduled a meeting with you [DATE-2] and I just kind of ran through, you know, just to kind of show you what the software looks like.
Agent: Do you think that would be of value so that when I do talk to [PERSON-7], I can have someone that can see like, hey, this is what.
Agent: What's possible with what we're looking at?
EndUser: I'm not [DATE-2], no sir.
Agent: Not [DATE-2], when would be a good time, do you think?
EndUser: I, my daughter is getting married in [GPE-1] [DATE-2], so I'll be out of town as of, yeah, as of [DATE-3].
Agent: Congratulations, congratulations.
EndUser: That's why, that's why I say, not [DATE-2] wouldn't be a good time.
Agent: Gotcha, hey.
EndUser: It would be better if you would call me [DATE-4] after and maybe we can schedule something.
Agent: Okay. Okay, hang on [TIME-1]. Okay, perfect.
Agent: So what I'll do is I'll send you a follow-up email, you know, kind of covering what we discussed [DATE-5] and, you know, send you like a calendar invite for [DATE-6] so that we can kind of discuss.
Agent: I'll follow up with, or actually what I'll do is I'll send you a follow-up email with some information on what we discussed.
Agent: I'm going to send [PERSON-7] an email and reach out to him and try to see if I can. get in touch with him and kind of get on his radar.
Agent: But I'll follow up with you with a meeting time for [DATE-6] so that way we can kind of walk through what the solution looks like because I think it would be of value.
EndUser: Do not schedule a meeting time until we talk. Yeah, just schedule something, please, please.
Agent: Yeah, no, no, I'm not going to get. No, no, no. Yeah, no, I'm not going to schedule a meeting time at all.
EndUser: So yeah, like I said, when I get back [DATE-6], yeah, I just Call me back and I'll see what I can do.
Agent: Fair enough.
Agent: Ok. sound good to me. Hey, congrats again on your door to getting married. Like that is awesome.

Agent: We had a dot fusion deal that we did with you guys, but this was a little bit further back in [DATE-10].
Agent: So I just need to take a look at who that with the old A who that contact was at the time because it's not on our record right now, so I just need to double check that.
Agent: But I can let [PERSON-1] or I can shoot you over a message you see, but I can figure that out who that used to be.

008747_167_0LQ3y000009GMr0GAG,"Agent: I saw in my notes here, I was recently signed over to [PERSON-1] and I saw that [DATE-1] you guys had moved over to 3click CRM.
Agent: So call in the check and see how that transition had gone and see how things were going for you guys.
EndUser: I'm actually on the sales team. I'm not in management here.
Agent: Okay, gotcha, no worries, we'll still get your opinion on it. It's valuable for me to see what you guys' actual experiences.
EndUser: Sure. Well, um. On the ground level, I'm probably the one that uses it more than anyone else anyway, so my opinion probably matters a little more anyway, I guess.
Agent: I got you. Okay.
EndUser: I've been top salesman for [DATE-2] at the same company, so I've been using pretty quick, and before that I used [ORG-1] footsteps. And I'll tell you, [ORG-1] was terrible in its original form. [PERSON-2] was just not very...
EndUser: There's no key wording. It no longer linked to our website so that it could pull up our inventory. And so there's a lot of things that I had problems with. It was not efficient.
EndUser: Also, there was no drift campaign scheduling. There was a lot of systems that I would have assumed were commonplace. Like, by [PERSON-3], she's in [GPE-1].
EndUser: And they can send text and email campaigns that are just sent out at intervals to keep engaged with clients. then we don't have.
Agent: Yeah, that's pretty standard. I
EndUser: Yeah, we've never had that at [GPE-2], not in [DATE-3] I've worked here. Just not a function.
Agent: Am.
EndUser: Crms are just not that functional for whatever reason.
Agent: So three clicks doesn't have that for you guys either.
EndUser: Well, let's put it this way. No one has ever trained this audit. No one's ever shown the sending the systems and it does not appear to have, I can send out a single campaign. I can even schedule it.
EndUser: But I can't automatically set like text message campaigns. It does not text.
Agent: Okay. Gotcha.
EndUser: Yeah. I can't do repeating campaigns either for email.
Agent: Ok, so it doesn't have any like failed cadence functionality or anything like or it does, but it's all just manual.
EndUser: Right. Yeah, that's right. And also I have another gig. I'm actually a commercial consultant for solar sales.
Agent: Ok. Whoa.
EndUser: And we're very old school there, mostly because we're independent contractors. So if I want to [PRODUCT-1], I got to go get one myself.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So I'm actually on the lookout for one because I just started and I'd like to have something, but I don't know where to even start looking because, you know, in the boat industry, there was a couple I saw and went to the, I went to [ORG-2] in [GPE-3] [DATE-4], [NORP-1] dealer conference and [EVENT-1].
EndUser: They were highlighting new systems that did a lot of things where, For instance, the system would actually quote votes for us.
EndUser: You would actually be able to set a percentage of price that you wanted, and it would quote that price for us.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Interesting.
EndUser: And exactly, and it would write the work order and send it to our service text, and they could start prepping the boat.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Everything in our company right now is handwritten. All of our contracts were handwritten. It's just very old school. There was a software there that just did everything for you. So there's no clerical errors.
EndUser: There was no, oh, I did the math wrong. You can just set the percentage you want on the management side and all the team, no matter what we do, we can't go below that.
EndUser: So no, no matter what the pricing will be right.
Agent: Yep, somebody's not going to come in another rapid undercut you by [PERCENT-1]. And like you said, there's no like clerical errors or anything stuff getting lost.
EndUser: Right, because...
Agent: And so then you've got to follow up with the operation scenes, all that annoying stuff.
EndUser: Yep. Yep. Which is... I can't remember for the life of me which system that was. I wasn't actually looking for it a while back.
EndUser: I want to say it was [PERSON-4], because it was also tied to a storage system. And we're on it. Our biggest problem is we're using Bit still. We're not on a cloud-based server yet.
EndUser: And so because we're using hard servers and Bit is so old, it doesn't communicate with a lot of the modern CRMs in a way that's efficient.
EndUser: We actually almost switched to a new [PRODUCT-1] and in digital contracts, all that glory stuff. But we didn't get around to it. So it's because Bit was a problem.
Agent: Okay, got in just for clarification that was with you with the solar gig or is that with [PERSON-5].
EndUser: That was it when, even. Yep, that was a let me.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Me personally, because I'm an independent contractor, I'd like to get a [PRODUCT-1]. And again, I'm gonna start looking, but I don't know where to start for a single entity [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: In other words, just me, right?
EndUser: I can pop my lead and I can put things in there to remind myself of follow-ups, start getting some phone calls and things like that logged.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That way it's not just me pieces of paper and maybe like an [PRODUCT-2] spreadsheet. I want something more complex, but I don't know where I'm gonna go and not break the bank.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah. Well, I can tell you there's a lot of options in this field. As I'm sure, I mean, you've already named five home here and four of them are specific to your marine industry.
EndUser: Yeah. Okay.
Agent: There's a lot of options on there. So, that's what we do have stuff that goes from every site. So, I was just sure you do the [ORG-3] versus that stuff. All of our connections with large Enterprise customers.
Agent: Of our customer base is actually small businesses with less than 38 employees. So we do have solutions in that space for you in particular just for yourself, just information-wise.
Agent: But then on [GPE-4] side as well, do you happen to know, I guess, some of my data here, it says that [PERSON-6], the old sales manager, she's no longer with the company, who would be like the best point of contact for starting conversations on
EndUser: So actually, [PERSON-6] is with the company. I should say she's back with it. She took [DATE-5] to go down to [GPE-5] and work down there.
EndUser: She came back, so she's been here a grand total of [DATE-6], and she's back to our sales manager again.
Agent: Oh, awesome. Good deal. So she, I guess, would be that best point of contact then for anything like serum related stuff like that.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, she would. Hey, bud.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I'm picking up my kid from school. So here's... Yeah.
Agent: I'll give it. Well, hey, it's [DATE-7]. I'll let you go. I really appreciate the information here. I'll probably reach out to [ORG-4]Agent: Let her know see if there's anything we can do to get some meetings on the board for [DATE-8]. But like I said, have [DATE-9].
EndUser: Yeah, what I would do is we're actually, are you working [DATE-10]?
Agent: I appreciate the info.
Agent: I am not working [DATE-10], but I you know it goes I can be that's what sales right it's always is
EndUser: Yeah, so she'll be in, but we're closed [DATE-13], so don't call us on [DATE-12]. She won't answer.
EndUser: So call our main phone number and you know our main line, right?
Agent: Okay
Agent: Yep
EndUser: Yeah, as for [ORG-5], she's kind of the gatekeeper for that stuff because mostly she lives in a [PRODUCT-1] because she goes through and just basically checks, follows up, does her follow-ups, make sure that we're maintaining where the leads are coming from and all that so we can track sales data and flow.
EndUser: So she'd be the person to go through that kind of stuff.
Agent: Yep.
EndUser: I talked to her directly. I'd be a jacket button.
EndUser: And we have any homework we're bringing home?
EndUser: Okay. Sounds good. Well, work, but it was from like, like, probably like [DATE-13]. Okay. Sounds good. So yeah, I give her a call on [DATE-12]. If not, then we do work [DATE-10].
EndUser: So if you want to talk to him, [PERSON-7] can too.
Agent: Guys, because y'all also something in there reminded me to call around [DATE-12]. I, like I said, I really appreciate it, man.
EndUser: Yeah, and if you have any info you want to text over to me about your CRMs, a link to different things, I would love to go ahead and check out what you have for an independent contractor level.
Agent: Yeah, so let me see what I can find specific to single user use cases, and I'll text it over to you.

EndUser: But the data is the biggest challenge in our company.
EndUser: So if you can help us find a way to consolidate the data, I know there's an out-of-the-box sales force deduplication tool, or at least there was back in [DATE-5].
Agent: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Even suggesting that tool, hey, look, I know that you guys have some issues with duplicates and people coming in through lead forms in your website.
EndUser: How are you handling those duplicates as they come in?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Because our sales force administrator just got let go.
Agent: I did not know that.
EndUser: I don't know if you're aware of that. [PERSON-7], howard, [PERSON-8].
Agent: Oh wait, yes I do.
Agent: And [PERSON-9] is taking over, right?
EndUser: I don't know if [PERSON-10], who [PERSON-10] is. They don't, I mean, they don't tell us anything really at all.
Agent: Oh yeah.
EndUser: When it comes to that.
Agent: We worked closely with [PERSON-7] and we actually met the person that is taking over his role, but we did hear about [PERSON-7], which so unfortunate.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Yeah. I mean, hopefully that person knows more about [ORG-2] and deduplication. And I mean, I'm telling you, there is like major, like that's the one way you can help me in my job.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Seriously, I know [ORG-2] like the back of my hand, but data cleansing and data management is a huge problem in our company.
Agent: Okay, that's great.
Agent: Yeah, data hygiene is going to be the big problem.
EndUser: And we use [ORG-5] for [ORG-2]. Yeah.
EndUser: Will you see [PERSON-8] for [ORG-2], which is very clunky as well?
EndUser: But I think part of that is because the data.
Agent: Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you so much.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: Would you mind, I'm not sure, you know, I want this to be equally helpful.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I would love to first off put time on the calendar after [EVENT-1], because this is all super helpful information, and given you are also a junior salesperson administrator, it would be helpful to go into more detail about some of the questions.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: And we have a solutions engineer that can also get that feedback as well, and see, especially on the duplication standpoint, where we can help out better. If it's okay with you, we'd love to put time on the counter.
Agent: We have an [ORG-6] in everything with SAGE. But again, speaking with [ORG-7] may help us to like again speak with people like [PERSON-4] or I guess he's leaving. But other people hire up.
EndUser: Oh, he's leaving.
Agent: I mean, the lead student told me [DATE-6].
EndUser: I did not know he was leaving. I did not know he was leaving.
Agent: Yeah. Well, maybe we could have a chance to do that.
EndUser: Oh goodness.
Agent: Yeah, he just told me that, but I don't know, but he didn't say it private. But we'd love to put time on the calendar to discuss.
EndUser: Oh wow.
EndUser: So I don't know if I would be the right person to discuss that with. I think you would probably want to talk to you.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You're going to hear the same thing from every business development person. It's data clons. It's our data.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Our data is a big problem.
Agent: Yeah. Okay. Got it.
EndUser: So I think the person you're going to want to talk to is the person who's taking over [PERSON-7]'s position and just going to her and saying, hey, I've called a lot of your people that utilize [ORG-2] and the resounding thing.
Agent: Okay, yeah, we'll connect with them.
EndUser: You don't even have to call anybody else. I'm serious.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: If you don't call anybody else, you have all the data you need because you're probably here the same exact thing. Everyone on my team, like on the Enterprise team, is probably going to tell you the same exact thing.
EndUser: The data is <inaudible>.
Agent: Oh, got it.
EndUser: Help us clean up our data.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But if you go back to her and say, hey, the resounding thing that I'm hearing is the data cleansing, like there's a lot of, like what's your process for leads coming in?
EndUser: Because we are a great data company when it comes to our technology.
Agent: Yeah. Uh-huh.
EndUser: But when it comes to process and processes, we don't have good processes and our marketing team is new.
EndUser: And so they're trying to, they actually have a role out open right now and I was actually going to consider taking it, but it was just too much of a pay cut.
EndUser: It's to document our customers experience from front end all the way to the back end.
EndUser: Like, the moment they get something from us, what happens?
EndUser: They go into a lead form.
EndUser: What does happens to that lead?
EndUser: And I'm telling you, I look at leads [DATE-7] long, and I get the same ones. I get four leads in [DATE-8] for the same company because they did four different actions on our website.
EndUser: It should be updating those.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: The duplication in the front, all they have to do is do the parameters on sales force to say don't allow a duplicate to come in.
EndUser: And use some fuzzy logic, but I don't know if anybody knows how to do it.
Agent: Who's the one who took the who is now filling that role for the customer experience?
EndUser: Nobody. It's open now.
Agent: Nobody is still open. Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, it's still open. I just talked to somebody about it with the hiring manager, because it goes through our marketing team, the hiring manager of that group.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Go ahead.
EndUser: I can tell you who it is, because she told me that they were looking for, let's see what's happening.
Agent: Yeah, we've been talking to L on the marketing side.
EndUser: Yep, it's [PERSON-9]. Yep, [PERSON-9]'s a hiring manager.
Agent: So yeah.
EndUser: She's new.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: She's only four or five months in.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So,
Agent: Yeah, we've met with L, but I'll definitely bring that up and see.
EndUser: She would be, she's the one that told me we were looking for a deduplication tool.
Agent: Okay,
Agent: That's helpful. Thank you. Okay, great. Well, I will circle back with our team and make sure the feedback gets to the people that we're speaking with, especially in your admin.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: It's good to get this feedback. So I appreciate you taking the time to connect with me, especially talking about holidays.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Oh, not a problem. And I'm not a junior admin at [ORG-8]. I was at our previous company. I actually went to [ORG-2] training.
Agent: Yes, yes.
EndUser: So I know a lot about [ORG-2].
Agent: Oh, no way.
EndUser: People usually come to me and ask me questions about [ORG-2] and running reports and CPU and stuff.
Agent: Ok. Well, that's awesome.
EndUser: No.
Agent: Oh, great. You're probably better at salesperson than I am.
EndUser: I don't know about that. I just figure my way around it.
Agent: I'm glad to hear at least besides the, seems like besides the data hygiene which from seeking other people, that's the biggest point. Seems to be going pretty well, but [ORG-5] feedback and the data duplication.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah, other than that, it's really, I mean [ORG-2] is pretty easy to use. I mean, it's a user friendly, intuitive. You just have to know the cross-field.
EndUser: Like what cross objects you can't do reports on to make sure you grab the right data, but other than that.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. And we'll connect with someone on [PERSON-11] team too about that. I know I just sent an email to [PERSON-6] and I spoke with [PERSON-11] for a little bit so we'll definitely try and we're figuring that out.
EndUser: Well, that's sad to hear that he is leaving snow.
Agent: Oh yeah, maybe you don't tell me on that. You didn't say it was private but maybe you don't say anything there. Oh yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I won't say anything to anyone, but I'm pretty good with talking with him. I actually was gonna work for him at one point and decided to stay put.
EndUser: So I'm glad I made the right decision because it would have definitely been different.
Agent: Yeah. Well, he did tell me that but who knows but well thank you so much again for taking the time and hope you have a great great holiday.
EndUser: Yeah. All right. Not a problem.
Agent: Bye.
EndUser: All right. Thank you. You too. Bye.",Did the conversation flow smoothly? Did the salesperson establish good rapport with the buyer and build trust?,"The conversation did not flow smoothly.

013548_167_0LQ3y000008rZDrGAM,"Agent: I'm colored from [ORG-1].
Agent: How you doing?
EndUser: [PERSON-1], pretty good, how are you?
Agent: I'm doing quite well.
Agent: Can you hear me?
Agent: Okay, I've been having weird connection issues [DATE-1].
EndUser: Yep, I got you.
Agent: Good to see you. Well, yeah, I just talked to my buddy, [PERSON-2], who said you're kind of looking for a new [ORG-1] instance. The [GPE-1] connection has been working super well.
Agent: And so it seems like he has just a brief amount of time. Wanted to confirm you still have [TIME-1].
EndUser: Yeah, thanks for asking. Definitely willing to chat.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And give you some contacts, some contacts is needed.
EndUser: But yeah, we, long story short, we're a startup kind of, right?
EndUser: We're a global company, but we're getting our start in the [GPE-2], just in [DATE-2] and [DATE-3], actually. So I came on [DATE-4].
EndUser: We were building excavators for [PERSON-3], which is where I came from.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: For [DATE-5]. So we're kind of on our own destiny now. In one place is, you know, [PERSON-4] and I, for sure, one place we're really lacking is in the system side of things.
EndUser: And processes, typically, but that's kind of not necessarily your wheelhouse, but I think I'm our director of national accounts and I'm onboarding to the people right now. They will be calling on customers directly.
EndUser: They'll do some direct sales with them, but they'll do a lot of them through dealers as well.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So yes, I guess it sounds like we have several accounts with you guys, so I guess that might complicate this. But in the end, I'm looking for a solution, a [PRODUCT-1] solution for my team.
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: And would like to get it. up and running fairly quickly. If I do anything through corporate, it's going to be forever.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And they're looking at [ORG-2]. I know that they were looking at you guys pretty strongly as well, but the director that was leading that whole charge just got let go.
EndUser: So I talked to my boss, and he kind of said, hey, you know, get some costs and try to run with something on your own and see if we can get it done.
Agent: Oh, okay.
EndUser: So that's where we are.
Agent: You'll have one. No, I appreciate that contact. And yeah, I have. Let's see.
Agent: So what I want to do, and I think we can definitely help you out here, wanted to get a calendar invite to you with an introduction to our account team.
Agent: We have a couple folks still out of town for [DATE-6], but I know [DATE-7] everyone should be around.
Agent: During that call, we'd love to just learn a little bit more about, I mean, basically, I'll get, I'll brief someone what you just told me about wanted to hear some good contacts and they'll have some better, I guess, discovery questions more about what exactly you're looking for.
Agent: And they can also share a little bit more on, you know, the complexity as it pertains to all of [ORG-3]'s existing accounts and whatnot.
Agent: But wanted to see what your [DATE-8] looks like [DATE-7] for maybe a [TIME-2] intro and we can kind of get the ball rolling on and see what we can do here.
EndUser: Sure, looks pretty good. I'm traveling, but I'll have free time.

Agent: What about choose or what times then are you in actually?

EndUser: Otherwise, I'm on mountain time, usually.
Agent: Good. [DATE-9].
EndUser: Some [GPE-3] based, but I'll be in [GPE-4] [DATE-7].
Agent: Okay. Let's see. Okay.
EndUser: So yeah, I mean, [DATE-7] [DATE-10] would be best [DATE-10] [TIME-3]. Um, or the following comment in town and [GPE-3] [DATE-10]. So either one would be fine.

Agent: Right?
Agent: Yeah.

Agent: All right, so let's see.
Agent: And, um, so your [ORG-3] construction machinery, right?

EndUser: But we're [LOC-2]. So [ORG-4], go ahead.
Agent: How was sorry, God.
EndUser: Hcm is a Dr. Good Trust machinery in [GPE-1]. So they're the kind of parent. And then we're one of their [WORK_OF_ART-1], one of their business units.
EndUser: Worldwide, so there's [GPE-1], there's [GPE-5], there's [GPE-6], there's [LOC-3], there's, and then us, we're the [LOC-2], we cover [GPE-2], [GPE-7], and [LOC-4].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So,
Agent: Okay.
Agent: How is that related to [PERSON-5]?

Agent: It's [PRODUCT-2] at [DATE-10].
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Beautiful. Sending that over to you now. Let me know if you get that.
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: Happy.
EndUser: Okay. And I would say. So I
EndUser: Just signed up for the sorry, I signed up for the like the 36 day trial as well.
Agent: Here. Okay.
EndUser: I don't know what I signed up for though. I think I was under the sales section, but I just got the thanks for signing up for [ORG-1].
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: And it has a login and a username. So maybe I'll just give that a shot to you before we meet to check it out.
Agent: Yeah, I'll play real with that. And yeah, that basically, I presume it is the Sales Cloud side that you sign up for. And that'll kind of walk you through like day in the life of a user.
Agent: But what we can do during our first call, that might lead to a second call, where we do a little bit of a demo for you.
EndUser: Đđđđđđđđđđđđđąđđđđđđđđĉđ…
Agent: We'll show you kind of how the end user experience is interwoven with the administrator type role. just to kind of clear up any kind of kinks and whatnot.
Agent: So what you'd be doing on the trial is kind of what the end user would be doing. So yeah, player, I want that. Take some notes, see what you like, see what you dislike. So it's all pretty scalable.
Agent: So that's kind of why we like to do a bit of discovery into your case and do a little bit of scoping around your team and what the future might look like for [ORG-6].
Agent: And we can kind of play around with certain features that you like or dislike, etc. So.
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: But more to come.
EndUser: Cool.
Agent: We did you get that invite?
EndUser: Do you have just...
Agent: Just want to make sure sometimes people don't get them, and then everyone forgets about the call, and it's a whole mess.
EndUser: Yeah, I got it.
Agent: Cool. This is awesome.
EndUser: And then, do you have just another quick minute or you got a...
Agent: I know I'm good.
Agent: What's that?
EndUser: Cool. So, I want to make sure I'm wasting any one's time either.
EndUser: So, I just want to kind of give just a little bit of a little bit more context to kind of what we're looking to do and then looking to do and then...
EndUser: This would just be mainly for my group. I don't really need any other [ORG-3] people having access to it.
EndUser: Not that I want to like, you know, silo ourselves or anything like that, but I think we would like to own this. For sure specifically.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I don't know if it would be integrated with our other. Use I'm assuming no, but. I guess so right now it's me and it'd be two other people on board and two people.
EndUser: I want them to be able to just manage their accounts. So they'll be doing direct sales to customers. They'll be doing mostly deals through dealers and working on large bids and large RPs.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I just want them to be able to manage their account information and be able to go in there and be like, hey, I just met with this guy or gal. And here's what we've got.
EndUser: And the reference notes from your phone. You know, be able to have the phone app that you can use. Be able to update opportunities.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Quotes, upload files to those quotes, or upload files to the system style, and then some basic reporting.
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: A question I would have to, maybe we'll get into this on the call, is just the infrastructure side of it. I don't know how involved that is.
EndUser: Integrating our models and pricing and stuff like that. I'm assuming I can do that on my own but yep
Agent: I'm not the best person to answer that question.
EndUser: Yeah
Agent: And I think I really do appreciate the contact. I still, I think getting you chatting with [PERSON-7], he's our solutions engineer. He can kind of explain this simplicity.
Agent: And it sounds like you want basically just a very simple cloud for just, I mean, exactly what you just said, just your salespeople tracking leads, you know, uploading files and building quotes you want to ask.
EndUser: It.
Agent: There are ways to embed your data or integrate whatever data pools that you have, but I know [PERSON-8] can talk a little bit more to you on that.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: But everything you discuss is possible and I think it should be pretty simple.
Agent: You know, as far as like, if you have a large instance, of course, like admins are usually helpful to have or like a, you know, someone whose full-time job is to do sales courses required, but for a three-person team like...
Agent: I know plenty of companies that use a free person cloud and it's very feasible and something that can be pretty quickly implemented. So
EndUser: Cool. Yeah. So you're on the sales side, then I assume.
Agent: I am, yes.
EndUser: Okay, cool.
Agent: Well, yeah, you're good.
EndUser: So I think, go ahead.
Agent: Actually, I work on [ORG-7], which is sales service and marketing, but I'm on a sales team for the [ORG-7] product or the [ORG-7] suite of products.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Okay. Cool. And I think, I mean, it'll be a group of three two start, but it'll probably grow pretty quickly. So I think, you know, as long as it's going to be scalable a little bit too.
EndUser: So, last thing.
Agent: Absolutely. Thanks, [PERSON-9].
EndUser: I'm assuming we can get into cost a little bit on that too because I mean I'll be straight up.
EndUser: If we're going to be exploring as a company, another platform, whether it be, I think they're looking pretty hard of a spot just to be honest with you or they were when this guy left.
EndUser: I don't know where that's going to go, but I was advocating for you guys to begin with. So anyway, doing my own thing is the point and spending.
EndUser: If I'm, if I'm, if I'm said, yeah, if I said [QUANTITY-1] of money, like, I'm going to be like, from this platform for us and then they're spending money on something else, let's just say, worst case scenario.
EndUser: I'm going to be looking to minimize the cost of this as much as possible.
EndUser: So I guess a basic thing like you said, and I don't know if they're a, well, I'm assuming we'll probably get into this on the call or after, but interested in what that kind of looks like, even if it's a ballpark, because again, I don't want to waste your guys time.
EndUser: If it's like 28,
EndUser: Granted, some type of that, that's just completely out of the question. So I just wanted to establish that up front.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Got you. And to be honest, I don't know a whole lot about pricing. So yeah, we'll address that on the first call.
Agent: You know, learning about the scope of what you guys are looking for will definitely be important to that, but it seems like you want something pretty simple. So hopefully we can minimize that for you guys.
Agent: Build something nice for that. And a lot of startup branches that I've seen that have kind of embarked on these endeavors, have found that their team is sort of a trial, and everyone starts to notice.
Agent: And everyone's like, wait, I want to do that. Not that you guys want to integrate with other instances or other divisions, but you guys might be a little bit of a guinea pig.
Agent: In this greater sales force endeavor versus HubSpot. So we'll play around with numbers during the call.
EndUser: No problem.

Agent: Hi, this is [PERSON-2] calling from [GPE-1]. I'm calling from parliamentary services [ORG-1].
Agent: What was your name?
Speaker 2: Is [PERSON-3]?
Agent: [PERSON-4].
Speaker 2: [PERSON-4], yeah, D-C-E-C-L-A-N.
Agent: Yeah, I'm [PERSON-5]. Oh, [PERSON-4]. Okay, great. Good [NORP-1] name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it. I think I'm the quarter [NORP-1].
Agent: All right.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Agent: Great.
Speaker 2: Did you call the number [DATE-1] [PERSON-6]?
Agent: I did. Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought so, just because we had a miss call come through. When I tried to call it back, it just basically didn't connect or didn't ring through. So apologies if you have already tried to contact us.
Agent: All right. Well, good. I'm so glad to reach you now.
Agent: Do you have a minute?
Agent: No.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: How can I help?
Agent: We are, are you in [GPE-2] right now?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm based in [GPE-3] in [GPE-4], but I work in the public sector team covering the whole of A&D.
Agent: Okay. Okay, good.
Speaker 2: Did you say you were calling from a department in [GPE-1]?
Agent: Yes, I'm falling from [GPE-1] and I'm with [ORG-2].
Speaker 2: Just right now one more little bit sitting next time maybe alongside the story.
Agent: We're a smaller party and we We've just won election back into the government. We formed a government, [ORG-1] has formed a government with national, [ORG-3] and [ORG-4].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Agent: And both [ORG-4] and New Zealand First Parties are smaller parties. And [GPE-5] has been out of government for a while, for [DATE-2] actually.
Agent: And We're very happy to be back in government and back in parliament. We have eight MPs.
Agent: And we've been using, while we were in the wilderness, we created a new website using [ORG-5] with the subsequent database populated with [ORG-5].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Agent: We're hosted by them. So it's essentially a contact management database that allows us to do. donor management functions and merchant processing. And also we can do email, blast, and survey creation and so forth.
Agent: So it was really good for outbound marketing and getting donations. So now we're in government and we have a budget from parliamentary services. that we can deploy towards a contact management, customer relationship management solution.
Agent: The challenge is we can't use any of that budget for donor activities, so we can't be raising money.
Speaker 2: Why is that [PERSON-5] just out of interest?
Agent: And we...
Agent: Wow, those are the rules.
Speaker 2: Right, okay
Agent: Oh, go. It was now, we hear that the rules got bended. Labor was in government for [DATE-3], and they had a bespoke system that they used and borrowed from [ORG-6].
Agent: So I think the rules might not be the same in [GPE-6], and then [ORG-7] may have done just them a little bit because there's functionality there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Agent: So anyway, we won't get into that. But if we follow the rules, we are not supposed to do donor management functions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no problem at all. So listen, we can definitely help [PERCENT-1]. You know, this is our bread and butter. Can I just ask where, you know, you've heard of sales force or way kind of came across it.
Agent: Okay, so [PERSON-4], back in [DATE-4]. I worked at [ORG-8], which in the state, which was a venture funded [PRODUCT-1] marketing services provider.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Agent: And we were venture funded by [PERSON-7] and [PERSON-8] of her ventures. And those two venture funds also funded [ORG-9]. I was in sales.
Agent: And our venture capital partners said, well, we're funding [ORG-9], so you should use them in your company. So I get used to very early vision of [ORG-9].
Agent: I don't know, made in [DATE-5] by the time the thing was configured. So that's how I know of [ORG-9]. So it's, you know, and I used to, yeah, and I used to sell customer relationship management system.
Speaker 2: That's amazing.
Agent: So I used to sell, I worked for [ORG-10] firm, and I sold systems to [ORG-10]. and [ORG-9] and [PERSON-9] and [ORG-9]. So I know the customer relationship management space really well.
Agent: And so then when I looked at [ORG-9], I was amazed at all the modules. And the challenge is, because I've been in sales and marketing my career, and now all of a sudden I'm helping the political party.
Agent: There's an element to this that is what's called correspondence management because we've been outbound, you know, during the campaign it's all Outreach and outbound marketing. But now we have to kind of put on an inbound fact.
Agent: We have to hear, we're going to hear now, from constituents who have policy queries or policy opinions and we want to be able to poll, take sentiment polls. So there's an inbound element to this.
Agent: That are trying to get my head around, which I saw in [ORG-9], you have like a correspondence [PRODUCT-1] module, correspondence management, which I think is really interesting.
Agent: So anyway, we still have to do an outbound function, outbound email marketing. There's a person tasked with that on our communications team, and there's a person tasked stakeholder management and community engagement.
Agent: And then I'm tasked with incoming handling the incoming. We have three ministers and eight MPs and routing that and also testing sentiment and kind of getting a sense of how our policies are landing.
Agent: So that's it and that's all.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, amazing. Well, yeah, can definitely help. I don't know if you're aware, but yeah, so I mentioned, really, I work in the police sector team.
Speaker 2: So the instance of [ORG-9] that you probably use and what [ORG-9] have traditionally been best known for [PERSON-5] is that kind of commercial sales customer service.
Speaker 2: Now the team I work in is basically harnessing that technology and tailoring it to specific use cases in government.
Agent: Yep.
Speaker 2: And we've now been doing that for [DATE-6].
Speaker 2: So regardless of what you need, whether it's in-bounds, stakeholder engagement, marketing, outbound components, I can pretty much guarantee that it would literally be an off-the-shelf product that you guys could select or select a few products.
Speaker 2: To get up and running with what you need.
Speaker 2: So more all I need to do is just to connect you with the right person that looks after your account in [GPE-1] and then what they will do is set up a meeting, [PERSON-5] and where you probably know how it works if you sell the software yourself and then go from there.
Agent: Yes.
Speaker 2: So let me just try and find your organisation. So just remind me the full name of the department that you work for.
Agent: Well, it's [ORG-1]. And it's [ORG-1]. I mean, we're in the government, along with national and act. And the budget area is parliamentary services. So every party.
Agent: Will have budgeting budget for parliamentary services staff. And then there is ministerial staff. So the budget area is parliamentary services staff.
Speaker 2: Right, so [ORG-13] research.
Agent: But I don't know if you look us up. We'd be [GPE-1] first.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it is the amazing Trangly that we'll look at for you guys. So, Trang works with my team, she's actually based in [GPE-7], but she spends a lot of time over in [GPE-1], [GPE-8]
Speaker 2: So, she's actually just recently got back from the recent [PERSON-10] conference that you guys had over there.
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, what I would do is I'll send to these notes, so obviously you don't have to repeat yourself. And I'll just get trained to getting touch and organise a meeting for you with the account specialist.
Speaker 2: And you can take things from there.
Agent: That would be great. Our challenge is that we really need to try to make this happen [DATE-7]. Really, there's three of us. We had a demo [DATE-8], and we're trying to set up a demo [DATE-9].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Agent: It was [TIME-2], you know, [ORG-14] meeting, [ORG-14] thing. So if it's possible to get like a preliminary one of those, some time [DATE-9] or [DATE-10], that would be great.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. We can move quick. We can move quick.
Speaker 2: Who did you have a demo from just out of interest?
Agent: Oh, I want to say it was QAnon, but it's not. It's like Q-O-M-O-N, [ORG-22].
Speaker 2: Oh, come on. Yeah, yeah, okay, cool. Awesome. Well, listen, yeah, we can move quick. So I will literally call Trang now. I'll get to again to set that meeting up.
Speaker 2: And then hopefully, yeah, listen, I'm short and squeeze that in before closing business [DATE-7], but [GPE-9] will know time scales and availability, [PERSON-5]. So,
Agent: Okay, what's your email?
Agent: Yep.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm a D. Millington. So, [PERSON-10], I-N-G-T-O-N, at [ORG-14].
Agent: Okay. Demailington-at-tailforce.com. So I'll send you a quick email with my contact info. I don't have a government domain name yet. I'm still using an [ORG-14] first.nz domain. But then you'll have all my contact details.
Speaker 2: Amazing, Harriet, that's brilliant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I'll keep an eye on that coming through and then I'll connect you with trains straight away and let it work in magic and then yeah hopefully the team can come out and see you [DATE-7].
Agent: Okay, great.
Agent: And how do I spell train?
Speaker 2: So, [PERSON-9], so it's T-R-A-N-G and then [ORG-22]. And yeah, and she's an absolute jet.
Agent: Yep, okay.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's definitely the best person speaks about the [GPE-1] market initially. So, yeah, you send me details and I'll call Trang in the meantime and let me know what's happening.
Agent: Awesome. Thanks so much, second. Take care. Bye.

013458_167_6qr3y000000ocblAAA,"Agent: They built this application like absolute garbage and they're like, why did you do that?
Agent: They're like, that's what the business asked for. It was like they were asking, it doesn't matter. But the business is asking for something stupid.
Agent: I'm like, well, did you push back on them?
Agent: They're like, no. So let's not make. let's not commit the same thing again.
Agent: Yeah, no, I'm I'm gonna rep, yeah, challenge us.
Speaker 4: Not in this. So I'm gonna,
Agent: I'll challenge what [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] are saying as well, but certainly we're gonna listen to, you know, the things that make sense. So they're good with the system APIs.
Agent: They've actually said they wanted more process APIs given how the systems are calculated. That's fine.
Agent: And we reduced the experience APIs down to two, although [PERSON-2] are you saying we might not need any, but depending on how much if we wanna play, you know, if this is reasonable.
Agent: That's a total of 28 PIs, and we're going to say that 13 of them are small and you think possibly half of the process ones will be immediate . Yeah, OK, that's perfect.
EndUser: I think so, yeah. Yeah, we can, you know what, just for the aircraft, keep the experience API as six just in case, like you never know, we can cut it down on the uncertainty, make
Agent: It as a. And we'll assume that they're small just to, just in case, so that's actually just builds it a little bit a little bit.
EndUser: Right,
Agent: Ok, so if that's the case, then for Sootenia, we have
Speaker 4: A very cool, small.
Agent: I'm sorry.
Speaker 4: Oh, 13 plus six is [DATE-1].
Agent: Well, [DATE-2], six and six, right?
Speaker 4: Oh, oh, let me hear the phrase. Sorry.
Agent: Right, right. 13. So yeah, I know this is something. So there's a total of 28. system, six process, six experiences. We said 28 of the 28 would be small.
Agent: We allowed for possibly three of the process APIs to go up to medium. So this 13 and 3 is 13.
Speaker 4: Yep,
Agent: And the 15, six and six is also 18, so that lines up. So we have 17 small and three medium. If we go over here and we put in small. small and three medium.
Agent: It comes out to a four by four, which I think is what we had before.
Agent: And this is where you can see also with the mediums, how the pre-production we assume fewer cores, because for the mediums in production, you need to have all the core capability.
Agent: But in your test environment, if you just do any functional testing, you don't need the redundancy, you don't need the, you know, whatever, the same core capability, because you're not testing it unless you really want to test it a full load.
Agent: So you'll see that we actually do some.
Agent: The number of [DATE-3] that are needed when you start seeing mediu m larges and extra larges because you don't need all that CPU to do you r functional testing in the test environment the way you need to prolong it So anyway that comes out to be a [PRODUCT-1] lucky
Agent: For us . I think that goes back to the superintendent was it was four by four. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you're Let's go through this.
Agent: Making me okay.
Agent: Because the thing is there's rounding across all these projects. Yeah. And so by consolidating all of them, but you know what I mean.
Speaker 4: Not consolidating,
Agent: We would they would benefit from of running all those cores together. Right, we can put these, we're doing these individually numbers.
Agent: To kind of get subsystem
Agent: If you want, we can put these, which is the sum of all this together
Speaker 4: Just to see how that compares. Yeah, yeah. Whether or not there's a lot of rounding whatever, right, that's [PERSON-3].
Agent: Error or going there. Yeah, I did notice a rounding,
Speaker 4: Thanks for calling out. Yeah, yeah. I'm just going to, just for the sake, I'm going should start at number good point of trial, your are minor just a division of that.
Agent: To go up now. We'll look at [GPE-1]. We one first because
Speaker 4: Yeah. Yeah. So I can tell you. So if you look.
Speaker 4: So the process API is I'm sorry, the experience API number is definitely too high because most of those lines are data feeds and not applications that display information themselves.
Agent: Set them in half or even further.
Speaker 4: Where is it now?
Agent: Instead of 13 systems, half of them would require it in 10. You're sounding like maybe that's even smaller.
Speaker 4: Projects, so I mean the core, our core objects, our core applications is homepage, projects, orgs, people. I'm actually gonna get a time card in there, which probably we should include that.
Speaker 4: Message bus, but that's kind of, at the busy thing that could be, you know, 10 might not be a bad number to shoot for, give us a little bit of growth, but like our core is somewhere in the five or six, I think.
EndUser: Right.
EndUser: And then like, this is for [DATE-4] only, right?
EndUser: Like are we parking even beyond that?
Agent: [PERSON-3], do you have any comments on that?
Agent: I assume that we were figuring what you would need.
Agent: Well, if we're doing the ELA thing, is that a one year or [DATE-5] kind of approach?
Agent: So [DATE-4] is certainly what we want to focus on. Yeah.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely [DATE-4]. I mean.
Agent: Well, let me show you this.
Speaker 4: We can
Agent: Put year over year growth in here to say, let's figure and then we can estimate how that would grow if you have say have [PERCENT-1] growth and then Um, this, this will make it 17.
Agent: Out what's going on before
Speaker 4: Easier
Agent: Then we'll be able to calculate whatever we come with [DATE-4] numbers using this it'll estimate what you need for [DATE-6]. Like, you know, if you have [PERCENT-1] growth the following, whatever.
Agent: No, no, this is by the way, guys, if you can't tell, I hate this.
Agent: Gee, this And do we have a hard, do we have a hard stop in [TIME-1]?
Agent: Tool. Yeah.
Agent: I do have to jump to a demo, yes.
Agent: Okay. Well, second.
Agent: Let's take a
Agent: So let's just get forward 22, see what we come up If that seems high because all of the capacity for this [DATE-7] thing, we're going to want to get that in [DATE-8].
Agent: With.
Agent: Right. So what we, I mean, one way we could do it is just do very similar to what [PERSON-4] just said, except this spreadsheet garbage and it's not going to be clear.
Agent: So we'll come up with 31 numbers in [DATE-9] in [TIME-2], and then [PERCENT-2]
EndUser: We can just add
Agent: [DATE-10] and see what that looks like. So that's not good. All right. So if we're good here, you're good with these numbers 28 and 10, a total of 34 APIs.
Agent: And this then would be probably 31 of them would be small and maybe five or different numbers. You know, how many of these do you think
EndUser: Would be medium like those process APIs might be mediums?
Speaker 4: I think for [ORG-1]-I portal,
Agent: It's not data processing. No, it's merging data models together.
Speaker 4: It's like, okay, so you're saying you do something more like, I think they're all going to be small. It's literally just merging data together. It's not doing, you saw, like, I mean, it's a spider diagram.
Agent: You know, like
Speaker 4: This calls it, it's a call that.
Agent: I mean,
Speaker 4: It's merging small objects together into a larger
Agent: Core object. Right. Yeah, simple data transformation logic no more out of any doubt. Okay,
EndUser: You think it's more of that Okay.
Speaker 4: Than the second one, right?
EndUser: Sequential amplifiers with normal and routine logic. Yeah,
Agent: So 5 to 18 payload size up to [QUANTITY-1].
Agent: What does that mean?
Agent: Well, right this thing. So, you know, packets coming in are [QUANTITY-1] in terms of the complexity of it. Simple, medium and complex.
Agent: Kind of you know kind of fit into this simple logic you start getting into medium or complex You know medium or complex logic then you start coming up to here and the medium logic is You know if you're merging one or two or three systems together It can still be simple if
Speaker 4: You start merging, you know a half a dozen systems together in it Yeah, I want
Agent: To go up to a medium logic We're gonna be merging a bunch of small systems together a little air. Okay. Yep.
Agent: So if that's the case then let's go Go back to hear and sit there and say okay those five . are actually probably medium. I'm like, you know, maybe, maybe I'll say three two be on the high side.
Agent: Okay. Yep. Fair enough. And 28 and just to make sure we're good. That equals a total of 27. So now I'm going to go in. We're going to do this portal one the same way we did before.
Agent: We're going to use 29 smalls and three mediums, right?
Agent: So.
Agent: [PERSON-5] and three mediums comes out to six by five.
Agent: So if I come back here, this is a six and this is a five,
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: Now if
Agent: We do this for [GPE-2], you're saying it's about a third.
Agent: So seven okay is this assumption of being about a third of 13?
Agent: Yeah, that's fine. I think.
EndUser: Divided by three is two
Agent: Okay. It's a little bit of a round up there But one two and what a third of this is gonna be down
Speaker 4: To say three right?
Agent: Yeah All right, that gives us a total of I'm gonna assume they're all smalls. Yeah, they're all small Give me 9 there to do that.
Speaker 4: Okay
Agent: So let me skip that first thing.
Agent: All right So for this and these are gonna be exactly the same because [GPE-1] will be exactly the same, right?
Agent: So we're now we're going to do one with 9 smalls.
Agent: All right, that gives us 2 by 2.
Agent: If we come in here, then this is going to be 2.
Agent: So the total [GPE-3] demand is
EndUser: Going to be 10 production, 9 pre production. Simtini was 4 by 4 that gets the total of 10. Wow. I think we need to really look at [PERSON-6] because it's going to be back and heavy.
EndUser: So I want to be making sure like now we have its data heavy.
Speaker 4: It's not lightweight. Yes. It's like it's a 27V course, No.
Agent: So that I'll just admit
EndUser: It.
Speaker 4: Oh my god, look at that.
Agent: That is bad. I told [PERSON-4] [DATE-8] as we were going through this, I was like, we damn well better not hit 31.
Speaker 4: We're going to look like.
Agent: Please.
Speaker 4: Come. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, no, certainly. I think like, you know, I will make it as more medium than
Agent: Smaller and. Okay, so you want to change this say
EndUser: To like. Even more. Yeah,
Speaker 4: I think that should remember.
Agent: For five. Okay. [DATE-15] and five. All right, so let's go back here. Nineteen small. Five medium. That brings us
Speaker 4: Up to a four by four, right?
Speaker 4: That's a little square.
Agent: Yeah, it was a four by four. Yeah, I mean, some of those small tweaks don't really. make much difference. We all rounding up.
Agent: So if you look back to the here, you'll notice that it's 1.898409951572135, which is actually 3-point something, but it's rounding up before.
Agent: So if numbers, when you do that you see the fractions with that and you buffer, you'll see the rounding to a whole core.
EndUser: You tweak some of these
Agent: So you get a little bit of leeway. So tweaking the numbers just a little, that means your estimates don't have to be exactly right close.
EndUser: Just as long as they're pretty
Agent: Yeah, and what I'll do is once we drop off, I'll start and this is what we should have done actually. I'll do a separate app the projects.
Agent: For each one of
Agent: And then we can just add up. Instead of adding the rounded up number,
Agent: I'll just add up the
Agent: Not rounded. And then we'll get an accurate representation.
Agent: Right. So yes, and so the other way we can do this is a sanity check. We're saying 10 by 8. You're right. What we're saying though in, let's sign in and check that right now is we do that.
Agent: By 8. You 72 small, 8 mediums.
Agent: If we just go here just for fun, was it 98 by [DATE-15], I said?
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. We get 9 by 15. Our rounding helps gave us 8 by 15.
Agent: So we the rounding errors, if you want to call it that by rounding each individual number before adding them as opposed to rounding after the addition.
Agent: Um, gives us one additional core over what it would say it would be 10 by 8.
Agent: If we just put in these two two numbers, if you round with each one of these before adding, the end up at [DATE-13]. So it's a one-core difference in each environment.
Agent: I don't know if that helps,
Agent: [PERSON-3], but that, yeah. Grounding errors are not
Speaker 4: Huge, you know, a one-core difference. I'll be impressed if you show us that the 17 by [DATE-13].
Agent: The 13 by [DATE-15] is the same price as
Speaker 4: There
Agent: You go. Make that work. Yeah. So, [PERSON-7], I know you have to go. I don't want you to be late. I have, I just had a thought though for [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-8]. So, any other, any
EndUser: Questions for [PERSON-7] before
Speaker 4: He drops?
Agent: I think, good. Yeah. Okay, I'll be, I'll be very
EndUser: Quick with
Agent: My things. You guys have [TIME-3]. Sure. Yeah. I apologize. Let me jump.
Agent: Thank you guys
Speaker 4: And talk
EndUser: To you guys soon. Thank you. Yeah, bye. Bye.
Speaker 4: And it's way easier for me to get from
Agent: The claim. It is better just to the heads off. Yeah, we'll make that work. Yeah.
EndUser: We've all just
Speaker 4: Been traveling up to the [PERSON-8]. Yeah. Well, we've used the main brains.",How did the salesperson identify the buyer's specific situation and needs?,"The salesperson identified the buyer's specific situation and needs by:

Agent: 32 Hey, [PERSON-2], this is [PERSON-3] with [ORG-1].
Agent: How are you doing [DATE-1]?
Agent: Good, I'm just following up from [DATE-2]. Hope you had [TIME-1].
Agent: So yeah, I was just, again, to, I was just calling because I represent the [GPE-1] Salesforce team and we've been helping a lot of state agencies with grant management and considering your title, I just wanted to reach out.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: To A, introduce myself and B, learn more about how [GPE-2] police is currently handling grants.
EndUser: Okay. Well, my, currently I'm only the grant manager for one of our sections in the state police. It's basically the state police is broken up into four different branches. And then within those branches are different sections.
EndUser: So my department is part of the investigation branch. And under the investigations branch is our section, which is the forensic and technical services section.
EndUser: So the forensic and technical services section or FNTS, as we call it, that includes all of our forensic labs, which is [ORG-2] serology, trees, toxicology, drugs, and anthropology.
EndUser: And then we also have our forensic services, [ORG-3], which is our alcohol drug testing unit, ballistics unit, forensic imaging, and crime scene. So that's kind of what falls under our... hour section.
EndUser: So I'm basically just managing the grants for section.
EndUser: We have, I know in the branch, in our investigations branch, we probably have, gosh, about 18 plus grants that are being awarded every year throughout the branch and, you know, among the four sections of that branch.
EndUser: Right now I'm managing mainly our lab grants and a couple of, we have a highway traffic safety grant. We've got mostly our DNA grant and a pole cover del grant which covers our forensic labs.
EndUser: So I'm managing five or six grants out of... what the entire branch has. We also have a grants management unit for the state police.
EndUser: They basically are kind of the middleman between our grants managers in each of the sections and our offices of the attorney general and then eventually the federal grantors.
EndUser: So we kind of go through these layers of... You know, approvals and grants management and things like that. So, so I'm sort of the lowest on the totem pole, if you will.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But within our, within our investigations branch, like I said, we have about 18 plus grants. Most of the other grants are managed by enlisted members of the state police.
EndUser: So we have [PERSON-4] captains that are writing and managing those grants. Our section is a little bit unique in that we have one civilian who is me. managing several grants for this section.
EndUser: It's hard for me to kind of say, you know, this is how everything is done in the seat, please, because I know it's not. For the most part, the grants are managed by enlisted members of the organization.
Agent: Okay, no, thank you for this information.
Agent: And I guess a quick follow up would be, so do these four branches all kind of act independently?
Agent: Or is there like one person that decides how these four different branches operate?
EndUser: So they sort of, in terms of, specifically in terms of grants, they sort of act independently. Because each branch kind of has its own unique, I guess, provides unique services for the state.
EndUser: So, you know, our investigation branch actually includes Like I said, there's four sections in that branch. We have our intelligence and criminal Enterprise section. So that's like violent crimes, counter-terrorism, corruption.
EndUser: There's a special investigation section that's high-tech crimes, casino and gaming. And then we also have the regional operations and intelligence center, which is mainly... kind of our IT branch. So they do a lot of information and intelligence.
EndUser: They do infrastructure kind of investigations. So each of the sections even within each branch kind of does act independently, even though they are overseen by [PERSON-5] Colonel. So we have one [PERSON-5] Colonel in the investigations branch.
EndUser: And then we have the four sections under the investigations. And then each of those sections has a major that kind of oversees the operations of those sections. So we do kind of act independently.
EndUser: Only because our purposes are completely different.
Agent: Yeah, okay. No, thank you for this.
Agent: And I guess one more thing would be how is the current process?
Agent: Like, is there anything that's frustrating about it?
Agent: Because that's the thing we've been helping a lot of other state agencies with is, you know, kind of the day-to-day process of grant management.
Agent: So I wanted to learn more about how your current system works and if there's anything you know that's frustrating about it.
EndUser: Honestly, I think just from my perspective personally, I think the most frustrating thing is just, you know, like I said, we do have kind of these layers that we have to go through to have all of our applications and your progress reports and, you know, budget modifications, those all have to go through.
EndUser: Probably at least four people, you know, on top of me.
EndUser: So, and there's really no, we had actually looked at potentially, you know, some kind of software that we would be able to just be able to share, you know, all this information rather than, you know, I write a proposal up and then I have to.
EndUser: Email that proposal package to the next person and that person has to email it up to the [ORG-4]'s office and then the person at the [ORG-4]'s office has to read that and then it gets submitted to the federal portal.
EndUser: So there's just these layers that we have to go through.
EndUser: So I think for me that's the most frustrating, slash difficult part is that we don't have kind of a centralized... system, where whoever needs to see those applications or see whatever needs to be reviewed can just go in there.
EndUser: With a click of a button and see something. It's, we're sort of archaic in that sense, which I think is typical for a government agency.
EndUser: You know, but as far as I sort of have my own system just internally of how I do things, I'm the only one that manages the grants in our section.
EndUser: So I don't have, you know, a team of people on the one writing a grant, some of the one that is, you know, talking to the units about their needs assessments. Like we put the budgets together.
EndUser: We do all the progress reports. We do all the budget modifications, you know, all of that.
EndUser: So I kind of, when I started doing this, I kind of just, you know, on the fly made up a system that would work for me.
EndUser: And I think it would be nice if we did have some kind of centralized way of having, you know, my program manager be able to just open up a file and look at it rather than me having to email it to her or something.
EndUser: So, yeah, so I think that's really, really the frustrating thing. And I think that's.
EndUser: That's not a, that's kind of just a flaw on our part because, again, we're a government agency, we don't really have money to put into, we've actually looked at some kind of rent management software.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And we just, we couldn't really, we couldn't really pull the trigger on anything because really we were just looking for something for our section.
EndUser: That would work for our section, but it's something that would still have to go through, you know, state police as an overall. So that's kind of where we're sort of tied up with being able to do anything.
EndUser: Because every section, every branch, does apply for grants. So even though we sort of are on our own island, all this stuff would have to be approved.
EndUser: And there are a lot of different units that would have to be involved in getting some kind of centralized consistent program together.
Agent: Okay, I see. Well, no, thank you for that insight. I will say I know we have been helping with that exact issue when you said centralized. I was like, oh, that's exactly what we do.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: So I don't know if it would make sense. I would love to connect if you have [TIME-2] [DATE-3] or [DATE-4] just to connect around this.
Agent: Can I love to introduce you to my, my team. I know they would love to hear about, you know, how you guys are currently handling it.
Agent: Thank you for all this information and kind of show you how we've been helping state agencies with grant management.
Agent: Would you be open to connecting [DATE-4] or [DATE-3] for [TIME-3] call?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Well, I'll be, you know, just totally upfront with you. Because I, like I said, I'm kind of the lowest on the totem pole. I would love the information.
EndUser: I wouldn't be able to really make any of the decisions as far as whether we would even move forward with pursuing anything.
EndUser: So I think my My best bet would be to possibly just pitch the idea, not even necessarily like, you know, say, hey, I was just contacted by this company and they want to just give us a demo.
EndUser: I think even the idea is already there.
EndUser: It's just a matter of getting the right people to be able to say, okay, yeah, we would love to have something like this, you know, Let's put our forces towards... actually finding funding for it and things like that.
EndUser: So I, and the only reason I'm saying this is because we did have a couple of, we did have a couple of other representatives from other companies who were contacting us and we just, unfortunately, we couldn't move forward with anything because like I said, this is something that we'd have to, it's not something that, you know, even my major and my section would be able to, to decide on, you know.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So I honestly like I don't want to waste your time or my time with it. We normally have a branch grants meeting [DATE-5]. So I would say when that comes up, I could possibly bring that up again.
EndUser: We do have some options and if we did want to have somebody come in or just show us a demo or something, we could do that.
EndUser: But I think at this point, we're not necessarily ready to even think about doing anything.
EndUser: Just because it would be, for us, I think it would be, have to be something that's kind of more on a grander scale than just... You know, my little section of grants, so.
Agent: Yeah, no, totally. That totally makes sense. And I will say typically our first call at [ORG-1] is we just like to introduce ourselves. So it's not like a full demo or anything.
Agent: It more so be my boss essentially introducing himself and then learning about what you guys are doing and kind of showing what we do. And then we would move from there.
Agent: So it more so just be like an introductory call. If you'd be open to that, but it's not, I also totally understand.
EndUser: Yeah, like I said, I almost would rather just see, you know, kind of put the feeler out internally, just see whether this is something, you know, because this is something that we looked at probably.
EndUser: [DATE-6] and I think it was our, one of the, that happens in our investigations branch that pretty much said, you know, we, we just can't do this right now because we didn't have the manpower, where the funding to do anything.
EndUser: So I would kind of like to just internally see where we, where we stand with that before I, you know, commit to any phone calls or anything like that.
Agent: Totally.
Agent: So I guess my question would then be, is there any material I can send over your way that would be helpful for you?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, if you do have anything that kind of gives a synopsis of what you offer, you know, I know that some of the companies offer, you know, grant searching options and others even had, you know, grant writing assistance with grant writing and things like that.
EndUser: So, you know, whatever you have that, because like I said, we are. Our process here, at least mine, I take everything from start to, basically from start to finish. I don't do the actual, you know, electronic submissions.
EndUser: We do have, we do have our, or somebody at the [ORG-5]'s office that does that. But as far as, you know, writing and budgeting and things like that, that all starts right from each unit, basically.
EndUser: And each grant manager is responsible for that. So, you know, whatever tools you have that you might think would be helpful or any information you have about that, feel free to send that over.
EndUser: So, again, when I have that conversation with them, I can at least say, you know, this might be worth looking at because here's what's offered.
Agent: Perfect. We know I will then send over an email. to you right after this with some use cases and kind of how we've been helping state agencies with grants.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: So I will send that over. And you said the emails now is at njsp.gov.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Ok. Awesome. Well, I will send over that email right after this call. So you have some information to look at. And then you'll have my contact info will be in that email.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: And yeah, I just want to say thank you for your time. I'll send that over and then.
Agent: If there's anything, you know, if a grant management thing, a project starts to really move and you guys have any interest, please let me know.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: If not, when would you be an appropriate time for me to follow up?
EndUser: Um, we didn't have a meeting yet scheduled. Um, I would say probably won't be until [DATE-7].
EndUser: Like I said, we normally do [DATE-8] meetings, so it probably won't be until [DATE-9] or [DATE-10] that we actually meet with the branch grant coordinator.
Agent: Okay, okay. Well, no, that is great to know. So I will shoot over that email with my information. And if you need anything at all, please let me know.
Agent: And yeah, thank you for your time and I really appreciate it.
EndUser: Sure, no problem.
Agent: Awesome. You have a great one, [PERSON-6].

EndUser: I'm doing all right.
Agent: Hey, I saw your email. I appreciate you reaching back out. Um, I just want to make sure that understanding this correctly. As far as the Contract that [ORG-1] has with [ORG-2] division of IT.
Agent: I don't believe we have a Contract with them for them to dole out like licenses per se to utilize [ORG-1]?
Agent: Was there something in particular that you were looking to them for?
Agent: Right.
EndUser: I think this all stemmed from attending the webinar on the [PRODUCT-1] stuff that [ORG-1] does.
EndUser: Basically, I was told from our communications folks internally that because I forwarded the webinar information to our communications folks within [ORG-3] and they indicated that data to Contract with [ORG-1].
EndUser: And so anything that I needed to do, I just needed to work through communications, you know, regarding what could potentially be available through [ORG-1] that I might be able to get access through that contract.
EndUser: So that's all I know at this point.
Agent: Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I think that like [PERSON-3] do it.
Agent: Are people calling it that we use it over here?
EndUser: Yeah, don't do it. That's what they're calling it.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I just learned [DATE-1].
Agent: Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's what we've been calling it. I just didn't want to call it that if it wasn't what everyone else was calling it. So yeah, [PERSON-3] do it.
Agent: They do have They are utilizing sales force in some capacities, but not in a, not in like a centralized way yet. If that makes sense.
EndUser: Yeah, no. Yeah.
EndUser: And I, you know, I think we are, I mean, are, you know, it's one of those scenarios where I have to be careful what I talk about because we ever go out and procure something and we can be ineligible to bid on those things.
EndUser: So, you know, it, it just, at a very, very global level is, you know, within all the alignment that's going on with realignment around the state.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Which downdo it as one of those results of that is really trying to figure out how at the state level we're leveraging the tools that we have that are accessible.
Agent: Right. Mm hmm. Right. Mm hmm.
EndUser: So the Yearlife [GPE-1] scenario is we are at 29-7-345 pipeline. We're looking at leveraging other vendors to help us do our work better. I'm somewhat familiar of the [ORG-1] platform.
EndUser: That there are helpline centers that are using [ORG-1] to do the work, or they're helping, they're using it to do, you know, community referrals and closed loop referral type things.
Agent: Mm hmm. Right.
EndUser: So, you know, those are all the types of things that we're looking at, you know, as we move forward and it's, you know, and technologies work at light speed again, all these new things, especially with AI.
EndUser: And so just figuring out, As we are revision, I shouldn't say revisioning, or visioning where we're going to be as far as your life [GPE-1] and the type of technology that will be used to help us do better.
EndUser: Because the reality for your life [GPE-1] is that it, all the work that's done by your life [GPE-1] is procured. So we procure a health line center. So they have their own IT.
EndUser: They have to be able to connect to a number. They need to be able to answer phone text and chat. We don't tell them what IT system they have to use.
EndUser: We just say you need to have the capability to do that.
EndUser: So we're not in a position to say, hey, you must use [ORG-1], or you must use [ORG-4], or you must use [ORG-5], or any of the other different vendors that do call centers type stuff.
EndUser: That makes sense?
Agent: Call center type, yeah call center type stuff like what would that be?
EndUser: So call center stuff, you know, so we your life. I was phone text and chat. I mean, you can go out and take a look at our website your life.
EndUser: I went.org if you wanted to kind of get a sense of more of what we are. They have phone text and chat, you know, that's all coming in through You know the phone and text is handled.
EndUser: You know, by foundation to who is our contractor and [GPE-2]. And so they have a way to handle that. You know, contractually they have to be up 29 be able to take the calls and the text.
EndUser: They have a chat portal that they're using. I think, [DATE-2]. Five nine is now the vendor that they're using for. the chat portal, we just launched a brand new piece.
EndUser: But some of the behind the scenes things that is a thorn in the side is kind of like that closed loop referral system that I mentioned earlier, where someone who calls your life file or reaches out via the website that we can make a referral through a closed loop system to ensure that individual actually make contact, got engaged.
EndUser: And we can say, yes, job all done. We got to where we needed to do. A lot of that is right now is we, it's not closed loop right now. We'll provide information referrals.
EndUser: In some cases, we'll do direct referrals via warm handoff. But we don't have that closed loop referral system and the Integration with other state systems to be able to track that person through the system.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: And so there are just a lot of things we're talking about at the state levels.
EndUser: So how do we do this better and better serve [NORP-1]?
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Does that all make sense?
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: That may be way more information than I should have cared.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. No.
EndUser: But anyway.
Agent: No. No, I appreciate the insight. It definitely shed some light on it.
Agent: Yeah, we definitely hear that a lot of, you know, you've got the features on the front end when it comes to the text, the call, the chat, but the internal system of like, Having a case get started and go all the way through to the resolution to closing the loop.
Agent: You know, that's an issue that we hear people definitely struggling with. The other thing too, you mentioned the Integration with other state systems to like track folks.
Agent: Integration is also a thing that's just like tough that the people struggle with. We actually have a tool that is vendor agnostic, including [ORG-1], like you don't need [ORG-1] to utilize it.
EndUser: Mm hmm.
Agent: It's called [NORP-2].
Agent: Have you heard of it by any chance?
EndUser: Ok, no, I have not.
Agent: Essentially, it's utilized for API management and then just Integration purposes.
EndUser: Gotcha. Yep.
Agent: So just so that way you have two separate, two disparate systems that You don't want either of them to change, but you want them to be able to share information for data across both sides.
Agent: That's where [NORP-2] kind of is a plug-in and can be utilized in that way.
EndUser: Gotcha.
Agent: So that way those systems can operate as efficiently as possible. We'll also having the data from either side being able to kind of help each other.
Agent: But if that's something that would be interesting to you or if you want to learn more about like the, you know, closed loop Case Management side of things.
EndUser: Ok. Yeah.
Agent: I mean, our team is always up for, just education about what we do and learn more about what you all do.
EndUser: Yeah, no.
Agent: In knowing that, you know, it's going to come down to a procurement eventually at some point, you know, we're not trying to sell you anything [DATE-3].
EndUser: Yeah, right. And I think, [PERSON-4] at this point, those are the conversations I need to have with [PERSON-5] do it. And since that's where the [ORG-6] resides to figure out what next steps are.
Agent: Uh-huh. Gotcha.
EndUser: So that, you know, I don't want to get my hand slapped for going out and being rogue. So if that makes sense, no, I appreciate the conversation.
Agent: Okay. Right.
EndUser: I appreciate the information.
EndUser: Um, and I can, you know, [PERSON-6] is my contact with, with an [GPE-1] [ORG-7] and just say, hey, you know, how do we, what's the next step?
EndUser: And I was kind of waiting to be in on the webinar [DATE-4], I think, and do what. type of visioning my brain comes up with saying, hey, we can do this.
EndUser: And now, you know, that you've mentioned, [PERSON-7] is, you know, is that another way to get at some of the things that we're trying to do.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But there's, there's a lot of other things regarding protected health information and being able to link individuals through data systems. There's a lot that the state has to talk about before we even get there.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: So there are, you know, someone we're talking about a closed loop system.
EndUser: That's kind of like a first step of being, can we just do it internally within your life file and that we can ensure everybody who reaches out gets connected to who what the services that they're seeking.
EndUser: And we, we've got a couple of things in play that have been. [PERSON-8], sculptor over [DATE-5], but. And that's all because of the realignment. work that's been done at the state.
EndUser: So a lot of things have just been a little scattered and that type of thing. So, but I appreciate your reach now appreciate the additional information.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: I know where to find you.
Agent: So, Yeah, and then if anything comes up from the webinar [DATE-4] that you know you're more curious about, I can share resources, get you connected with the right people.
EndUser: Perfect.
Agent: And then the other thing too you mentioned with the closed loop system, you know, trying to get people those resources they need.
EndUser: Ok.
Agent: The other resource that we have is like our digital engagement side of the house, which instead of kind of like a case resolution, it serves as like a journey builder is what we call it to where you build out like Messaging that you want to send to them via email via text.
Agent: And then you can build out that journey depending on how they respond to those items. So it could be, you know, someone reaches out about a gambling problem.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: And so then you're able to then send them a resource via email about gambling. And then you have that journey of like, okay, and like [DATE-6] will hit them up with more Messaging about it.
Agent: It kind of helped along that journey to recovery.
EndUser: What's that called?
Agent: Those are like some other ways. That's still source [PRODUCT-2] is what it's called.
Agent: And it be like the journey builder capabilities of it. Which is really neat because it's like. It's clicks not code.
Agent: So like to be able to set that up, you're just, you know, using a mouse to like change the build out the journey itself. So it's really cool.
EndUser: Who owns the [ORG-8] for that journey builder as far as the Messaging and stuff?
EndUser: Is that something we build out?
Agent: Yeah, yeah, that would be something that would be owned by you all.
EndUser: Gotcha.
Agent: Yeah, and when it comes to data and like trust is like our number one priority, it was that before [PRODUCT-1] and how especially after AI, Your data is your data, even though it's sitting in a, you know, it's in a [ORG-1] platform, like we all own any rights to that data.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Okay. Again, I think there's definitely some things to talk about as we're looking to where we might be going.
EndUser: And I know one of our vendors are working, you know, they're talking about potentially being able to put some interfaces on the website. You know, and handle our contact forms and our quizzes and be more interactive.
EndUser: That, you know, hey, if you score here, here's five or six different things you can do.
Agent: Mm-hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. Mm hmm. [PERSON-9].
EndUser: You know, it sounds a little bit the same as sort of like this journey builder you were talking about. So, yeah, it sounds like there's definitely some things to talk about in that maybe something after the webinar [DATE-4].
EndUser: I just reach out back to our communications so we can see whether we can set up and see what is available to us through the state Contract that exists right now that we can leverage.
EndUser: And if there isn't, then what potential next steps would be.
Agent: Okay. Yeah. That sounds great.
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: What was nice trying with you again, [PERSON-1]?
Agent: Yeah. If anything comes up, you know, [PERSON-5] has to reach out. We're a resource here for you.
EndUser: Yep, no, appreciate it. Thanks, [PERSON-4].
Agent: Yeah, take [PERSON-1].

Agent: I'm great.

EndUser: Oh, Doing very well, thank you for asking.
Agent: That's awesome. Well, you know, I just happy new here, even though it's [DATE-1] and I haven't talked to you in a while.
EndUser: I Right, right, happy [EVENT-1] to you too.
Agent: Wish all good things for you.
EndUser: I hope. Oh, thank you very much. How thanks video.
Agent: Good. They're very busy. We just had [DATE-2] at [DATE-3]. So it's been wonderful and great and we're now like kicking off a brand [DATE-4].
EndUser: So That's very good. That's yeah. [DATE-5] is. Hey, we just finished [DATE-6]. It's going fast. Yeah, yeah.
Agent: Fast!
EndUser: Yes, yes, absolutely.
Agent: Isn't it crazy?
Agent: I know when you last spoke, you were telling me I was learning, you were helping me learn so much about like the tracking of natural gas and all the goals and priorities.
Agent: And I just wanted to step back to you because I know it was, you know, it's been [DATE-7] since we spoke.
EndUser: And
Agent: And just kind of wanted to sync and check in for [DATE-8].
Agent: And to see if your team is open to having conversations about the priorities.
EndUser: Actually, after the first, we had some reorganizing around our office and we were moved from one location to another, not the location in terms of physical location from one office to another.
Agent: Oh.
EndUser: I mean, we're under different management, basically. That's what I'm trying to say. But we are under the same deputy director under administration.
EndUser: So part of the administration is ETS and the ETS is tasked to build a complete new system. for our program to accommodate everything, of course, of all the business needs.
EndUser: Now ETS right now is more in charge of what direction, what's needed, what kind of software, what kind of ads on they're gonna bring to our program.
EndUser: So currently from my end, from my role is just more of telling them this is what we do, and it's up to them how they wanna, construct or build or develop that software.
Agent: Ah, bye-bye.
EndUser: My understanding from some of the programmers that I've met with is going to be built from scratch because it's very customized
EndUser: Program. It's one of the most complex natural gas program in the, I think, in the state and naturally on the state.
EndUser: So they want to look at it from every single perspective to make sure the modifications or the customization fits exactly our business need. But it's going to be written in-house.
EndUser: And that's where it was initially a long time ago, the debate, okay, should we bring should we do you bring the software from outside and modify it to fit our need or should we start from scratch.
EndUser: And now they have started from scratch and they start to I mean, they got they have the team. project managers and project manager and business analyst developers and testers. Everybody is dedicated now to build this software.
EndUser: They put some timeline on it. I'm not sure if anything I can help you with from my end, but if you want, I can just, I think probably I mentioned something like this last time.
EndUser: I can maybe let the project manager, which we have a new one, just started maybe [DATE-9], [DATE-10].
EndUser: I can't tell her here from [ORG-1], they're calling if there is anything they can do and help with this project. Here's the information, her number, and she can go, she can decide.
EndUser: But from my end, only in terms of system, I'm only just communicating with ETS, nobody else. Even in the past when we have some vendors just seeking. to understand our project and see if they can jump on it.
EndUser: I'll write a help. Now it's just on the ETS, so the ETS. And ETS, I think, I'm not sure on that, and caught me in that.
EndUser: I think they're allowed if there is a need to consult with third party or I'm sure something like this, they have to run an RFP.
EndUser: And if they're requesting for any consultation, but currently I know that we have enough programmers on the team. There is team developers, architects and designers that are looking into building the entire project from [FAC-1].
Agent: That's really exciting and thank you so much for the update and the information and looping me into that. It's a big and very important project as you were saying, like the scope of natural gas is very complex.
Agent: And it's exciting. I'm sure your in-house team will do extremely well with the whole support of all the developers, project managers and everyone on board collectively. you know, pitching in to accomplish such a big goal.
Agent: We are, we do have small things that like are agnostic.
Agent: So even though you're building your own program, there's things that like can bolt on and help or to pull the data out of past things and have that API exchange and being able to work with what you're building easier.
Agent: So, you know, there could be small things that could help. So I would love to speak with the new project manager just so they know what's available.
EndUser: Nice.
Agent: And then that way they can reach out if the need ever does come.
Agent: But it's just more for like awareness, you know, like if you need this in the future, this is how other agencies have solved that use case or problem, you know, in the past.
Agent: So, and, you know, sometimes it is just very small things, which is fine, you know, because we appreciate all the work that you're doing in the state, and, you know, we want to be able to support that and, you know, ultimately it's about giving the best service to the families.
EndUser: Absolutely, [DATE-11] I have the meeting with the entire team. I mean, ETS team and project manager are going to be there. I'll just mention that I've saved the call and there's things maybe you might help with.
EndUser: And the author, I'm going to pass the information to her so she can take it from there and either communicate with you.
EndUser: And if she said there is no need or at all, I'm going to just email you and just tell you, OK, by the way, I just passed your information.
EndUser: And if they want to communicate with you, it's completely up to them from that point to see.

Agent: Do you have a quick second for my call?
EndUser: What can I do for you?
Agent: Yeah, so I know that you're within analytics for a long list and I was just giving you a quick call.
Agent: We actually just hosted here at [ORG-1] a data and [ORG-2] workshop for companies in your industry and I think you were looking at some of our Marketing products in the past.
Agent: So just wanted to see if you'd want a quick recap.
EndUser: At this prime, probably not something I think we over here actually need anything.
EndUser: But if you want to shoot me over just kind of some information as an email, I'd take a look into it, but it's not something that we're currently trying to find or look into or get a new platform or anything like that.
EndUser: But I could go over what you have to offer and see if it's still in any interest.
Agent: Yeah, so what exactly are you guys using for the company right now in terms of marketing?
EndUser: As for like, are you talking like a CRM?
Agent: No, just like for your Marketing instance, do you have like a separate one other than that's like tandem with your CRM?

Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But yeah, one of the difficulties that we have here is that we have a [PRODUCT-1]. trying to integrate with our main platform, all of our order systems, how we purchase our flooring.
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: It's just, we're working with some archaic systems.
Agent: Yeah. So like talked to a lot of different companies are using different systems. You said you're using [PRODUCT-1] the [FAC-1] and I do see that you have a guy. order now feature in your website.

EndUser: Plus we're using some of the software that we use or, you know, some of the reports we use inside reporting and so on. They're having a problem, you know, getting a lot of that done.
EndUser: So he just, he wasn't in a comfortable place, I guess.
Agent: Okay, I gotcha.
Agent: From the conversation that does it sound like [ORG-2] is going to be a player in the game whenever you guys decide to do something with your tech?
EndUser: I don't know, man. It just.
EndUser: So what it is, so what, you know, some of the stuff that you gave me on the or the [QUANTITY-1] view is, you know, it could Kind of streamline a lot like we're using a lot of individual programs that don't work as seamlessly well as What your stay and sales force will do so.
EndUser: I mean, I think you would be crazy not to but he's not one that's uh, he's not an early adopter so you know what i mean so he's so i am so i'm a big fan of her being an earlier talk but he's not so you know it's just you have to deal with that you know so it's kind of like you know i can buck a weave like a speedboat and say and let's do this put him play and work at the kinks but yeah he's more like you know stand up for you so i mean hit me up in [DATE-1] the summertime for him usually isn't that bad and their stuff, you know, so it's not, you know, it usually isn't like a lot of the stuff that we're doing now that we tax him with.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: He's also a general manager in one of our locations.
Agent: Yeah, it sounds like you, where's a lot of hats.
EndUser: So he does, he does, and you know, and I don't know how he ended up being the head of the IT role, kind of by proxy, but he's not like himself, he's not a big IT guru.
EndUser: So he's a real organized guy.
Agent: Got to.
EndUser: By guesses at Mr. [PERSON-3], he's been with the company a long time, like [DATE-2] So, you know, I think it's one of those ones, you know, early on, you know, gained a lot of trust.
EndUser: He just gradually took over with these jobs. So he's a sharp guy. He's big on a lot of stuff. He's just not an early adopter. But I mean, what you told me...
EndUser: I think it would be a good idea because we're using multiple platforms now and you know that works.
Agent: I appreciate it.
EndUser: They don't always seamlessly integrate with each other. So I like yours. It gives everybody a creative degree of touch of a customer no matter what the department they're in or anything. So I honestly think that's pretty decent.
Agent: Absolutely. Yeah, and with that, like we do have other auto dealers that have been already been using [ORG-2] for a while. So if you think hearing like some customer stories around, I
EndUser: Anyone in the [GPE-1] area?
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Anyone in the [GPE-1] area?
EndUser: Or northern [GPE-2]?
Agent: Would have to check the locations for them.
EndUser: Alright.
Agent: I've got a list that kind of shows a bunch of them.
Agent: Yeah, if you think it'd be helpful to see some customer stories of how other dealerships are using us and like what they've been able to do with the platform, I'm happy to send it over if you think that'll help.
EndUser: Yeah, it can't hurt. But look, give me a favor. If you can check, too, or if you can list some of the dealers using it, if we know any, but you know how it is.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: It's like if you know somebody, like whenever I got a resume, somebody works somewhere with somebody I know, I call them right away.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It's a treat, skinny.
EndUser: So, you know, if we got somebody that's using it, like, even me, if we get to that point and we would do it, what I, you know, typically do when I'm looking at a new piece of software or new, you know, piece of equipment or whatever, I say, well, you know, who's got it now or if it's software, you know, who, who's not going to stuff, you know, who's really investing in it.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And then I'll call that person. And then sometimes I would go, I mean, I'd go fly out to wherever they were and spend [DATE-3] with them or whatever, because there's no better.
EndUser: Source than people actually putting it into practical application.
EndUser: So they're going to speak my language, you know what I mean?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And whereas if you're coming from your side, you're going to give you that perspective which is fine. But no matter how good a product is, it has to be put into practical application.
EndUser: So I usually like to take it from the guys we have. But if you have any dealers, any dealer groups in [GPE-3], [GPE-1], somewhere, we even have [GPE-4] too.
EndUser: But if you have, but preferably [GPE-1] or [GPE-3], there's a lot of big groups in that area. That would be great. If you could send that to me, that would be wonderful.
Agent: Yeah, I'll go ahead and I'll drum that up. I'll send that over.
Agent: I know we've got a few of them Oh, I think pretty close that area So I'll send that and see what you think and then yes If you want to get like a next step set up as far as seeing some demos getting some hands-on with us outside of Obviously working with those guys that are using it We'd be happy to do that really whatever is easiest to help you guys figure out if this is something that's going to work for you Or not because at [DATE-4], we don't we don't want to sell you software That's not going to work But at the same time like it sounds like we have a good opportunity and I want to make sure we explore it Okay.
EndUser: Yet with a word i don't right
EndUser: Now that it's it sounds i mean look it does i mean it's very logical you know it it's very light it seems to be logical being a thing to do so but just uh... we used to be look it wasn't until probably [DATE-5] We were very, again, it's a company that was, you know, it was, you know, it's privately earned.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And Mr. [PERSON-3] had it, so it grew up, he had a lot of relationships. And we were locked into some software companies just because of relationships.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And then that started to change, but then they started like using different providers for different things. And when they're fragmented, like I said, that don't always work well together. So that's kind of where we're at now.
EndUser: So being able to kind of bring it all together. And I like how.
EndUser: Particularly your solution with the front end of the back end can view that customer and kind of know what's going on with them That's that's actually pretty sweet So I don't know that I'm the one that needs as much selling on it I'm probably one of the ones that are the concept is good enough for me You know and then we'll put it in but if you can find some of those people that are using it I'll reach out to them and then you know I'll get there [MONEY-1] on how it works and then if I get that or those kind of testimonials or Hopefully if there's somebody we know You know what I mean?
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: I get the straight skinny from them. And then I would get that person in [PERSON-4]'s ear. That'll go a long way.
Agent: Absolutely.
Agent: Yeah, that's actually what I was going to ask next to, It sounds like obviously you're a fan of the platform so far, which I think is great, but I was going to see do you think it's better?
EndUser: Yeah. Well, because we haven't, I mean, we have a dull vendor with, but I mean, I've got you, you know, like I say, you gave me the 23,000 point for you.
Agent: Yeah Yeah
EndUser: So [LOC-1] looked nice from as we were flying over it. But, you know, but yeah, no, I'm so, so far, I'm interested, so that's for sure.
Agent: That's good.
Agent: So in your opinion, do you think as far as like next steps of communication?
Agent: Am I good to still go through you for some of this or do you want me to reach out to [PERSON-4] directly?
Agent: Like I'm happy to do whatever you think is okay.
EndUser: No no no i know he would be with stonewall you like all right up front so i mean you would absolutely be hit the brick wall so no rep run through merely let me go ahead and kind of build the case and then i see him you know i see him fairly often so um... you know all uh... if i said hey man look marvellous talking about this will look i got to know fell on it so i was using [DATE-6] but they did it like it i want that saw it and i thought that really need to talk about and there's other people in there too that have to come into it so but you know I think that's the start because all of us here, I'm probably one of the earliest adopters.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I'm a big fan of leveraging technology. When you have to lay it in, it's a lot of change. Stuff doesn't always work seamlessly.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You got to work out to Kings. Quite honestly, [ORG-2] is a monster. I like working with software, I mean, well, the software technology companies when they're small, before the big conglomerates have bought them up.
EndUser: Because they're more nimble, they're more, you know, and they're emotionally attached to the product. So, like, if you need some enhancement or some change, like, we're using a company now for our video multi-points called [ORG-3].
EndUser: And they're still pretty small. I think they've been around eight, nine years. They haven't been bought up by anybody yet, but they probably will be approached.
EndUser: So when they go in and we need something done or something doesn't work, I mean, they're in there right away and they're working on the programming.
EndUser: And then of course, when you deal with that little stuff, because they'll tend to do it quick, as what the smaller companies do.
EndUser: And then you know with software, then a lot of times you'll end up with unintended consequences, and you have to work through those.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And I'm real okay with that.
Agent: Yeah, you fix this here and you break this there.
EndUser: I'm... Exactly, but see I'm totally okay with that because I know it comes because by the time a [ORG-4] gets to a big company.
EndUser: So we use [ORG-5] automotive for a lot of stuff So by the time something gets the [ORG-5] or like in our business rentals and rentals is one of the biggest is our management system they by the time they get it they want to monetize everything and Changes are going to come out of snail space.
EndUser: You know the only way they're going to make it change their product if they feel one they have to or they're going to have a mass exodus or they see an opportunity to go ahead and enhance it.
Agent: Mm hmm. Yeah.
EndUser: Because if you look at like you sound like a pretty young guy but I mean it's not too long ago.
EndUser: So you know like [ORG-6] radio, you go back [DATE-7] they were pricked to deal with and they basically were kind of like well hey take it and leave it here's the rate it's what it is boom and now they're humble as hell.
EndUser: Because there's a million different ways you can go in. So a lot of these, hell yeah, there's so many ways.
Agent: That's true. Yeah, they've got a lot of competition.
EndUser: I mean, they'll practically give it to you now, you know?
EndUser: So, you know, but these big companies, that's a lot of them still take that approach. The small ones are a little more nimble.
EndUser: So yeah, give it to me first, let me do it, and then I'll present it to them because I do a lot of that.
EndUser: I'll come up like, hey, man, I really should look at this, you know?
EndUser: So that'll work.
Agent: Perfect. Yeah, I'll give those references and send them over. And I just wanted to make sure I wasn't like hounding your bug and you're anything.
EndUser: No i don't know i meant to shoot you back you hit me at tax that was down visit my grandson at the college and i did not like i got the [NORP-1] so you you have my you have my email address right yeah yeah that's it okay cool all right yeah i don't really like calls to be honest with you Nathan i need to put you in as a contact because a lot of times they don't answer it but i know indiana i thought that was you but I, because you get so many crank calls, so I'm actually gonna throw your, I'll make a contact out of that number so you can call me.
Agent: So that's good to hear.
Agent: Oh, no worries. Hopefully that was a good time.
Agent: I think so. It's just a Moylan J at [FAC-1]. Good stuff.
Agent: Do you prefer that I call you or do you prefer email?
Agent: Because I can do either one.
Agent: Yep, that's me.
EndUser: But I can't always answer it, so depending on where I am, I might hit you back, is this a cell phone?
Agent: This is, yeah, this is my cell phone.
EndUser: But, okay, yeah, because what I'll do a lot of times, if I'm in the middle of something, I'll just hit you back, one of those please text me, you know.
EndUser: If I shoot you that, it means I can't talk to you right now, that's all.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But yeah, you're more than welcome to call it, I'm not a...
Agent: Okay, perfect. Yeah, if you prefer email text, we can do that. This is my cell phone, like I said, so call me text me whatever works best for you and
EndUser: Oh, texting is my favorite. That's my favorite. And I didn't mean not to reply to you. I did. I was just off.
Agent: No, you're.
EndUser: And it was kind of like, you weren't front and center in my mind. I'll be honest with you.
Agent: Oh, I completely understand that. Yeah, you got way more pressing things going on.
EndUser: Well, now, wasn't that.
Agent: Don't worry.
EndUser: I was actually off. I was actually doing family stuff. So I was preoccupied.
Agent: Yeah, which is good.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah, well, good stuff.
EndUser: All right.
Agent: I'll get those references sent over. And hopefully, we find one that you guys are pretty familiar with and we can get some more dialogue going.
EndUser: Thanks.
Agent: But I appreciate your time on the phone, [PERSON-1]. All right, thank you, sir.
EndUser: Not a problem, [ORG-1]. I'll talk to you later. All right.
Agent: Have a good one.

008619_167_0LQ3y000008cbj5GAA,"Agent: Hey [PERSON-1], this is [PERSON-2] calling from Salesforce Tableau.
Agent: How are you doing [DATE-1]?
EndUser: Good, how are you?
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Doing good. Thanks for asking. I don't want to take up too much of your time. Just wanted to introduce myself. I'm actually new to the account team for [ORG-1] here at [GPE-1].
Agent: So just wanted to introduce myself, see if there's anything we could do to help you with [GPE-1] related. Just go from there.
EndUser: So obviously I'm just getting started. I used [GPE-1] for a little bit, you know, probably over [DATE-2]. The agency that I had been working, that I worked with was using a product called [ORG-2] by the [GPE-2].
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: That was basically our visualization suite.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And in with [ORG-1] value, you know, there's, I can see a need, at least with myself, of being able to visualize different data, syndicated data that we have on like handsets. And I'm actually doing work in the i-spot.
EndUser: So, you know, obviously I want to see how I can utilize [GPE-1] and the different dashboard capabilities to make those visualizations easier and more accessible than just doing static decks and going back to my previous lives of having that capability.
EndUser: I'm still working through the nuances and differences that [GPE-1] is versus what I was used [DATE-3] with On the Scope. It's pretty intuitive.
EndUser: I just need to probably take maybe, you know, I went through all the training. That was actually really helpful. The training videos.
EndUser: Maybe a bit more of an intermediate type of [GPE-1] training, I don't know if you have any videos with, you know, a bit more intermediate.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: But that maybe would get me into where I want to take this. Again, I don't have a lot of time available right now to devote to it.
EndUser: I'm hoping to be able to free up some time to spend more time on it. It's not critical to my responsibilities, but it's not necessarily a nice to have. I would like it to have it to be more.
Agent: Right, and it's a. Yeah, just out of curiosity, would it just be yourself using the platform or do you have a team that would also be, you know, utilizing [GPE-1] if it were something that you guys, you know, solve value and But right now it's,
EndUser: Know, I, I mean, I, I'm part of the insights team within [ORG-1]'s value, the value organization or all the prepaid brands within [ORG-1]. So you have [ORG-3] side, [ORG-4], the market, the market insights.
EndUser: You've probably got digital analytics people. On that side. And then on the value side, it's all the track phone brands that came over with the acquisition plus visible and [ORG-1] free page. That's one big portfolio.
EndUser: And I'm a part of the insights team and I handle competitive intelligence and secondary research and market insights. And I have two other people that work on the primary side, [ORG-5].
EndUser: So there could be some dash, I know that dashboard is a buzzword right now, at least within value.
EndUser: So there probably will be opportunities to look to visualize some of the quantitative data that they get from their surveys, whether it's from [ORG-6] or one of our vendors that we use. So there could be a possibility there.
EndUser: I basically just got approval for the desktop and the data prep from my boss really as a hey I'd like to really explore this and see what we can do because I just got put in gave a given access to [ORG-7] I know they have an API so I'd like to play around with that I have a vendor that provides excel reports that the data prep would be really useful on the scope the suite that I had used [DATE-4].
Agent: All
Agent: Right.
EndUser: They had a drag and drop data prep built in. So it's very similar to the data prep module that is [GPE-1]. So I know that would allow me to merge.
EndUser: Join, do filtering, and that kind of, get the data prep to this, it would be static data that would be updated over time to get that into a workable, larger file, because there's [DATE-5] reports, there's [DATE-6] reports, There's also, I think, biweekly reports.
EndUser: So to get them all in one flat file would be ideal. without me having to do it all manually in [PRODUCT-1]. So there's also that component.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: So, and I know that there are a few other people within value, [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4], who also, I think, just got, it just got licenses for the desktop. They're using it for a bit different purpose.
EndUser: They're not on the insights team, but they also, they do with, presentations and Marketing data and that kind of thing. So that would certainly be on their side.
EndUser: Not really sure about who else, but from the insights team, I know I'm taking the lead on exploring the capabilities of [GPE-1] and seeing what can, what it can do for us.
EndUser: There may be a, not a need for the other two two get licenses. If I become the expert and okay, I can build the dashboard for you.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Um, that kind of thing. So I'm not necessarily sure if all three of us on the inside team will need licenses, but you know, that can of course be discussed down the road.
EndUser: I don't see a budgetary issue with that.
EndUser: Just the necessity issue, is it really needed at this point?
EndUser: Probably not. And maybe not even in the future if I become the de facto person.
Agent: Right. Okay. Awesome. Well, I appreciate that. That's honestly all great detail. So.
EndUser: I try to give as much context as possible to the much transparency and context.
Agent: Yeah, no, that was great. Yeah, no, that was great. I appreciate it. Well, obviously, [ORG-1] has a pretty big blueprint with [GPE-1]. I know there's a great partnership there.
Agent: What I can do for you is I actually work directly alongside the two account executives that oversee all [GPE-1] for [ORG-1].
Agent: So what I can do is I can set up like a [TIME-1] introduction call, really just to introduce you to them, kind of where they play in the whole relationship.
Agent: It's a great contact just to have if you ever need anything down the road.
EndUser: Yup.
Agent: We can kind of go over the use cases, how you plan to use [GPE-1], see if maybe we can help you best utilize the platform and just see if we can get that going.
EndUser: Absolutely. Best practices if I'm stuck on something, why yes, because I've even had questions on I spot and I spot is pretty intuitive.
EndUser: And I've reached out to the lead account executive there, the lead account manager and I'm like, hey, I'm trying to get this.
EndUser: Can you help me?
EndUser: He's like, yup, here. He does have to do this. So just having that. available is ideal. That would be great.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. What is a good time slot for you either [DATE-7] or [DATE-8] just for [TIME-2]. Looks like [DATE-9].
EndUser: Let me take a look.
Agent: There's some openings in [DATE-10].
EndUser: See.
EndUser: [DATE-9] is actually pretty open. My only things booked right now is [DATE-10], and then 1 to 2. But other than that, I'm available. I'm [ORG-8], too.
Agent: Awesome, I'm also [ORG-9] so that makes it pretty easy. You want to do 10 to 10
EndUser: Yeah, that sounds good.
Agent: Ok, perfect.
Agent: Let's shoot for 10 to 10 And if we need to change it, leading up to more than happy to do that, I'll make the Google Meet invite to where, if you want to add anyone on this call, feel free.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: It's really just going to be an introduction, like I said, pretty basic. And if we need to set up something else from there.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: That's perfect. The account executives aren't necessarily a technical resource, but they can get you any of the resources that you need.
EndUser: With perfect.
EndUser: Excellent. Yeah, no, it'll probably just be myself for now since it's just the short call.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. [PERSON-5], [PERSON-6]. Well, I'm going to get this sent over to your email.
Agent: Is it [ORG-10] or me at [ORG-10]?
EndUser: Correct.
Agent: Perfect. I'm going to get this invite sent over to you. It's going to be a [ORG-10] meet invite. If you can just accept it whenever you do get it, that'd be perfect.
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: I also include a little agenda on there. But otherwise, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out and we look forward to speaking on [DATE-9].
EndUser: Excellent. Sounds good. Talk to you on [DATE-9].
Agent: [PERSON-7]. I appreciate it. Have a good one.
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Yeah, bye.

EndUser: Hello?
EndUser: Hey,
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-1], this is [PERSON-2] with [ORG-1].
Agent: How you doing?
EndUser: What's going on?
Agent: Yeah, um, you and I had a conversation kind of way back in [DATE-1] and you asked me to follow up with you close to [DATE-2]. And we had some time on the calendar for [DATE-3].
Agent: So I'm reaching out to the folks that are sitting on my [DATE-3] call list and seeing whether or not it's a priority going to [DATE-2]. To talk about [PRODUCT-1], that is.
EndUser: No, of course, yeah, I've used your system before. I would probably say based on kind of the interest rate environment that we're in now, it's starting to kind of turn our direction.
EndUser: So, for me to use a [PRODUCT-1] at this point, you know, I love your system for the click through, meaning click the dial, which I probably, you know, that's the way I used it.
Agent: Does that exciterate
EndUser: I don't use it for like an overall overhaul of a CRM system, so to speak.
Agent: Issue with a Sirensifying Act?
Agent: Hi, its Mm-hmm. You have your contacts, you have your tasks, and you're following up on your task, click the dial.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I think I have more of just kind of data mining business within the within your [PRODUCT-1]. I mean, I just have a bunch of stuff. And when I have a hard lead application.
EndUser: Conversation, I'm trying to convert them. I put them in my kind of my loan officer software, if that makes sense.
Agent: Yeah, the [GPE-1]
EndUser: So I'm using yours as more of a kind of an outbound engine, if you will.
Agent: Yeah, it's like a place where you keep all of your prospects, all of the people you've, you know, shook hands with at a dinner party.
EndUser: No, not even sure, [GPE-2], yes, maybe. I don't go to a lot of trade shows. I'm talking just hard leads, cold calling.
Agent: Right, okay.
EndUser: You know, just, you know, they don't know me from, you know, [DATE-4], you know, type people.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.
EndUser: I'm bugging them at dinner time.
EndUser: I mean, you're, you know, I'm trying to turn a cold call list into a warm list and then once it becomes a warm list and then app them or have that deeper conversation, I then convert them to a different.
Agent: I just Yeah, what [PERSON-3] do you have?
EndUser: Use my, you know, just from applications through lending pad.
Agent: Okay, I need that.
EndUser: Yeah, it's not, you know, it's not a outbound.
Agent: Nothing.
Agent: Are you?
EndUser: It's not a prospecting type tool, if you will. It's more of a, you know, it's what I'm in.
Agent: Yeah, it's your origination software for the loans.
EndUser: When there are definitely a prospect, you know,
Agent: Are you part of a broader mortgage company [GPE-3] home loans?
EndUser: We are. That's kind of our [ORG-2], but my brokers is, you don't want to call them because we're all independent, you know, so like you call in my broker is not going to like move the needle for you.
Agent: Mm
Agent: Hmm. Yeah, you're 1175 and then he's.
EndUser: Yeah, we'll move the needle for you, so speak.
Agent: I mean, Would you consider him like a rental broker?
EndUser: I'm not really what that means, but yeah, we hang all of our licenses there and, you know, we all collaborate. I mean, it's more than just, you know, there's a relationship there.
EndUser: So, but I don't know, you calling them unless you're coming at them from a discount perspective and for them to then reach out to their unbrove, all those, like, hey, you know. [ORG-3] was normally charging 714.
EndUser: Here's our beautiful features, click throughs, click the dial, all that stuff.
Agent: We're getting Are you guys a [ORG-4] shop or a rocket?
EndUser: The... We prefer [ORG-4] at our company.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And I'm just thinking from Like if I were we're going to take the angle of trying to get the broker to license you guys or, you know, get a broader conversation going across all of the LOs at [GPE-3] home loans.
EndUser: On
Agent: We do have a pretty affordable price point through a partner that created sort of a mortgage processing system on top of [ORG-1] CRM pretty unique. It's.
Agent: Came out [DATE-5], but is now in general release and has been since [DATE-6]. Probably haven't heard about it, but figured if you guys are a [ORG-4] shop, it might be a good fit.
EndUser: The right side. So. So we see. You say the, yeah, because we're kind of self-directing on our processing, meaning like our broker doesn't direct us to one particular company or another. We select that ourselves.
EndUser: When you say processing, what does that mean in your world?
Agent: I understand there's a loan processor, loan officer.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So I think I said loan management system.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Okay. Yeah, no, I mean, that's fine. But no, like I said, we have as a company, like, again, everyone's designed differently or [GPE-3] home loans. You might have some guy that is [GPE-4] home loans or whatever.
EndUser: We all operate under our own [ORG-2], but we hang our license under a broker.
Agent: Okay, got you.
EndUser: Which is nationwide loans, which you may already talk to some of the individuals there and you don't even know about it.
Agent: Yeah, I'm looking them up right now. See if there's a good chance it's nationwide loans.
EndUser: Yeah, they're located in [GPE-5].
Agent: I'm going to see if they're customary real quick. My guess is, is they probably are.
EndUser: Yeah, and again, it's not. I said, we talk and all that, but we do our compliance and things that we have to do to be LOs.
EndUser: But, and with them, I said, it's like they manage the relationships with their wholesale lender, you know, the lenders, and there's so much that they do for us.
EndUser: And I said, I don't know, they don't direct us a processing tool, so to speak. And I think everyone operates around [PRODUCT-1] if you're calling on loan-offs already.
Agent: Yeah, I see what you're saying.
EndUser: If you're calling on loan-offs already, I imagine you're already kind of drumming up the business, you know.
Agent: Yeah. A lot of it's.
EndUser: I just don't think it's a huge opportunity for you.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I don't want you to spend your while.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: Unless you're coming with a <inaudible> discount, then I might be interested because go give us a discount.
Agent: We can your word for it.
Agent: Do you have a sales force like as it stands [DATE-7]?
EndUser: But I don't know that piece of it too.
EndUser: Because I think you guys are about 11 or a bucks a year, right?
EndUser: For kind of the basic stuff. We'll see her in with a click, click the call and you get so many minutes.
Agent: Yeah, that's right.
EndUser: And yeah.
Agent: That is correct.
EndUser: Or have you guys.
EndUser: Have you guys inflated that?
EndUser: I'm not sure. Right.
Agent: Depends what type of license you wanted to go with for a Professional edition license. Our list price is going to be something like [MONEY-1] for [DATE-8].
Agent: And that would include, you know, the features that you've been talking about. So, the Enterprise license though.
Agent: It's a totally different price point, but I don't know if that would necessarily fit with, you know, it'd probably be a little bit overkill.
Agent: So you don't have a sales force, like you don't have a license with us right now, right?
Agent: But you did in the past?
EndUser: I did. I let it. I didn't renew it. Yeah, it's been [DATE-9] probably, I guess.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I think you're probably the second.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You might be the second or third person calling on me.
Agent: I'm probably the same person that's called on you three times.
EndUser: No, I know we've talked a few times, but I, I, I used to fear.
Agent: Oh, we do have like an SDR team that probably calls you to.
EndUser: And I, you know, many conversations, right?
EndUser: Not just use it on taking personal, but, but, but I feel like I talked to this one cat that had some [NORP-1] at one time. So that could be you.
EndUser: But yeah, I'm not ready to, you know, you know, unload them though, if that makes sense. So that's, you know, the short and sweet of it, you know.
Agent: Yeah, no, that's a whole point of me giving you a call. I just had a meeting on the calendar for us in [DATE-10] and wanted to check if...
EndUser: Yeah, no, I appreciate I like what you do because I do the same thing.
Agent: Gotcha. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're here. Um... If you want me to give you a call
EndUser: I mean, yeah, I mean, another quarter, I think [DATE-11] is probably prudent for you and what you do.
Agent: Sometime before [DATE-11], we do have some.
EndUser: Let's see how this market turns and if I'm just you know, I'm a cold calling machine again and all that good fun stuff, you know
Agent: There's, there's a, you know, I would put it out for [DATE-11]. We do have an org change that's coming up where people like myself, I'm.
Agent: Currently, the SMB account executive, I can talk to people that have one person at their business to about 48 people at their business.
EndUser: Mm-hmm
Agent: They're gonna change that requirement where folks that don't reach a certain employee account can't have a dedicated account executive with [ORG-1]. You have to just buy a list through the website.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: That's happening in [DATE-11]. So if you did want to get a discounted Professional edition license, Now is the time because I cannot promise anything beyond [DATE-3].
EndUser: That's No, I can appreciate that. So if you wanted to, like I said, put me on in the [DATE-3], we're going to have another conversation.
Agent: Cool. Yeah, I'll give you a quick ring towards [DATE-11].
EndUser: All right.
Agent: Makes sense at that point. Then we can spin up a quick contract for you prior to all the work changes on our side.
EndUser: Yeah, so yeah, give me a buzz and I'll let you know my business going. If that's something that you know, I'd like to add to it or not. But yeah, I appreciate the call.
Agent: Cool, great. I'll put you down.

Agent: I'll take this to my team on my side And then when we reconnect we can bring our pieces back together and we can see what we can get done for you

Agent: No, absolutely. That's also good to know. I have to say selfishly, it's so much fun to know we're working with a team of women too, let alone women who are educated buyers.
EndUser: I
EndUser: Know, you know, I love that idea too, but I also hate that I love that idea.
EndUser: And do you know what I mean by that?
EndUser: I mean, I hate that we even have to think that way that you stay.
Agent: Talk about it, totally.
EndUser: You know what I mean?
EndUser: You know that.
Agent: Absolutely. And I just get so excited when I know like I'm talking self-force with someone who knows how to talk self-force. And then knowing it's women doing it, it's just, it makes it really fun.
Agent: But I agree with you that we shouldn't have to even talk about it like it's a rarity.
EndUser: I know. I know. I know. I love it. And for that reason, I don't like it.
EndUser: And I won't tell you how many decades ago that my best friend said, hey, you want to join the national organization of women?
EndUser: And that was a long, long time ago.
EndUser: And I looked at her and I said, no, isn't that going to perpetuate the differences?
EndUser: And that was my thinking back then. Now, nothing's changed.
Agent: Right. [DATE-11], well, I like to think you get a little bit better every time.
EndUser: In terms of,
EndUser: Well, you know, I think at least it's part of the conversation, you know, I mean, [DATE-14], women were trying to dress like men and be men.
EndUser: At least we're being who we are now and it's part of the conversation. But, you know, the unconscious bias is unfortunately well and alive, but you are working for a fantastic culture. And so, congratulations.
Agent: Thank you. Yeah, it was important to me to find a company where I felt like I had equal opportunity and equal support. And I only got even more lucky that my direct leadership is female.
Agent: So I'm glad that you see that and it's fun to be here.
EndUser: That's awesome.
Agent: Yeah, I have started typing my email to the team to get you a new rate. So I'm going to run after that so that hopefully you have it in time for your [PERSON-2] meeting. Wish me luck.
EndUser: I wish you luck, but I don't think it's going to be essential because I'm going to leave it as a bookmark.
EndUser: And, you know, the conversation I need to get confirmation on is, my vision to bring in the Implementation team, does it make sense now or is it premature?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And how premature is it?
EndUser: Are we talking [DATE-11] or are we talking [DATE-19]?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: No, I think that makes sense.
EndUser: So.
Agent: And obviously, you know, we've talked about this and especially with the discounting to I don't want to encourage any shelf where.
Agent: But the juggle is how do we not encourage self, self where, but we do encourage like an increase rate of savings. So it's kind of landing in that middle. Or like landing where it makes the most sense.
Agent: And I think that When they do hear your vision and they do, and you kind of get more clarity on the timeline, we'll be able to put something together that is the most responsible investment.
EndUser: Yes. That's a well chosen good word.
Agent: Well, because I don't want to shut up, [GPE-2], right?
Agent: Shofu just means that you're not using the right thing, and I didn't do my job to do the right thing.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah. And we just got our budget approved by the board.
Agent: Oh yeah.
EndUser: And by budget, I don't mean just spending, I mean, the entire everything.
Agent: Oh wow.
EndUser: And so. We are excited to work towards that and what the goals are with that particular board. So.
Agent: That is exciting.
EndUser: Enough said. Thank you for your call.
Agent: Wait before you hang up, I have good news.
EndUser: I'm sorry. Uh huh.
Agent: I'm starting to wreck you, but didn't want to lose you. So when we say [DATE-6].
Agent: For the shelfware?
Agent: Is that when you're expecting these licenses to be used?
Agent: [DATE-6]?
EndUser: I'm going to do a better job after I have the conversation [DATE-1].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I'm giving you [GPE-1] windage and if I say [DATE-6], it's an estimate of [GPE-1] windage.
Agent: Okay. Okay, great. So what I did, what I have on my end Messaging for quick approvals is if we push the licenses to go active on [DATE-17].
Agent: And I guess regardless of what you find out, this is consistent. The furthest I can push them out is [DATE-17].
Agent: Then if they Go Live then, and then you're not using them to march, that means they are shelves for [DATE-14], but [DATE-14], which is better than an extended period of time.
Agent: But I'll see what else I can work out.
EndUser: Okay, great. Thanks, [GPE-3].
Agent: Awesome, well [PERSON-4], thank you so much for your time. I'm so sorry you woke up so early.
EndUser: Thanks for your to appreciate it very much.

EndUser: Yeah, exactly.
EndUser: Are you a golfer?
Agent: I am just absolutely trash. I'm short game horrible.
Agent: Can I drive the absolute out of the golf ball?
Agent: I am an absolute. I can smack the ball.
Agent: But short game, anything with chipping, anything with that mid range, that was the same thing with an opposite of basketball, right?

EndUser: My brothers are all baseball players. Can drive [QUANTITY-1], can't chip [QUANTITY-2] to save their lives.

Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Had like [QUANTITY-3] left, grabbed a log wedge and it should just be you know right be able to put it right in the center and I think he I think he moved it like he scooped it got more grass than anything else and I think it went [QUANTITY-4].
Agent: Oh, yeah.
EndUser: And he grabbed his clubs and just swung and threw them and it's like, hey, maybe you ought to work on that form. Your clubs went further than your ball.

Agent: Really?
EndUser: But you put an iron in my hand, you'll probably have six in down to my 61 degree. I'm going to put it [QUANTITY-2] from the hole.
Agent: Yeah, all right fair enough.
EndUser: I played in tournaments with the [ORG-9], the CIOs, the friend of mine. He was a baseball player, crushes the ball. Again, can't chip [QUANTITY-2] to save his life.
EndUser: So we would go play in the [ORG-10] tournaments. And I mean, other than the fact that we felt good about our score and not lying. We never wanted to turn this into a nice competition.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, it goes just at that sport that you just keep on coming back and you keep on trying to do it, right?
Agent: Like, in this.
EndUser: One shot is all it takes to bring you back.
EndUser: You can have, you should 85, but you hit that one drive that when exactly where you wanted to go did exactly what you wanted to do, and that will bring you back.

Agent: [PERSON-15], yeah, with. Yeah, as [PERSON-15] at the squirrel, it's the same one I just sent to the other one.
EndUser: Yeah that works
Agent: So I know I'll follow up if you don't. Yeah. Um, I'll,
Agent: I'll fall Backup if there's something I didn't think that now or you can get it, but yeah, the PTA one I would like to set as well.

EndUser: That'd be awesome. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Yeah, and looking for [DATE-15], I think we're prepared for what the partners want, so that's going to be...
EndUser: You're breaking up, be there.
Agent: Yeah, did you send that list over?
EndUser: I will send you an email with their... I'm working on getting their emails in there, but I will send it to you.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: You're just in [TIME-3].
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, this has been, if you talk to [PERSON-4], he's been trying to push this on nature for a while before I even came around.
Agent: Um, just because of what you guys do in your industry for law, like law, and like, you have so much stuff that needs to interact. He actually monitored.
Agent: And so you don't have to, you know, it's a while [LOC-1] in there.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: You don't want people stealing stuff, right?
Agent: You don't want people taking stuff in the middle.
Agent: Dumping, going somewhere else and taking whatever, contacts, cases, information, it's some scary stuff that you guys work in, especially with like, you know, I even set up like, you know, apply their social Security numbers in this system.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: There's quite a lot of stuff that needs to be protected and tracked. They're really a no-brainer. So, you know, I think it's a lot of stuff that needs to be protected and tracked.
EndUser: Well, yeah, I mean, I come from the So my background in [DATE-13], I spent at [ORG-13], as a contractor at [ORG-13], and it's
Agent: Oh.
EndUser: It's a totally different one. There's the gift card, by the way. Thank you.
Agent: You got it?
EndUser: Yep. It's a major [DATE-9] difference with how the world works on the commercial side versus
[ORG-18] or government. There's a reason why the government slows because you have to check every box.
Agent: Well, I mean, thank God, right?
Agent: Right?
Agent: Thank God we are doing that. Like, no, hopefully, but yeah, we're not moving that quick.
EndUser: Hopefully.
Agent: Like, you know what I mean?
Agent: At least we're kind of going to slower process here and not doing it that quick. Because again, like, there's so much stuff that's on there. And those in those services.
EndUser: But at the same time, it doesn't need to be that slow either.
Agent: But they also, yeah, remember, those people don't make money like a business world. They make their for what the pension like we hear all the time. I'm here for the pension I'm here.
Agent: I'm not gonna work any faster than I
EndUser: Yeah, that was always my biggest complaint is that, yeah, we need to hire better people. People aren't just looking to be here because of that, but they actually have a skill to actually benefit us from.
Agent: Right But
Agent: Some people have been in there forever and also I mean, you know what an idea I used to sell to the government sector for software. And so I used to hear that all the time about it.
Agent: You know, like that, I mean, these guys have been here for [DATE-13], [DATE-18], they just dragged their feet. And it's like, that's kind of like this.
EndUser: Yeah, that's the way it is.
Agent: No. That is it.
EndUser: And it's never going to change.
Agent: Right. Well, I'm glad that you got everything. You got both cars, you got [ORG-15].
Agent: I'll circle back with you and then just, yeah, let me know and I can add those to people, no rush on that at all. We got time for that to that date.
Agent: And then let me know if you need anything else from yours, from my side for you to, again, there's other areas to help your business.
Agent: I know that right now we're just hoping for this, but if you want to think up after when this is done.
Agent: And just so that we're aligned on what you guys are, your vision is what you need long term.
EndUser: Well, I think it's going to help just kind of sit down and go over kind of what you can offer because I've been out of the [ORG-1] world for a while.
EndUser: But even when I was in the [ORG-1] world, it wasn't my vein. I worked with someone on the team who that was their responsibility and I could talk high level.
EndUser: I'd like to be a little bit more understanding of the products that you have and how they work. That would be beneficial to me.
Agent: Yeah, almost like an audit, right?
Agent: For us to look at your stuff, come through, let's clean out the closet, so you're going to let the outlets is going out.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Like again, like for example. [ORG-22] and [PERSON-4] had interest in our [PRODUCT-2] that is coming out in [DATE-15], which is [DATE-22].
Agent: And we kind of showed that in a very like, forward, you know, focused statement like we couldn't show everything, but it's going to be released [DATE-22].
Agent: And so that is something that that would help your service, your intake, like summarizing like cases to lawyers from like when people call in or write onto like, you know, the chatbot of like what happened, I got in the car accident, I need help.
Agent: That type of process, like really streamlining your kind of like your lead intake and then other areas of your business. You know the [PRODUCT-2] is extremely powerful and that's really going to be going live soon.
Agent: So there's areas that I know that you haven't seen but you've quite heard that we have this functionality now.
EndUser: Yeah, more just heard.
Agent: So yeah we'll see. We'll definitely think up. Maybe go grab a bite to eat. I get up and bokeh. So we can go grab a bite to eat, meet up with [PERSON-9]. You guys go play golf.
Agent: I don't even want to play with you because I'm going to embarrass myself in a no, I think you'll go to the trust me. But I'll be the cat.
EndUser: Teach you how to chip.
Agent: Yes, I'm going to be the cat. I'll be the cat.
EndUser: All Yeah, sounds good. Appreciate it. Looking forward to it.
Agent: Right. All right. Thank you, sir. Be a touch.

011580_167_0LQ3y00000ADonyGAD,"EndUser: What's up, man?
Agent: What's up KB?
Agent: How you feeling?
EndUser: I'm good, man. I'm good. Wait, I could.
Agent: Nothing much man hanging out.
Agent: You got a quick second?
EndUser: Yeah, man, I'm good.
EndUser: I'm just working in [ORG-1], you know?
EndUser: Doing my thing.
Agent: My man, you always repping the [ORG-1], man. I love it.
EndUser: I love [ORG-1]. I really do. I think I'd like to. If I could, I'd do everything I could in [ORG-1], but, you know, I can't always get my wish. Sometimes I gotta work outside of it.
Agent: I got you. What, that actually leads into my question. So, you know, obviously we work with [PERSON-1]. You guys are one of their dealers.
Agent: And so I guess my question is because I'm reaching out to other accounts that we have that are also dealers.
Agent: And what I'm just trying to figure out, if there was some information that you would like access to when it came to connecting with [PRODUCT-1], what type of information would be helpful for you.
EndUser: So let me just process that with, I actually work on the [ORG-2] side, so I don't touch the [PERSON-2] stuff.
Agent: God.
EndUser: That's our parent office that handles [PERSON-2], and I sure wish they would adopt [ORG-1], but they don't. But I could speak to it from a [ORG-2] perspective. Because we sell [ORG-3] and [ORG-2].
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Um. We have [ORG-1], [ORG-2] has [ORG-1], but the two systems do not meet, they do not mix, they do not touch, it doesn't work.
EndUser: So they have a lot of really cool stuff that our sales reps are required to use, but it creates double work because they have a tool built on experience cloud called building And they like bill they build out there or quote in order.
EndUser: I'm sorry It's called quote in order and they'll build out a deal on on [ORG-2] corporate sales force It'll generate a quote for them. It's somewhat clunky, but I mean, it'll get better.
EndUser: And then what they have to do with that is they have to print it out or email it to our finance department here, and then they'll have to create a new deal in my [ORG-1] because the two systems don't talk.
EndUser: So if I were getting all my wishes, I would say I would love an Integration between nonprofits, [ORG-1], and our [ORG-1].
EndUser: For the simple fact that our guys could go to one spot and create a deal there instead of two separate places.
Agent: So, okay, so Integration in Bobcat Salesforce so that I can create create deal in one spot. And then it automatically updates on the [ORG-2] side and finance side and they can handle their business from there.
EndUser: Right, yeah. And I mean, there's probably like an email parser or something I can plug in, but every deal is so different.
EndUser: It really makes a challenge to make sure that like an email parser or something like that is doable.
EndUser: There's probably, you know, there's probably some way that we could do it, but it would cost us at the dealer level way too much money to make that happen.
Agent: Interesting.
EndUser: So your guys are going to want to sell me mule soft, which is $[MONEY-1] a year. I don't have [NORP-1] money. So, and then there's access to APIs, but I don't have developer level skills.
EndUser: So then we have to pay developers and then we don't have the developer money to pay for that.
EndUser: So some way that we connect the two systems to where my guys are creating a quote at the [ORG-2] levels, and then it goes into my system, or [ORG-2] can give me access to just certain pieces that I can plug into my system.
Agent: Okay, now you said okay, so you're on the [ORG-2] side. This is actually still you know very useful helpful information and what you just said is actually exactly what I know what I needed.
Agent: So I'm assuming obviously this would be the number one type of mind thing for you. But you said that the [PERSON-3] side of the business that is [ORG-4] is a total separate area.
EndUser: Correct. Yep.
Agent: Okay now, do they, and so they don't use [ORG-1] at all the [PERSON-2] side.
EndUser: No, they don't. So this is where, you know, this is the rub with me. They want a [PRODUCT-2], but they don't want to pay for it.
EndUser: So they're trying to build a ghetto <inaudible> one in like, I don't know, whatever system they're trying to use. So it likely won't work out the way they want it to, because they could just buy extra salesforce licenses.
EndUser: But there's just a rub in the old, So that's the kamatsu side like the old way, the old way of doing business, pen, paper, they sell their deals are large, large deals.
EndUser: So [PRODUCT-2] and like the [ORG-1] mindset, you know, [ORG-1] kind of does like a lot more, like it's a lot easier to track volume.
EndUser: Our heavy side will do, you know one deal that's like a [MONEY-2] deal and like that's it you know they don't their guys don't need to like get a new business and follow up on leaves uh... as much as our [PERSON-4] guy if would they be valued sales force [PERCENT-1] they would it would it would help them out immensely and i could configure it for them they just they haven't yet decided they want to spend the money to add the licenses
Agent: So on that side, they probably might want to lean more towards like a service.
EndUser: So there's a rub there.
Agent: Learn.
EndUser: I was on Service Cloud. They have invested in a product called [ORG-5], and I don't know, it's getting a new name, they're rebranding it.
EndUser: But it's basically the business system, and it'd be amazing if they would be able to spend the money to integrate it with [ORG-1], but it doesn't have the APIs that we need to make it mesh with [ORG-1]. So.
EndUser: A lot of our service guys, they only want to stay in [ORG-5]. And the reason being is the same thing I just told you, they don't want to work in two systems.
EndUser: But we can't, where we're at now, we can't make the [ORG-5] system go away. It's a necessary part of our business.
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: And so the service guys don't want to play in two systems.
Agent: So we need to get a little total as a whole on sales force. So everyone just works seamlessly together. And point.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, that'd be great, but I don't
Agent: Who would I need to speak to on the [PRODUCT-3] side?
EndUser: Know. I don't
Agent: Yeah. OK, I'll do my.
EndUser: Know. I mean, you can, I mean, your gatekeeper is going to be [PERSON-5], who's the, who was the guy who, he's our IT director. And he, he's the one who stood up [ORG-1]. But I mean good luck
Agent: I appreciate it bro. Okay.
EndUser: Well, It's not the like the thing is It's just it's like trying to move mountains with with the heavy side. They're really they've been doing business for this way for like Oh, I don't know forever.
EndUser: They own [GPE-1] like There's really not there's no driver for them to change the way they do business because they They have like [PERCENT-2] market share in [GPE-1], so they don't really need, they're not really looking for a lot of change, right?
Agent: Mm-hmm
EndUser: They know what works for them and it's worked forever, so they're not interested in changing unless it's gonna make them a <inaudible> ton more money.
Agent: And one quote unquote deal for them is already [MONEY-3].
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, for sure. They, yeah, they, that it would be, if you could figure out how maybe [ORG-4], how the [ORG-4] side uses [ORG-1], that might be a good way to pitch it to our heavy side.
EndUser: There just has to be a hell of a lot of value, right?
EndUser: Because we're pretty far removed from corporate or from our headquarters.
EndUser: But the [ORG-4] side sits right with... [PERSON-6], so he knows what it takes to sell a [ORG-6], right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: He knows everything there is to know about selling [ORG-6], and there's no way it's going to change his mind.
EndUser: The only thing that's going to change his mind is if you can come in there and prove to him that by switching to [ORG-1], he's on the heavy side is going to make [QUANTITY-1] of money.
EndUser: So if you can find, you know, if [ORG-4] can prove it or you can find another use case of a [ORG-4] dealer who uses [ORG-1], that would be your way in.
Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: But I can't, we just use it differently.
EndUser: There's no way for me to prove to him how it works well for us because the volume of calls that his guys are doing is maybe not what our guys are doing. They're not.
EndUser: They're not going to get a lead for $[MONEY-4] mower, right?
EndUser: That's a mower that make $[MONEY-5] on it. That doesn't mean anything to those guys. They make a deal and it may carry them through [DATE-1]. And these are deals that are the customers that have been shopping.
EndUser: They know a lot, they trust a lot. They've been using a lot for since they were babies.
Agent: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay Five, three.
EndUser: I mean, I'm not trying to be like the bearer of bad news, I've been here for [DATE-2] and I mean, on set, that was kind of my goal was to get them to buy up on it and they went [PRODUCT-2] but they don't want to spend for it.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: So I'm hoping that my instance of [ORG-1] here is really going to prove itself in [DATE-3] here that we're doing a lot better than we did [DATE-4].
EndUser: And if that happens, then it'd be a lot easier to sell. So if you can't find the case studies in the next.
EndUser: You know, [DATE-5], maybe you wait till [DATE-6], we prove that we actually have some stability.
EndUser: The guys are actually selling a lot better than they did [DATE-4] or [DATE-7], then it's a much easier sell to get to MOCC because it's like, oh, I hope [ORG-3] making [DATE-8] of money.
EndUser: No, I think maybe we can afford it, you know, or it's worth it. But right now, right now they haven't seen the results because it's taken, you know, it's taken [DATE-9] to get the system right.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: To get people to buy in, to get everybody who's, to get them to stop thinking that it's a babysitting system or a big brother system and it's actually trying to help them win business.
Agent: Right, right. Okay. Man, that's exactly what I need to hear though, man. So you're definitely not the bearer of bad news. You're giving me just kind of like a framework. And I appreciate that.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure we're not the only company that's like, this is the way we've done it forever and this is the way we're going to keep doing it because We don't have a reason to change.
EndUser: Everything's good.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I will thank you and I know [PERSON-7] set up some [DATE-10] meetings for us.
EndUser: You're welcome. Yeah,
Agent: I'll probably see you in those.
EndUser: That's good. I like that. That'll work for me. I had to break his heart. The math quote was too much for us right now, but maybe later on in [DATE-8] we'll get math.
EndUser: What is it?
EndUser: Math advance is what we need.
Agent: Yeah, do we have a. I'm trying to see when that [DATE-10] meeting is.

Agent: Do you know it?
Agent: Oh, OK. [DATE-17]. Yeah, yeah. So our next one's on [DATE-13].
EndUser: Yeah. So we'll see how [DATE-17] ends up and then we'll see how [DATE-17] ends up and then we'll probably hopefully we'll be in better spots to make those kind of decisions.

009116_167_0LQ3y000009YG2MGAW,"Agent: Before we get into, so can you tell me your department name again?
Agent: Sorry.
EndUser: I'm working at [ORG-1], [ORG-2].
Agent: Okay, awesome. You're a PC, nice. Okay. Awesome. So my name is [PERSON-1]. I have the federal government. I cover the federal government. So I talked to you a lot of your colleagues around the federal government.
Agent: So this is perfect. In terms of financial data, if you want examples, how. Customer government employees are using [PERSON-2] for financial data. There is a very useful website called [ORG-3].
Agent: You heard about [PERSON-2] Public?
EndUser: I think I have just a second. I'm just going to make it so taboo public.
Agent: Yes, it's a resource where a lot of [PERSON-2] users have been able to post their dashboards and data. A lot of them are going to be based on government employee and government organizations and agencies.
Agent: I can try to find resources for you and send them over your ways that you're looking for. And then maybe see if that works for you.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: So [PERSON-3], you're saying that you currently have [PERSON-2] licenses.
EndUser: I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Like, well, I know for sure we're using it because they're using it in HR and I just came back here.
EndUser: [DATE-1], I recall they purchased like, I just like, I don't know the details because I wasn't involved, you know, what they bought, but I know they bought.
EndUser: I'm pretty sure they bought licenses and they've been using it ever since.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: It's just that we haven't really been using it for finance. They, I mean, they created some drafts, but, uh, but our, there's some desire on the behalf of our chief financial officer now to.
EndUser: Dashboards and so that's why they brought me back to do that.
Agent: Oh, excellent. Oh, perfect. I want to talk to a lot of people. across, you know, fellow governments, they do quite a tableau.
Agent: I think they like the power of it, the ability to connect to, you know, different types of data. They like the usability of it and sharing dashboards. I think it's a little easier than the power of the eye.
EndUser: Yeah. Well, our guys just using the use [PRODUCT-1] basically tabulate things in [PRODUCT-1], then they cut and paste the tables into [ORG-4] and do some narrative. So it's, yeah.
Agent: Yeah, that's not really, I mean, there's a way to do it, but that's definitely harder for sure.
EndUser: Well, yeah. It's what they were, we used to do [DATE-2] to go.
EndUser: So I just, my thought when you talk to me initially is why I think it's made me more modern tools [DATE-3]. I certainly, last place I worked, we weren't doing that. We'd leave to other products.
Agent: Yes, I'm looking at the [ORG-5] account and I do see there are some licenses for [PERSON-2].
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I'm not, from my end, I don't have permission to see who's using the licenses, but I do see that.
EndUser: Yeah. Well, it's probably the data analytics team.
Agent: Have you?
EndUser: They're the ones that produce, they produce all the reports. So I would go through them and they would create the dashboards for me. But I would be, my job is to tell them what dashboards to create.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: That makes any sense.
Agent: So I'm not sure if you know how kind of [PERSON-2] works, but there is an opportunity to have different type of licenses.
Agent: So if you're going to be kind of what's called a power user, you have the creative license so you can have full access to it.
Agent: But if you're going to be the viewer of dashboards, there's also the viewer licenses. So, you know, different ways to develop the team, because not everyone needs a full access to [PERSON-2].
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Not everyone knows how to use [PERSON-2]. But if you're asking for dashboards from the team, but you do want to see it and look around with it, then there are different licenses for yourself.
EndUser: Okay. I can ask them what this is because if I talk to my contact to data analytics, they probably tell me exactly what license they have.
Agent: Oh, that's our question.
EndUser: I know they have licenses because I know I know they see how I bought them, I think, [DATE-4]. I don't know about [PERSON-4], but so at least say [DATE-5].
Agent: Right, right.
EndUser: So we've been using ever since. I mean, he likes the products. So to me, they look good. So it's just a question of building the right dashboard in for financial management.
Agent: Right, and would you be using a tablet to create?
EndUser: I don't know whether I would use it. I think I'd like to know more like I guess for me, I'm always an inquisitive type of person. I haven't used it, but I'm open to using it. Yes.
Agent: Okay, well, I think that's a good question to ask. What we can do is, we have our [PERSON-2] lead for the federal government. He works with, you know, everybody from [ORG-6].
Agent: I know we recently from a call to the [ORG-6] team in the finance department is also using [PERSON-2], I think more for ships financing.
Agent: So, but he'll have like way more understanding of what the use cases across the federal government. And he will understand more the finance, but I'm going to call with our [ORG-7] finance recently. They're also using it.
Agent: So if you want to, yeah, there's quite a bit of a few [ORG-8], a lot of research teams [ORG-8] use [PERSON-2].
EndUser: Okay, I see MP as well.
Agent: So I don't have full details of that, but my colleague can delete on [PERSON-2] for the federal government will have that.
Agent: I'm just wondering if you want to set up a call, [TIME-1] call, just a little more about [PERSON-2] and then, you know, maybe ways that you can either let them blow.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Sure, I can give him a call, what he can call me, one of the two.
Agent: Yeah, we can set up a virtual, because probably the easiest way to do it.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Do you have my email address?
Agent: So I have a [ORG-9] on in front of me.
EndUser: Yeah. You could send me something through [ORG-9] and then I can.
Agent: Okay, I'll use your [ORG-9] then. So,
EndUser: And then I can. I do have a PC email address obviously, but I can I can sort of forward that and then I'll respond back through PCO.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay, so I have [PERSON-5] at jingle.com.
EndUser: Yeah. And if he can give me contacts, like who he's working with in [ORG-6] or [ORG-10], that might be useful, because I can call over there and see if I can get some examples of what they've done.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So what I can do is I have his calendar open right now. So feel open. We can try to set something up right now.
EndUser: Okay. Okay. Thank you. So far. [DATE-6] maybe or [DATE-7] [TIME-2] on the screen.
Agent: Yeah, [DATE-7] [TIME-2] at [TIME-3] Yeah, for sure. That sounds good.
EndUser: Yeah, I could. Yeah, if you want us to name and invite, I can do that.
Agent: Okay, so I will say top low, so [ORG-11], PCOS, sorry. Tombo PCO.
Agent: Okay, so I'm going to add your team over here.
EndUser: Okay,
Agent: Let me just add this just in case sometimes my emails go to spam folder. So I just want to make sure that you actually get this. Perfect.
EndUser: I'll check.
Agent: And then, okay, so let me just add a quick description here.
Agent: Okay, sending over now.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: So this is probably a [TIME-4] this [ORG-12] time to make sure that is correct, [ORG-12] time. Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, [ORG-15]. Yeah, because we're not, we're in auto.
Agent: Okay, awesome. Yeah, we have some team members in [GPE-1] and then some in [GPE-2]. I'm in [GPE-2].
EndUser: Oh, yeah, we're the same time zones.
Agent: Yeah, okay, that's excellent. And then what I'll do is I'll send you some materials on [PERSON-2] before the meeting.
EndUser: Okay, that would be great.
Agent: I I'll send you some stuff related to finance much so I can find.
EndUser: Okay. Yeah, because that's our idea is to do that.
EndUser: And I mean, I'm always interested in more about [PERSON-2] too, because I think it's, I think my personal view is you're going to see more departments cannot use like [PERSON-2] or other products to do this kind of work.
EndUser: But sometimes it's, it's.
Agent: Yeah, no, absolutely.
EndUser: It's just change management, right?
EndUser: People used to using other products, and they know other products. Yeah. OK.
Agent: Exactly. Exactly. And yeah, I think you know, you know, [PERSON-6] and the team there, that's something meeting invite. They're very well versed. They've been talking to the federal government for a very long time, [DATE-8].
Agent: So they understand how to make sure that change manager does happen.
Agent: Okay, excellent.

Agent: Happy [DATE-2] and how's the new house?
EndUser: Going?
EndUser: It's going, man. I'm still trying to sell my old house that goes for sale [DATE-3]. So my weekends have been spent getting that in order. And it's just been crazy times.
Agent: Yeah, I feel like this is this, like [DATE-4] is flying by way quicker than normal.
EndUser: Yeah, for sure.
Agent: I just wanted to call you super quick, I'm falling out of the blue, but I know you have been super busy, so I just feel like it would be easier because you were out for [DATE-5] with the house.
Agent: Just to catch you up super, super briefly. So we have like long story short, two conversations going on, and I wanted to kind of get your input on both of them.
Agent: One is the [ORG-2] and [PRODUCT-1] integration that we had discussed with you guys.
Agent: I know like what you and I had chatted about, you know, [DATE-6] was like the move to [ORG-3] and like the brokerage [PRODUCT-1] that's custom built for that plus [NORP-1] for integration.
Agent: Wasn't sure, I haven't heard that much from the team, so wasn't sure if you had chatted with them about that internally.
EndUser: Yeah, as far as the [ORG-3] discussion, that's way, way on the back burner.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So.
Agent: So that was going to say we can always talk about like the demo and the stuff that we showed you was [ORG-4] for integrating [ORG-2] and [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: However, we can still just do, we kind of put the [ORG-3] transformation on pause again, and we can just discuss the [ORG-5] solution to integrate [ORG-6] with. CRM.
EndUser: Yeah, so we're. I need to schedule some time and catch up with [ORG-7] and a couple of people on his team.
EndUser: Basically, my goal for [DATE-7] is to try and get at least approval to research and look into integration between [ORG-1] and [PERSON-4].
EndUser: So as of right now... You know, the innovation challenge team, they did their presentation and sort of laid out a suggested plan of steps to take moving forward.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So, you know, they took third place and as part of that, you know, we sort of make a commitment as a company to explore it more and move forward with some of these ideas. So, um...
EndUser: It's something I need to, so where we run into a kind of disconnect is senior leadership to, you know, my level in getting like approvals and things like that.
EndUser: So my goal is to work on getting the proper approvals. That way I'm not just spinning my wheels and looking into things that.
EndUser: At [DATE-8] will get shut down based on cost or need or what have you.
EndUser: So my plan for [DATE-9] is to get with the IT department, get with Taroja, come up with a plan to put in front of senior leadership, include integration points and with the [ORG-8] and [ORG-1] and making sure that all flows properly.
Agent: Okay, cool. And in terms of, because as we mentioned on the last call with [PERSON-5],
Agent: Between the time that you guys spoke with us [DATE-10] and now, like, basically what they have launched is a completely, we acquired a new company for automation and have built it in with the new soft offerings.
Agent: And what [PERSON-6] presented you guys [DATE-10] would be a different. solution than we would recommend [DATE-11]. And I know I've touched on that.
Agent: I just want to make sure to like drive that nail as many times as I can. what you guys are trying to accomplish.
EndUser: What's the company that you guys acquired?
Agent: It's an [ORG-9] company. It's for automation. I can't remember off the top of my head. I can look it up and get it back to you.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: But, long story short, if we're not even discussing the [ORG-10] play, it becomes a very simple conversation. [ORG-11] specifically [PERSON-7] to [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Integration is already pre-built and we can customize it a little bit for each, you know, unique instance, but it's already pre-built allowing for the two-way communication.
Agent: Like we could have that conversation present you guys, help you guys build a business case with, if we like connect with your teams and learn a little bit more around like how much time they're wasting all of that stuff.
Agent: We've done that for another client of mine. We can basically connect, help build out business case with numbers. for you guys to take back and present to the leadership team.
Agent: And we can get that up and running very quickly because it is something that we are doing with a lot of our big brokerage clients because we finally have that way to do it natively in-house now.
EndUser: Got it. No, that's good that you turn that around and that it's prebuilt.
EndUser: So, it could be, you know, one of our concerns and one of our issues is, We don't have a [ORG-1] sort of liaison, administrator type of person that understands the architecture and able to very easily modify the system to how we would want it.
EndUser: So one of our concerns and one of the reasons why we've leaned more towards like [PRODUCT-2], for example. is it's an [PERCENT-1] build-out system already and we're just have to modify [PERCENT-2] of it.
EndUser: So the lift is a lot lighter. Now, again, we haven't had gotten approval from senior leadership to move two formally go into the research of these systems, et cetera, et cetera.
EndUser: But, we will need something that's as easy as possible. If that makes sense.
Agent: And that's exactly what we've rolled out developed. I mean, I have, there's a really large brokerage. It's not one of my accounts, but it's been.
Agent: One of my teammate's territory and they basically, they simplified it because they, I think they were using applied epic, but they basically went to an evaluation and are going with, they're doing [ORG-3] plus meal soft integration, but you can do it with sales class as well.
Agent: But basically they're doing the whole [ORG-2] to CRM integration because they were so impressed how, Almost out of the box of this obviously you don't want something completely out of the box because everybody's head up is a little different But yeah, it's it's pretty it can be pretty ready to go pretty quickly
EndUser: Okay, that's good to know.
EndUser: So yeah, so I think again, you know, I don't know, every company works the same way. We're very slow to the gun to make the decisions.
EndUser: We are, I think we're more of a like get all your ducks in a row, line them up, figure it out, line them up again, figure it out before, you know, letting them march forward. So.
EndUser: That's what I'm doing now.
Agent: Well, and that's where I want to, I think we can really help you guys. I did it for, it wasn't around the integration tool, but I had a client that was looking to transform their like customer service.
Agent: And it was a very similar conversation where they're like, we've never, we don't really go through evaluations like this. And our managed, our senior leadership team basically needs to serve to them on the silver platter.
Agent: If it's ever going to get approved. So we did basically an hour long shadowing session.
Agent: Where we chatted with the frontline users to figure out how much time was being wasted with the current process, how on average, how much time are like what the [TIME-1] rate of, you know, for them it was a customer service route for you guys that could be an account manager.
Agent: And then basically put together one slide that we sent to the executive leadership team that said.
EndUser: Nice.
Agent: Based on our experience with other brokerages, similar to [PERSON-8], and based on the internal numbers that we have from your team, here's around how many hours you guys are wasting per month or per year, whatever it may be.
Agent: Here's what that comes out to in terms of monetary cost. Here's what we can deliver based on other successful implementations and integrations we have helped clients with.
EndUser: Yeah, and that's, so to me, that's sort of our research phase. So once all we're looking for is the green light to spend time on it.
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: So if I went to my boss, right, and I go.
EndUser: And he goes, hey, how's it going?
EndUser: I'm like, oh, just really busy.
EndUser: And he goes, oh, what's going on?
EndUser: And I said, I had a call with [ORG-1]. I'm researching the integration between [NORP-2] and [PERSON-4] and Tensei moving that direction for his company.
EndUser: He's going to be like, oh, well, where did you get that from?
EndUser: Who did major accounts initiate that?
EndUser: Did I see initiate that?
EndUser: It's like, no, it's like something that we want to do and move forward with it. It's like, well, until we get that approval to spend that time and research and allocate [TIME-2] to it,
EndUser: I can't just do that on my own.
EndUser: You know what I'm saying?
Agent: Yeah, for sure.
EndUser: I grab people from the service side and say, hey, I need just sit down with [ORG-1] for [TIME-3] or two and research this integration.
EndUser: They can evaluate our workflows and see how we can save time, that we're not even there yet.
EndUser: So what I'm doing is working with IT to get us to get the approval to move forward on a project like this.
Agent: Okay, cool. Let me know.
Agent: I spoke with a [PERSON-9] [DATE-9], so let me know if and when you chat with a [PERSON-9] about it, we can pop on a quick call and kind of lay out a rough, editable roadmap of like, when you guys get that go ahead, here's what we can do, here's where we want to meet or when we want to meet, here's how long Implementation would take all of that stuff.
Agent: So it's a little more firm case to get everybody, all the parties involved in on board.
EndUser: Yeah, definitely.
Agent: Cool. And then the other conversation, one quick aside is licensing. I know you said you probably would need like maybe two more before [DATE-9]. Any update on that.
EndUser: No, right now I am. I'm good with laces. I know that. I'm doing an evaluation right now. From [ORG-9] got our [DATE-14] invoice just once.
EndUser: You know, how many license we added throughout [DATE-18] so far, if we need any more. It really depends if we end up hiring two more.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Know that as of like [DATE-19], we had two that were in like second interviews, but I haven't heard anything since, which makes me feel like it could not happen.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But is there like, do you have any specials or anything going on or is it just kind of is what it is, having the license cost?
Agent: No, just adding something costs for like one or two off kind of deal.
Agent: It's just the basically the rate you have if you bundle together like because I, for example, like I'm working with another client and they basically they know of like three they have but based on their internal conversations they plan on hiring, you know, I think it's around like eight over [DATE-18].
Agent: So they're just going ahead and doing it like a bundle of 10 up front.
Agent: And basically, like when you bundle a higher volume, yeah, because it starts you four, I can get like a one off pricing discount approved or something like that.
EndUser: Yeah, we're not even. So right now we're actually, I have more licenses than I would like to have. Me.
Agent: And let me know. Go ahead, sorry. I thought you were done.
EndUser: No, just mainly because of we implemented that single sign on. So not only do we have producers, but any producers that hire. Administrative assistance, they have to have access as well. So.
Agent: Okay. Let me know, you and I, next time we have only a screen share, or it doesn't even have to be a screen share, just like a zoom call, I can pull up on my end.
Agent: I have like a system. It's basically built for sellers out of DRM analytics, which is [GPE-1].
Agent: But I have a dashboard where I can look at for each of my clients that shows like how many licenses they have, how many are assigned and how many are active.
Agent: Like with [ORG-9] percentage, which is logging in over like [DATE-18]. And we can look at that and make sure you guys are not having [QUANTITY-1] of software.
EndUser: Well, that, I mean, that's the problem that I have is, you know, I have, I have some producers that haven't logged into the system and [DATE-18], but I need them to have a license so that we can assign them to accounts.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So,
Agent: Well, we got to work on getting them adopted into it.
EndUser: Well, the one guy we celebrated is [DATE-18] birthday [DATE-18].
Agent: Oh my God.
EndUser: So, if you want to have a call with [PERSON-10], I would just say, [TIME-4] have like a firework or something loud and bright go off or else there'll be a sleep on the
Agent: I love that. Okay. He needs to retire like 71. I'd be on a boat or in a cabin.
EndUser: Listen the man is sharp too. You wouldn't you wouldn't believe it Yeah
Agent: I would imagine you have to be working in financial organizations over [DATE-17].
Agent: So the last thing I wanted to hit on just knock all three of these out real quick is the [ORG-14] conversation because there seemed to be a little confusion when you responded back on [DATE-18] for, I think it was [DATE-19].
EndUser: Yeah Yeah.
Agent: So we have not, I mean maybe like [DATE-18], [PERSON-11] spoke with [PERSON-9] about it. But we have not chatted with [PERSON-9] about Slack within [DATE-23] or two recently.
Agent: Basically what happened was is [PERSON-14] saw something on sales elevate, which is a feature of [ORG-14] that basically shows you your opportunity dashboard and like connects your [PRODUCT-1], so for [PRODUCT-1] to [ORG-14].
Agent: And he chatted with [PERSON-11] and is interested in getting it just for the team of producers at [ORG-18], not to like replace teams.
EndUser: So [PERSON-1], thestormator. [PERSON-1]. Okay, thank you very much Saw Yeah.
Agent: Because we even talked about that. Like we know you guys use teams and he said, yet we use teams and we're not really in a place. I started looking right now to get rid of teams.
Agent: But this is just more so I want to look at evaluate [ORG-14] with Sales Elevate.
Agent: To give to the producers to have better collaboration with them and save them on clicking and going back and forth between their chat app and [ORG-1] [PRODUCT-1] all the time.
EndUser: I get it, where my confusion comes about is as a Chief Security Officer.
EndUser: And what's confusing to me is why he would reach out to you guys about a product for a sales team without even talking to me first.
EndUser: So I need to connect with [PERSON-14] and figure out where his mindset is before you and I even talk about it further.
Agent: Cool, yeah, for sure.
Agent: No, it was basically, so one of our [ORG-19]'s had just reached out and sent information to [PERSON-14], and he responded to them that he wanted to chat about, he was interested in chatting about [ORG-14] and so the elevator, I don't know where he had seen it, unless it was just like some marketing collateral we sent.
Agent: But he confirmed what you're saying.
Agent: He said, you know, when we chatted with him, he said, definitely interested in talking further about it, but I want to consult with [PERSON-2] to go with you before we schedule anything because it would be under his perspective.
EndUser: Exactly. So that's what I need to connect with him because I honestly haven't connected with that and quite some time. So I need to just kind of see where he has had that.
EndUser: And then because, look, I'm just, I'm trying to get the producers to utilize the systems as much as possible and adding new systems before accomplishing that, just complicate it. So, I got to connect with him.
EndUser: I need to make sure that where his mindset is and then I need to learn about it. So, that's where I'll reach out to you to learn more about it based on my conversation with that.
Agent: Cool yeah, I mean, worse times the worst.
Agent: We would love to even [TIME-5] just show it to you because that is one of the things that we think would be valuable for you and [ORG-18], is it does push adoption of the tools you already are paying for with [ORG-1].
Agent: Because what I do is I stay in [ORG-14] and work in [ORG-14] most of [DATE-23].
Agent: And when I update my accounts or my opportunities, I do it right within [ORG-14] and it pushes to [ORG-1] and it's a two-way communication. So it makes it actually easier for me to use the tools that we have.
EndUser: Okay. All right, yeah, let me said [DATE-3] and I'll reach out to you and we'll get that overview set up Cool.
Agent: That sounds great. I appreciate it.
Agent: Are you back?
Agent: Are you back full time?
Agent: I know you said you're still working on selling the house. I don't know if that means I know you were taking some time off.
EndUser: No, no, I'm back I'm around
Agent: Okay, cool. Well, let me know when you chat with us and we can hit the ground running and then are just like hit the ground running on a conversation on the actual project.
Agent: And then let me know when you talk with a nail and if he wants to, you know, continue the conversation around integration.
EndUser: Totally.
Agent: All right. [PERSON-2], good catching up with you.
EndUser: Alright,
Agent: Glad everything's going well and I'll cross my fingers for filling the house.
EndUser: Yeah. Thanks, brother.

EndUser: [DATE-1] to [DATE-2], I joined the industry. And then [DATE-3], I should say, I started the admin process of getting all the softwares and individuals necessary to start my own company.
EndUser: Launch data somewhere around [DATE-4], end of [DATE-5], and have the admin. So it's taken care of and [DATE-4]. I should be able to take off. Now.
EndUser: I am using a [PRODUCT-1] currently that I have experienced with [DATE-6].
Agent: For over [DATE-7] and let's say we have some little well and so now let's ask [PERSON-1]
EndUser: There are some weaknesses with it on the processing side of things when it comes to actually processing the cases. But it's built very beautifully. It's very simple, easy to use on the still side of things.
EndUser: Now I did find a CRM for processing as industry that I like a lot more. However, they have zero sales component to it.
EndUser: So what I was looking to do is potentially kind of combine forces between [ORG-1], the sales ACRM, to basically serve the purpose of that current [PRODUCT-1] that I'm using on the sales side of things, but then have the processing done made completely separate [PRODUCT-1] system.
Agent: Difficult
Agent: Question.
Agent: I think that's the ultimate point board.
EndUser: I know that when I spoke to somebody, I thought it was [PERSON-2], they said that you actually deal with the individuals in this industry. So that's a little bit of my backstory and where we are now.
Agent: What is your future vision for your business?
EndUser: Say again.
Agent: What is your vision for the future of your business?
Agent: How can you feel for support that?
Agent: I don't know. You know, I feel like I think it was the future of the future.
EndUser: So there are multiple ways to go about this industry.
Agent: I'm here.
Agent: And I'm here intersectionalities, so finding your own means the future of your business is not our future because you don't know that it's all even one time it's fine, if you're ever seen erased reality as a long history that carrying [NORP-1] history of your business
EndUser: Darnies or the CPAs that. You know, kind of do solutions on the side and there is a niche resolution company.
EndUser: There's a view about out here and me myself, along with a couple other operate as a high volume sales company. So we'll have a very large sales floor call center style.
EndUser: Either Outreach or clients call in, they enter the system, then we begin to ask them a series of questions and collect some information, and then pitch our services at the sale on board a client, and then continue from there.
Agent: Thank you for your time.
EndUser: Now I know sales force, I've heard of you guys before. You guys seem like an industry giant when it comes to all sales related CRMs.
Agent: Let
EndUser: So I thought it'd be a good idea to give you guys a call just to understand a little bit more about you guys, how it works, what it looks like, etc.
Agent: Me see what's going on. Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much for sharing that. So we work with small businesses in the same way that we work with our Enterprise companies. The product offerings for our [PRODUCT-1] are the same.
Agent: We would recommend utilizing one [PRODUCT-1] at a time. So if you are looking to replace that, I can certainly help you.
Agent: But if you're looking to kind of combine [ORG-1] with another [PRODUCT-1], we wouldn't recommend that as a way to use our system.

EndUser: It's more for contact with the [ORG-2]. Percentage has its own calculations in the software for, you know, figuring out percentage predictability for different solutions.
EndUser: Now, if that's all something that can be mirrored in [ORG-1], we have beautiful all in one place. It'll be nice.
EndUser: But if not, if there's any kind of capability with CIFRIS to operate in the resolution and as we onion, if there is a complete replacement, that would be perfect.
EndUser: But does [PERSON-3] have that capability or is it mostly a [ORG-3], or is it customizable?
Agent: Yep, it's all customizable. We have a sales and service console. So, depending on the example you were to build out your solution and customize it yourself, you could determine that.
Agent: Have you taken a look at our information online?
EndUser: Not as a [GPE-1] as just basic information that i search through on your website But I thought I'd get in contact with somebody to get a little bit more in depth on the specifics for I know each industry is a little bit different.
Agent: Yeah, like I said, our products are not industry specific. You as the customer know you with a list. So really we recommend taking a look at what the products are.
Agent: And then if you have any specific questions about how you would, kind of envision the material working for your business, then we can absolutely help you in painting that picture and helping you to evaluate if you're priorities for [DATE-8] and what your main focus is would be a good fit for the for the [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: So I think, you know, if you're looking for a basic tool to manage your contacts and needs and opportunities and perhaps get some get a place for you to look at different cases that come in through a queue for your customers, then that seems like it could be a good fit.
Agent: I would recommend taking a look at our demos and seeing, hey, is this something that I could really envision myself using along with another piece of technology or is this too much right now?
Agent: Having, you know, sales force, that's going to give you 359 view of your customer. and depending on which edition you choose to go with, it can really be an all-encompassing resource.
Agent: So I definitely would take a look online at what that kind of entails and then going from there. No,
EndUser: Okay. All right. I'll do that. And if this line you called from your [GPE-2] line.
Agent: So the best way to reach me is by email. So I will reach out to you just giving you a little bit of an overview of what we discussed in the different products.
Agent: I think for right now, it sounds like our starter edition would be a good fit since it is a good way to start fast with sales service and email outreach.
Agent: If you're looking for a [PRODUCT-1] for sale, our Professional edition will give you forecasting management and some customizable reports and dashboards. and some basic quoting and contrasting capabilities.
Agent: You have a bit of availability to try for free all of these different editions. So if that's something that you're interested in, we can definitely help you to pass.
EndUser: Now, when you say, when you say, believe customizable, Could I have it very similarly to sales side of things of another [PRODUCT-1], to help you guys or what I have to set this up by myself?
EndUser: Or would I have like a dedicated team that would obviously the cost of these for having them down on board?
EndUser: Or how they really look on my end?
Agent: So how would look in your end would be you could set it up yourself or you could hire someone to do it for you, but we do not process any Implementation for our customers as a liability.
EndUser: Okay, and when it comes to integrations, do you guys have your own API or open API or the specific integrations with companies?
Agent: Yeah, that's a great question. So our APIs are included in the Enterprise edition, and that would come for $[MONEY-1] per user per month on our Professional edition. There are no APIs included with the starter edition.
EndUser: Okay. I have $[MONEY-2] per user.
Agent: So you're going to get all this information from me when we hang up. So there's no need for you to take any notes. I will get you on that if you are.
EndUser: All right, perfect.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: All right, I appreciate your time.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: Is there anything else I can answer for you [DATE-9]?
EndUser: That's it. Thank you very much.

Agent: Oh, man, I must have turned that up. Uh, let's see. There we go.
Agent: What are you guys trying to do?
Agent: Get me in trouble?
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Watch what you say. There we go.
EndUser: Did you get a full license?
Agent: Yeah, I sure did. I think you just auto records now though. Yeah, that's what that's what we want. We want it auto Recording so that you never have to ask for it again.
Agent: That way you can get the full content, drop it directly into like a canvas
EndUser: And have, you know, the [ORG-1] summarize it for you, man.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Einstein Conversations does that too with [ORG-2]. I just provisioned it to hopefully work with Zoom. So we'll find out. OK. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, it would be great if we started doing that. Let's fire through this really quick. Because apparently we've got a call coming up in [TIME-1].
Agent: Yeah. Still doesn't look like [PERSON-1]'s joining. But I guess we have some time ago.
EndUser: Who is T swan?
Agent: Oh gosh, did I wonder if [PERSON-2] just forwarded?
Agent: She's the part of
EndUser: Yeah, he found it. She just accepted it. So
Agent: That's fine. I've spoken with [PERSON-3]. Several times last I spoke with her. She just wanted to make sure that what she could do in part out she'll be able to replicate in Marketing cloud.
Agent: So we connected with our solutions engineer and everything seems good to go essentially. A long short.
EndUser: So here's my big concern about this call in [TIME-2]. If you're trying to back channel and just want to get kind of a take on it.
EndUser: The moment somebody else jumps on that call that doesn't, like, she doesn't report to [PERSON-2].
EndUser: She reports to [PERSON-4], right?
Agent: Yeah, she would fall under [PERSON-5].
EndUser: Yep, that is that's what's going to happen. She is going to be like, Oh, yeah, [PERSON-5], I talked to so on. So they were on the bill.
EndUser: So I'm trying to think of the best way to flex this so that it doesn't look like we're trying to go around her back. I might use this as a time.
EndUser: [PERSON-6], to just, did you really validate things like contacts, messages?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You validated that or just got to be an email through a bill.
Agent: Yeah. He validated, you know, how many contacts they'll have, how many messages. We reviewed it together. You said that it's fine. There's a look like there'll be even close to reaching their limits.
EndUser: No. No, I don't think they will. But my, I guess my big concern here, man, is how [PERSON-1] is going to take it. And we could be shooting ourselves in the foot.
EndUser: If she just jumps in, she could join. Like she might accept the call here in [TIME-3]. You don't know.
Agent: Yeah. That's what I was talking to [PERSON-2] on the phone with earlier. Tell him that like if you can get ahold of [PERSON-1], feel free two for the invite.
Agent: I just haven't been able to get ahold of her or respond by emails. I wonder why [PERSON-2] invited [PERSON-3] though. Maybe you're right. It's because [PERSON-3] falls under [PERSON-5].
EndUser: So did you validate with [PERSON-2] what we had talked about?
Agent: Specifically what?
EndUser: Well, you were going to ask him just point blank. Like you got praise, help me understand what the point is.
EndUser: Why would we buy two two two do the exact same thing?
Agent: I wanted this conversation to be about that.
EndUser: Yeah, that's going to be a dangerous conversation I have with somebody that was in the [PERSON-1]. Yeah, that's what I wanted to do for this
Agent: Conversation here.
EndUser: That's a conversation that just needs to be had one on one, not one on many, but it's coming up. So we'll need to have it anyway. And I think you just let me take it from here then.
EndUser: Let me just say, hey, [PERSON-2], [PERSON-3], I don't know, [PERSON-1]'s joining. But let me tell you where our heads at. I think we can make something work for you.
EndUser: I feel pretty confident that we can make something work around pricing. My biggest concern here, though, is that you'll have literally two two two do the exact same thing. And I want to make sure that nobody likes overpaying.
EndUser: Nobody likes justifying overpayments. So I want to get an idea on what your idea is.
EndUser: Is the Marketing thought a short-term fix?
EndUser: Would you end up moving everything to the Marketing thought over time?
EndUser: Help me understand what your long-term game plan is as we finalize our pricing. And just let them talk.
Agent: Yeah, and I mean, interestingly enough, so I connect to [PERSON-3] and some of the other part out users with [PERSON-7] [DATE-1].
Agent: And she never explicitly said this, but I can tell that she doesn't like braze either or wants to use braze.
Agent: Yeah, we just need to act. But we've got to get point blank with them at this point. It's [DATE-2]. We have to decide if they're going to move forward, but something in [DATE-3].
Agent: Yeah, I agree.
Agent: I think it's like, hey, where are we at?
Agent: Like what you said and then where are we at?
Agent: And do you guys want to get something done?
Agent: We need to use the fact that if [PERSON-5] isn't on, we need to get them selling us on Marketing cloud.
EndUser: Yeah, that's exactly what I want to do. I want to flip it so that they're selling me on why now and why I'm Marketing Cloud as opposed to us selling them on why I'm Marketing cloud.
EndUser: Why now?
Agent: Yeah, yeah. I do. Let me share this with you.
EndUser: I'm just shutting my door.
EndUser: My family is loud as <inaudible> right now. They've canceled school here [DATE-4], trash couldn't get out. We haven't gotten mail in [DATE-5].
Agent: We get [QUANTITY-1] of snow a year. We got eight overnight. You're kidding.
EndUser: Oh, and it does system. Yeah, and that happened back on [DATE-6] and [DATE-7]. So like grocery stores are closed. It's like an apocalypse out here. It's been pretty fun.
Agent: That does sound fun.
EndUser: And yeah, now we got another like two [QUANTITY-2] on the way. This is never happened. This is like a record first for [GPE-1].
Agent: We're in an [LOC-1] weather pattern. So that's typically what happens. Yeah. Pretty cool. I ping both of you. Just the deck that just has some general pricing information. I brought down the I'm in the zoom chat.
EndUser: Oh, I can't get zoom chat.
Agent: Let me just find.
Agent: So current.
EndUser: Currently they're Marketing Cloud engagement.
EndUser: Can you get the addition on here?
Agent: Yeah, it's what it's called database ultimate.
EndUser: So ultimate, which means they haven't upgraded in a while. That's a hot minute.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Why do we have the action center on here?
Agent: I just put it in there in case we want to talk through this personalization.
Agent: Something that I shared this a little while back, but they are, they have some [ORG-3] right now, like [DATE-8], like 49 K worth for core.
EndUser: Oh, <inaudible>. So if we sell them 37 K, it's zero.
Agent: If that's if that's how it works, I've heard in some cases, cross cloud, doesn't get impacted by [ORG-3].
Agent: That's what?
EndUser: Yeah, it would. I need you to get the slide that shows the difference between growth and corporate edition or whatever they are for personalization.
EndUser: Do you know where to find it?
EndUser: It's probably it's in like one of the personalization decks.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, look, the [PERSON-8]'s library.
EndUser: Um, as I'm looking at this, <inaudible>, I forgot about the [ORG-3].
Agent: Did in the first call deck.
EndUser: They have from your support right now for part.
Agent: I thought they didn't.
EndUser: You got it on here and for under the. Current.
Agent: That must be a mistype. Let me fix that.
EndUser: And they have 45,000 contacts.
Agent: You know, with, yeah, with them, let me. because theirs is a little different with the whole database. Let me double check that.
EndUser: When did they attract exactly [GPE-2]?
EndUser: You're on mute.
Agent: Sorry, I'd have to check, but I know it's [DATE-8] they dropped off some community users on their contract.
Agent: [DATE-9], right?
Agent: Not like this is [DATE-10] that'd be in our art, but this is [DATE-10] they actually a trip. Yeah.
Agent: Well, I mean, so something that could help us, if you guys don't mind me taking [TIME-1] on this call is they're <inaudible> idiots, honestly.
Agent: Like they are basically a welfare and they complain about Security all the time. And I'm like, you guys should have shield, you guys should have shield, you guys should have shield.
Agent: And so like if I was able to sell them shield, It would help us get out of the [ORG-3] on this piece just to like kind of get creative here.
Agent: Because that [ORG-4] would get us out of the [ORG-3] likely and then we could anything on top of that would be ACV. But yeah, we're in our [ORG-3].
EndUser: Okay. Okay. I mean, look, we can get.
EndUser: We can get <inaudible>. No, we can.
Agent: It's pretty dumb too. It's like, I mean, we shouldn't be impacted by this, but basically they renewed a long-term contract. They have been planning to a trip communities for like a year or more.
Agent: And instead of dropping communities at the end of their contract, they had other dates to drop it sooner to align with their renewal.
Agent: And so like, it's nothing that I did wrong, you know?
Agent: But I think we're still in the hole for it.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah. So you've got 103,000 contacts is what they've got to say.
Agent: Yeah, 103,000.
EndUser: Is there a reason we're selling them [FAC-1]?
Agent: You've got 76,000 additional contacts on here. Yeah, 99 additional contacts plus 50k contacts is 96. k contacts. contacts is what it comes with. So it'd be 170k. So let's bring that down to 88k. Personalization growth.
EndUser: And they're paying 29. OK, so basically what we're telling them is we're going to give them. And we don't have to bring this up on the call [DATE-10]. I don't think that we have to get into pricing.
EndUser: We can, or we can let them know that it's coming, and set up a time to review it [DATE-17]. Because what I don't want to do is blindside [PERSON-1].
EndUser: I do want to see you add a note.
EndUser: Well, yeah, I want to see you add a note that down at the bottom, let's get the terms and conditions down here. Of slide three terms and conditions, you can grab them from almost any side that we've got.
EndUser: And then I want another terms and conditions that says, you know, the price of [ORG-5] can be can go towards the upgrade of personalization when you're done with account engagement, something like that.
Agent: The ship. To. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Trying to find the terms and conditions on a slide somewhere.
EndUser: It should be on any of the pricing slides. Like no pricing slides should ever be sent out about it. Just make sure that you get that in there and might keep it for the future.
EndUser: You validated that Premier was going to cost about, what was that, 10K?
Agent: Just about.
EndUser: Sounds about right. I might make that just 96K to be safe. and make these discounts, like make them <inaudible> goofy as hell.
Agent: Like this. I know [DATE-17]. Yeah.
EndUser: Like that.
EndUser: Ok, I don't like I said, I don't know that we actually want to pitch this while we're on this call. Let me let me see where we go with this.
Agent: Did you add things like SAP in there and the right number of SSL certs, etc. Did you validate this with your I did. Yeah, this.
EndUser: So look, connect with your [PRODUCT-1] validate that you actually have everything in there for me. Because you need to make sure you've got those in there.
Agent: Copy that.
EndUser: You don't have to put them on this. Just to be super clear, slide three does not have to go into a deep dive breakdown of every skew that we've got in it.
EndUser: We're just going to want it to ultimately match up to these numbers. Talk to your [PRODUCT-1], validate that you've got the right excuse. We run the pricing on here so that we can get...
EndUser: An exact number and discount, make the discount scoop feel like I have on her right now. And then get something underneath here that says in [DATE-14], they can shift the part of spend to the upgrade of personalization.
Agent: How many [ORG-6] normally do clients need?
EndUser: Talk to your [PRODUCT-1]. I think it's four, but validate with them because it's changed a couple of times over the course of [DATE-18].
Agent: Yeah, I think it's four for one SAP.
EndUser: Yeah, I think so. But like I said, just pain.
EndUser: Who is it [PERSON-9]?
EndUser: No, who was on this one?
EndUser: [PERSON-9]?
EndUser: Oh, well,
Agent: This is [PERSON-7]. Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, [PERSON-7] said she's here and I got virile to tell her to keep [PERSON-7] on this one.
Agent: Yeah, she's been great.
EndUser: Okay. Um, set the conversation up. Thank you everybody for joining. Uh, and then just pass it to me for [DATE-17].
Agent: Yeah. Let me see if I could bill set me any notes regarding why he invited [PERSON-3].
EndUser: Well, I mean, if you told him to invite [PERSON-1], you probably picked the next best.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Um, [GPE-2], if you're, are you talking?
Agent: Sorry. I think [PERSON-10]'s obviously anti sales force and [PERSON-3] is probably pro. So let's just use this as a strategy session with our camp champions.
Agent: Yeah. I want to validate that she is a champion though first. Yeah. I don't think [PERSON-3] is necessarily a champion, honestly. She's open to it, but she definitely. feels good on part of that right now.
Agent: And I think she definitely has some hesitations about learning a new system. So I wouldn't call her a champion yet.
EndUser: Ok. Cool. Please fix these things. Let's delete all that stuff out of the appendix. I don't want to accidentally send it. Like delete appendix on. This only needs to be a three or four slide pricing deck.
EndUser: Go through and make those edits. When you do, when you're finished, [PERSON-6] just drop them in the slack. Let me take another look at it. I like where, I mean, I like where your head's at.
EndUser: You did a good job putting it together. We just need to make sure that we cross our teas and dot our eyes. The other thing is I'd like to see us throw in here a mutual clothes plan.
Agent: Oh, yeah. I have that. So like, these are what we know to be the steps.
Agent: Can we get this done by [DATE-17]?
EndUser: [GPE-2], you want to talk about shield?
EndUser: Have you already set that that conversation up with them?
Agent: It's a bit of a Hail Mary, but Yeah, I can bring it up at the end, but let's make this the priority.
EndUser: Okay. If So here's where my head's at. If we can fill the whole, which is such a weird thing to say, then it would be a 95k roughly ACV event.
Agent: So with the 49 [ORG-3] is still 95k?
Agent: Now with the 44 it would only be 21k. Okay. I'll still take it.
EndUser: I mean who wouldn't, right?
EndUser: But still. Okay.
Agent: That's all we got.
Agent: We've got to confirm like we've got to make him feel like we're running out of deal for him for [DATE-8], you know?
Agent: I don't know. Yeah, but I don't pressure that or no.
EndUser: We do. I want to validate that he can get that done though. And that's their time.
Agent: Is there a good slide or area I could find the differences between growth and corporate addition for personalization?
EndUser: Yeah, it's in the, you got to go find it in the in the first call deck.
Agent: Okay, the personalization first call deck.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Yes, I'll do it in 57 slides.
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: I find it. That's fine.
EndUser: Okay, cool.
Agent: Alright, thanks. You guys in [TIME-4].

010515_167_6qr3y000000g4LDAAY,"Speaker 5: Facebook messaging, basically digital engagement solves for everything except the [ORG-1] use case.
Speaker 5: And so ideally Twitter posts and DMs will come into [ORG-2] as a case in Service Cloud and then we can route those through [ORG-3] channel to [ORG-4].
Agent: I think, [PERSON-1], to answer your question too, and [PERSON-2], thank you. I know I wasn't on all the calls, but I think, like, there could be an expanded use case.
Agent: I think we need to validate that a little bit, but before we even explore that, we want to make sure, like, we want to understand, based on what we've received for information and how we want to present, okay, here's the solution to move forward.
Agent: This would solve. what they specifically asked for. I think it could open up an opportunity for.
Agent: A broader social solution like you described and I don't know if they have a tool in place that they're using for that right now.
Agent: I don't because candidly it wasn't really a big part of our scoping it's been much more so I'm not even sure we have the right people to inherently answer that question either right like it could be owned by someone else.
EndUser: Aligned to Service Cloud
Agent: We're primarily right now looking just to solve this one thing but as we go into our call with that next we could certainly see. what that looks like and see if that opportunity exists beyond that .
EndUser: Got it. OK, that's helpful.
EndUser: Is is on the channel part of Marketing cloud?
Speaker 5: No, it's just no service club.
EndUser: Ok, got it. So. Oh, yeah, I was going to say [PERSON-3]
Agent: Does use 19 sprout does use on the channel for the routing and I just spread. I'm put in the chat, some of the documentation on the integration.
Speaker 5: And that might kind
Agent: Of help clear up like how it actually physically works to pass a Twitter message and create a case.
Speaker 5: Yeah,
EndUser: I guess from our end in terms of helping you scope this to do you have you heard anything else on how many of the service crowd users would potentially need access to those social messages.
Agent: No, that's something that I think we need to get better understanding of. We do know that 19 of their users need chat functionality. That said, I'd be surprised if all of them needed that social media
EndUser: Aspect of it.
Speaker 5: How does that work place and why?
Speaker 5: Is it only based on if they need to log in to [ORG-5], or is they would only be accessing the cases from Service Cloud?
EndUser: We have a couple of ways that you could do it, but in [PERSON-4], you might want to jump in here too, but basically they could still live within a Service Cloud and they would have an iFrame for [ORG-6] within there without needing to jump over into [ORG-6] if they're primarily only using it for responding to those messages.
EndUser: So they would still be able to live within a Service Cloud in the iFrame, but they would have basically you'd be buying a [ORG-6] state for them to do that.
Agent: Yeah, they still, so the way the pricing works is they still have to purchase a sprout license for every user in Service Cloud that is physically going to be responding from social messages.
Speaker 5: Service Cloud to
Agent: You can buy additional licenses as well if there's, I think, and [PERSON-1], you might know the numbers on this better but there's like a read only license as well and that's going to be if you have someone who wants to see like.
Agent: Who wants to be at a read-only user in Service Cloud and see the social messages and maybe report on them, but they won't physically be responding.
Agent: And those are a little bit discounted because those folks still need technically a sprout license. But it's a different cost just since they're not physically responding.
EndUser: Yeah, it's actually so the. And to give you, I guess, some context on pricing, it would be $[MONEY-1] for the first Service Cloud user, any additional users, would be $[MONEY-2].
EndUser: And that's the same rate for the And that's [DATE-1] users.
Speaker 5: Reply only.
EndUser: Yes, that's a [DATE-1] cost.
EndUser: The other thing is that with [ORG-6], whenever we're rolling out [PRODUCT-1], Sprout users, we do require our own internal Implementation as well.
EndUser: So that's something where we probably need to do a technical scope and call with [ORG-7] on the Implementation side.
EndUser: Maybe with, I guess if you're fully doing their Service Cloud implementation, you'd probably be the best one two connect with for that. But if there's anyone else on their side, you would be.
Speaker 5: Kind of helping
EndUser: Drop, map that out internally. We'd want to meet with them so that our Implementation team
Speaker 5: Can make sure they're fully prepared
Agent: For that as well. OK. Is that included in the cost
EndUser: Or is that an additional fee?
EndUser: That's
EndUser: Additional. And again, it's going to depend on how many users we're talking about. If it's just a couple, it might be different then. All 14 of them.
EndUser: I'd want to verify with our Professional services team, just because I don't have enough information yet, exactly which peer implementation. And it kind of depends how much, [PERSON-2], you're taking on.
EndUser: If your organization sprout implementations before, all that would
Speaker 5: Has done kind of impact how much and how involved our team would need to be in that.
Speaker 5: Yeah, we have, but I'm pretty sure that most of the ones that we've done have just kind of been in supporting the Implementation team on the sprout side. Like we didn't we don't do anything inside of sprout.
Speaker 5: It's just making sure things are
EndUser: Mapped correctly testing. That kind of support. Okay. Yeah, that's typically how it looks. So that's awesome to hear you and been involved in those before.
EndUser: Yeah, it would kind of come down to also like how many taste routing different scenarios.
EndUser: Which again, our Implementation team would be the one two have most of those questions for you, but I know that can help push them
Speaker 5: On one tier or another up our implementation.
EndUser: Yeah, but for, I mean, for a range, if that's helpful for your pricing, you'd be looking at about 10 to 14k per year
Speaker 5: As a fee for implementation.
Agent: [PERSON-5], other questions?
Agent: I think maybe we just kind of need to regroup after this
Agent: And see what the best path is. Yeah, I mean, I think I think candidly, like 10 to 14k might be a deal breaker for us on this.
Agent: So like, I think if let us know what information you would need to like kind of finalize what that number could look like, because I think if let's just say they're only going to license.
Agent: Five people, that's like 3x what they're going to pay for licensing. I just, in addition to the Service Cloud implementation, I think that could be like, I think that could be pretty hard pill
Agent: For them to swallow. Are there any other that for.
Agent: Specific use case?
Speaker 5: We're trying to say they're social networks, just because [ORG-6] would be covering quite a lot.
Agent: Yeah, they also think that Exactly.
Speaker 5: They get a lot with that isn't a requirement that we've uncovered.
EndUser: Price. It just
Speaker 5: So it couldn't be valuable to them. But if we're just solving the [ORG-1] use case, it's a lot of money
Agent: To spend to have cases created off Twitter.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Yes, that's my
EndUser: Understood.
Agent: Yeah. Very
EndUser: Much understand. And also there's inherent value. Yeah, we like we wouldn't have a different price just for that specific use case where they'd be getting, you know, the availability to push like [PERSON-4] said messages from all of social.
Speaker 5: It wouldn't
EndUser: And
Speaker 5: Like I saw I believe they're on [ORG-8] as well. It looked like what's up. And all of that we have in digital engagement.
EndUser: It's literally just the [ORG-1] can't seem to make.
Speaker 5: That we
EndUser: Okay. And with digital engagement, that's where they're collecting those messages
Speaker 5: And pushing them to Service Cloud on your end. Yeah, digital engagement allows them to message one two one with customers in multiple
EndUser: Channels, but [ORG-1] is not a supported channel. I see. OK. Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, if there's anyone else to that would be helpful for us to reach out on their Marketing team, if there's other contacts on that end, who you haven't met with.
EndUser: Let me know, I'm happy to do so as sometimes that if it becomes more of a, that can open up more budget.
Speaker 5: You know, a wider department
EndUser: But yeah, happy to send over some more documentation on service crowd and sprouts in general.
Agent: And do a little more scoping on my own.
EndUser: I will
Agent: Yeah, and anything you have on like the Implementation piece would be super helpful.
Agent: Yeah. I have a question for you. So if they were to If they were to sign up for a trial, let's just say.
Agent: So let's say they don't want to commit yet and they were to sign up for a trial.
Agent: How does that work from an Implementation perspective?
Agent: Are they able to do anything with Service Cloud or is it more you're gonna get with a trial like functionality of Recording like that?
EndUser: Of social and things just wondering questions you might ask.
Agent: Like
EndUser: Yeah, and they could definitely do a trial, but that would give them flaxes into sprout. It wouldn't have any connection to Service Cloud because that's it
Agent: Set up by Implementation services. Okay, that's right.
EndUser: Yeah, anything else that I can make sure to send over your way or
EndUser: Anything else we can help support you with here?
Agent: I think I'm good. Maybe just, I know you mentioned just in [ORG-9] as well.
EndUser: The pricing move,
EndUser: And they just have implementation. Peace.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, we'll keep in the loop and let you know how the call goes
EndUser: And set up next steps. That's it. Yeah, sounds good. I know we can get you added into our [ORG-10] as well. It's easier to... to chat that way, [PERSON-6].
Agent: Are you haven't been added yet?
Agent: Is that correct?
EndUser: Ok, I don't think so. Yeah, we can.
Agent: I was going to say [PERSON-4] can probably add to you. Awesome. Well, thanks so much.
EndUser: I appreciate both
Agent: Your time.
Agent: Yeah, thank good one.
EndUser: You guys so much.

016512_167_0LQ3y000009gkROGAY,"EndUser: I'm good, but I didn't catch your first name.
Agent: Oh, sorry, probably [PERSON-1], that introduction. My name is [PERSON-2]. I'm calling from [ORG-1]. Sorry, I know the call is a little bit out of the blue.
Agent: Do you have [TIME-1]?
EndUser: Well, is it to talk about the software called [ORG-1] that you use as a CRM?
Agent: Yeah, you're clearly familiar with [ORG-1]. Yes, it is. We actually chatted as well [DATE-1] [DATE-2], I'm not sure if you recall our conversation. Okay.
EndUser: You know, I get a phone call from [ORG-1] probably five times a year.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I certainly understand what it can do and how it all works. And our guys just are not interested, not remotely interested. They don't think it's useful.
EndUser: And I don't want to buy something, pay for it, and then it never gets used. That's the dilemma I have.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, no completely fair and I think last time we spoke, you actually mentioned the exact same thing.
Agent: And really, I think we kind of, you know, touched race and you'd said that, hey, I mean, if no one's going to use it, then why take a look and why even explore conversations?
Agent: The reason I was reaching out was we actually caught an inbound lead from someone named [PERSON-3]. [PERSON-4], who I think also works with [PERSON-5].
Agent: Obviously since, you know, I'd spoken with you in the past and would had a warmer chat. I wanted to reach out to you and see if you work with him at all.
Agent: And, you know, if, or maybe we're aware as to why he was looking into sales force.
EndUser: Well, yes, about three questions there. So let me answer the first one. Yes, I know [PERSON-6]. He works with me here in the office. I don't know why he would have inquired.
EndUser: But if there's something, he hasn't brought it up to me.
Agent: Okay, okay.
EndUser: But I would make the decision if we did it, would sales force be interested in giving us the software for some period of time?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And if people like it, we pay for it. If they don't, we just give it back.
Agent: Yeah, I think what we would do sometimes do is we do kind of a trial. Also, another thing [PERSON-7] we do is during that, you know, discovery phase.
Agent: We always do make sure that we do, you know, demos, customized demos. And when that happens, obviously, I understand that you like [ORG-1] and the issue is really the reps using it.
Agent: We do talk with a lot of people who have the same issue, and we also sometimes recommend, like, reps sitting on that demo itself. So with the combination of those two things, we usually do see some success.
Agent: I'm not sure if that answers your question and that can help a decision there.
Agent: But what do you think?
EndUser: Well, we hired a guy that came from a company that they used [ORG-1]. And once he joined us, he didn't think it would be any value to us. So I thought, well, that's weird.
EndUser: This guy is [DATE-3]. He's a tech guy in our group and he's not that excited about it. So everybody else is older than he is. And our company has never had a [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Yeah, yeah.
EndUser: But I think we need one, I mean, on some level. but I don't want it to be not used.
EndUser: So even though I can pound my fist and get mad and fire people and get all goofy because they don't use it, what are you guys find when it comes to old timers trying Yeah.
Agent: Yeah, no, that's a great question. Honestly, [PERSON-7], I work in, or I guess I manage the territory, which is [GPE-1], [GPE-2], [GPE-3].
Agent: It's a lot of Manufacturing companies, a lot of architectural firms with employees who've spent their whole lives at the company. So adopting new technology is never easy.
Agent: But what we do tend to do is we don't offer the same product that our more tech savvy slash Enterprise accounts will be using. So we really even just introduced a more user-friendly line of products.
Agent: So it is a completely different interface. Same automation features, but it's the kind of software that's very easy and intuitive to use. So already there's kind of an interest in seeing how easy it is to use.
Agent: Then the fact that it's mobile first and the fact that they don't really have to spend a lot of time putting data into the software, we really work on getting buy-in from the rep. before we asked the company to spend any money on the product.
EndUser: So how do you get the data in there?
EndUser: I mean, does it somehow have the ability to go into our
EndUser: Enterprise software and get the data for everybody?
Agent: Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's one of the ways. I'm assuming you use an ERP. Okay, yeah, so we usually are actually, at always, we recommend integrating with your ERP.
Agent: It can be a one-way Integration or a two-way Integration depending on what real data you need in your [PRODUCT-1]. So that way you don't have to do any kind of double entry.
Agent: It just pulls data from the ERP into the [PRODUCT-1]. In terms of sales reps actually entering data into the [PRODUCT-1], the [PRODUCT-1] also connects to your email.
Agent: So sales reps can continue to work out of their email if they do already and they don't have to touch the [PRODUCT-1] at all. It just pulls information from the email.
Agent: And then lastly, if you know you want to record call notes and things like that, we do have, so for example, even this call with you, after this call, it'll just manually transcribe all my notes into the [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: So, no, I don't have to sit here and type any kind of information about my conversation with you or just does it for me.
EndUser: But if you're on a cell phone call, is it going to just basically dictate the entire call?
Agent: So,
Agent: Yeah, that's one of the ways to do it. Another way, let's say if it's not a cell phone call and your rep just has a meeting with a prospect.
EndUser: That's a lot.
Agent: Face to face. He can come back kind of press this one button on the [PRODUCT-1]. say I spoke with [PERSON-7]. [PERSON-7] is interested but worried about reps using it. And then it just all manually transcribes it.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, it makes sense.
Agent: If that makes sense. I know it's a lot of information.
EndUser: Our guys aren't our guys Yeah, I don't know how much I don't know what they're doing out there. I mean They're all very successful, but I don't know how they're doing it.
Agent: And I think that's the whole, yeah, last time we talked as well, you did mention, and I think that's the whole benefit of [PERSON-8] is, you know, exactly how successful your reps are and your less successful reps, like through the [PERSON-8] is how you're able to make your reps even more successful.
Agent: So, I mean, I think just given the fact that there has been. some interest from the company. I was very excited to see. So I really just wanted to reach out to you again.
Agent: We don't have to really, I think we don't have to make decisions in a hurried way, especially given that you want buy-in from the reps.
Agent: But even if you just want to start off those conversations, I can connect you to my colleagues.
EndUser: Well, let me just tell you the way it would work here. I don't have permission to do anything without IT looking at over saying good or no good.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So we have so much Security here. Even if I wanted it and IT said no, we're not getting it.
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: So what's your experience with the security?
EndUser: Element of it. And a hacking, a breach, a feeling of information.
Agent: Okay. I'm. Okay.
EndUser: We're a very, very private company, and we share nothing ever.
Agent: With sharing with.
EndUser: We don't, I don't like our people, I don't like anybody using [ORG-2].
Agent: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: If that's secure.
Agent: Okay. I'm going to be very honest with you. I don't have the answer to that.
EndUser: I love honesty. Love that. Yeah, I love honesty. Go ahead.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I trust you're honest all the time.
Agent: I am and I am and which is why I'm going to say I'm not.
EndUser: It always scares me when it always scares me when somebody makes a declaration of honesty.
Agent: Oh, well, you know, it's me processing a disappointing answer in that I don't have the answer in terms of, you know, how exactly we are secure.
Agent: I I'm not heard of a data breach from any of the customers that my territory and my team supports. But if you were to ask me how exactly we go about security, I don't have that answer.
EndUser: Yeah, Well, that's okay. I mean, if it's important, we'll get to that someday.
EndUser: But if it's, is everything stored in the cloud?
Agent: So [ORG-1] is a cloud like it's a cloud based software. Yes.
EndUser: Well, before we waste any more of your time or my time, let me talk to [PERSON-9].
EndUser: She's our director of IT, and I've asked that, hey, [PERSON-9], have you ever heard of [ORG-1]?
EndUser: And if yes, What, how do you feel about it with [ORG-3] compared to allowing that into our [PRODUCT-1]?
EndUser: Because there's a moat around our [PRODUCT-1], or I mean our ERP that it's big, nobody can get across it.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So important for us is that we don't have any cracks in the armor.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, no, it makes sense. Definitely makes sense.
EndUser: So one other question would be is how much does this cost?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: What does it cost?
Agent: Yeah, so I think, you know, just based on what you've told me so far, we would introduce that more user-friendly option kind of starts slow and then if you do kind of like it, obviously, you know, we can always introduce the more Enterprise additions.
Agent: At the moment, we are at the end of our fiscal year as well, which means between you and I, [PERSON-7], we get very creative with pricing.
Agent: So right now, even if what I share is something that doesn't make you too happy, we can always work with that. We've never lost a deal due to pricing in [DATE-4] and [DATE-5].
Agent: [DATE-6] is when [DATE-7] ends. So I think what makes the most sense for you guys is either pro suite or Professional edition.
Agent: So that's that ranges [MONEY-1] per user per month to [MONEY-2] per user per month. And then depending on the number of people you'd like using [ORG-1], we'd flesh out how much that would cost [DATE-8].
Agent: Plus if you guys that need any discounts, but... That also affects the contract value.
EndUser: To 106 and that's the simplest bike. Doesn't, you don't have to be a computer coder to use it.
Agent: Oh, no, absolutely. None of our additions require you guys. It's all drag and drop when you want to adjust dashboards, when you want to add new.
Agent: I guess just new data fields, everything is drag and drop within the [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: Does [ORG-1] offer a business expense?
EndUser: Format so you can put all your business expenses in there and turn them in.
Agent: Oh, I'm not.
EndUser: Travel expenses, meals, entertainment, golf balls,
Agent: Yeah, yeah, I don't so I actually reuse something for that and reuse all just all like me and as a [ORG-1] rep I use just all [ORG-1] products. I'm not sure what I use [DATE-9].
Agent: For travel expenses and if we're able to put that into our [PRODUCT-1], I'm going to make a note to check for you if that's okay, [PERSON-7].
EndUser: You don't have to ask permission from me to check it. No, you're good.
Agent: No, no, I'm just going to to make a note to ask my so [PERSON-10] is kind of my counterpart.
Agent: Who is that product expert?
Agent: So I'm just going to ask if we do have that module.
EndUser: Well, it's just I was just curious because I'm thinking of a little bit of automation would help. Right now, everybody has to mail their receipts in.
Agent: Ok. OK. Yeah. So if you guys could do it through the [ORG-4], then that could be nice.
EndUser: They could just take a picture, put their cell phone and put them in the thing. Then we could.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: You want to know what's better than a CRM when you want to see what your sales force is doing.
Agent: That's how we...
EndUser: This is the number one. Nobody knows this. But if you want, if you're interested as a manager to what your sales, Traveling sales group, outside sales is what I'm referring to, not inside, but outside sales force.
EndUser: Just keep an eye on their expense report because you can't lie about that.
Agent: Oh my gosh, that is so true.
EndUser: Can't lie. Can't make them up. Can't make up. Can't get receipts from things that don't exist. So if you're sleeping [DATE-10], you can't. That's the biggest truth detector on earth.
EndUser: Yeah, I'd it. So that's the only thing I care about is expense reports. That tells me what you're doing.
EndUser: All this other stuff you can, you can, you can, you can turn on the sunshine machine and fill that thing up and it looks great.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: You can fake everything else, but you can't fake expense reports.
Agent: That is so funny. Whoa, whoa,
EndUser: So that's why I asked about the expense report thing. Because really, outside of that, whoa, whoa.
Agent: Now that I know it's important, we'll see if we can see.
EndUser: If somebody's not doing their job, it's going to show up. And we're not a match. And that's how it goes.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: But we have an uncanny amount of employee retention, like you've never seen before.
Agent: Yeah. No, you did mention people have spent, yeah, and almost your whole lives.
EndUser: Years here.
Agent: Right, yeah, yeah. No, it makes sense.
EndUser: You got a guy that's [DATE-11] right now.
Agent: And it's honestly a... Oh, wow.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah, no congrats and I think that's also that's very commendable.
EndUser: No, it's just it. So fortunately, we have the right people. That's what it comes down to. So when somebody asked if I'm interested in keeping track of what sales people are doing, and the answer is not really.
EndUser: Waste my time and if they're gonna blow, they're gonna turn on, I call it the sunshine machine to make everything look bright and nice. No. I don't want any device that would allow them to do that.
Agent: No, it makes sense. It makes sense. Hey, I mean, if there is, [PERSON-7], you know, I mean, we did have this conversation again.
Agent: If you do, I know you're supposed to have the chat but [PERSON-9], and if you guys do decide that we're curious to see what it looks like, we're curious to see if, you know, what happens when reps see what those first looks like as well.
Agent: You let me know. I'd love to schedule that quick intro call. We can always go from there, but yeah, I'll obviously leave it up to you.
Agent: Does it make sense for me to reach out after you have that chat, but [PERSON-9], what do you think should be next steps for me?
EndUser: Well, I use the word call me back, but you use the word reach out. That's fine. Yeah.
Agent: Okay, okay, no, I'll call you back.
EndUser: You can call me back.
Agent: What time, sorry, what day makes sense for me to give you a ring?
EndUser: Okay, Uh, let me see [PERSON-9] here [DATE-9]. I'm looking at the parking lot. Yeah, she's here.
Agent: Great.
EndUser: Why don't you ring me and I'll see I'm going to be gone [DATE-13]. So it would have to be [DATE-16].
Agent: Okay. Yeah, I can do that. I can. I'll send something over. You don't have to join. It'll just be a reminder for us to connect.
Agent: Are you back on [DATE-11]?
Agent: Okay, awesome. So I'll just give you a call then. We can see if there's any need to set up a longer chat with...
Agent: I was mentioning I'd want to bring [PERSON-10] into the conversation as well because I would say whenever we're having these conversations where... reps have never used a [PRODUCT-1] before, but he's had these conversations in the past and he's seen success as well.
Agent: So he comes to mind and we can continue conversations with him if it makes sense after the second.
Agent: Does that sound okay?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I'll talk to [PERSON-9].
Agent: Okay. Awesome, [PERSON-7]. Thank you so much. I really do appreciate you taking this call. Thank you for the chat. And yeah, I hope things go well with [PERSON-9]. Let me know if there's any other questions.
Agent: But no, until then, happy holidays.
EndUser: Yeah, you too. Yeah.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Oh, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll visit with you after [DATE-11].
Agent: Okay. Take it.
Agent: Perfect. Perfect, [PERSON-7]. You'll see that placeholder.

012449_167_0LQ3y000009NvyyGAC,"EndUser: Yes, this is he.
Agent: It's [PERSON-1] with [PERSON-2]. I think you spoke with my sales development rep here [TIME-1].
EndUser: Oh Oh yeah, hey, I don't appreciate you calling me. Yeah, if you're free now, we could just knock this out and say we're some time [DATE-1].
Agent: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. If that works for you, I at least wanted to get in front of what the [PERSON-3] put in the notes about you not being able to access your trial.
EndUser: Yeah, that's a bit of a, that's a bit of an inconvenience. I kind of being tech savvy myself. I kind of have a thinking suspicion.
EndUser: I said, what's going on?
EndUser: But if you could help me resolve that, that would be great.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And otherwise, then we could, we could still talk terms and everything else as well as far as conversation.
Agent: Yeah. I don't think it's, I don't see it on my end. So I guess it's not active. Usually, sometimes the activation email will go to your spam folder.
Agent: Did you double check there?
EndUser: Okay, so maybe something is stupid. It's okay. Got it.
EndUser: Yeah, so like I have it like the physical software was running on machine, but basically there's something I have to activate still right there was my inbox without your saying. Yeah,
Agent: Exactly. Yeah, you'll get a separate email with like activation link and you just have to click on that verify blah and you'll be clear and good to go.
Agent: Sometimes it does end up in the spam folder because I think it's got, you know, a bunch of links in it. So, well, email spam.
EndUser: So yeah, and we're like. Yeah, [PERSON-1], we're like full like stealth startup load right now. So any chance you can put that to my personal email address as well.
EndUser: Otherwise, I'll I can take it out if you don't have that kind of control. Probably not.
Agent: Yeah, which email address is the trial supposed to be under?
EndUser: So.
Agent: Because the B... ...for...
EndUser: I read I registered everything. I registered everything into the company name. So I think that's probably where it went to our I see I email address.
Agent: I gotcha.
EndUser: Assume is where I want to the bus.
Agent: Yeah, I don't have a way to push it to another email address.
EndUser: My personal.
Agent: So you have to look for it through the... Whichever email address you use to sign up for it, it's where it will be.
EndUser: No worries, I can do that.
Agent: Yeah, just give it a shot.
EndUser: I can do that.
Agent: If it's not in your spam folder, let me know. And I can get a case with... customer support and escalate it and make sure somebody's on top of it.
EndUser: No, I bet you, I bet that explanation makes all the sense of the world for me.
Agent: I
EndUser: I definitely didn't act. I definitely did an action [PERSON-2] email after doing the initial registration. I was just able to download the software and it clearly says I have [DATE-2] until it until it expires.
Agent: Gotcha. I gotcha.
EndUser: Well, Okay, got it. So once I see that, that should actually give me a customer portal. Link to [ORG-1], which point that I can actually be able to do what I need to do.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, it should walk you through everything once you grab that activation email and you should be good if not. This is my work sell. You can text or call your
EndUser: Got it. I appreciate that.
Agent: Yeah, but anything I can help to provide for [DATE-1]'s meeting, I'll let you get that squared away [DATE-3] and I'm free the rest of the afternoon. Besides the [TIME-2] meeting.
EndUser: Yeah, [PERSON-1], so yeah, without divulging too much, I'm super familiar with [ORG-2] and [PERSON-2]. You know, I use it outside of my small venture here that we're discussing [DATE-3].
EndUser: So [PERSON-4] basically pushed to me because he thought that there may be some opportunity where again, super small startup mode. So I don't know, like I see the rate card on the website.
EndUser: My only challenge with that is that I've got two other business partners that conceptually aren't going to do any of the coding or development work, but it would be nice for them to see some of the visuals.
Agent: Great.
EndUser: I don't know if it's like so how does that work if I only have one viewer license right like they literally would not be able to see the dashboards is that my thinking about it the right way.
Agent: Oh, sure.
Agent: Oh, well. Yeah, so every deployment will have a creator license, which is like the alpha and omega of the data that suit is the connecting builds out the [ORG-3] access, etc.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: And then, yeah, if you want some other folks to send dashboards and reports to, that would just be a viewer license on top of that, which is [DATE-4].
EndUser: So just help me understand.
EndUser: So again, conceptually, ultimately, what we'd want to do is be able to, you know, pitch the consulting solutions, right?
EndUser: So like the dash works kind of like the front end to the analytics that the group does.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: So like how does that work on road shows?
EndUser: I guess it doesn't matter.
EndUser: Like the end person I'm pitching to doesn't need that doesn't need a viewer license because it's my hands on the keyboard, right?
EndUser: So I would just authenticate in.
EndUser: So one of your licenses is satisfactory, right?
Agent: Yeah, if you're doing it in person, nobody's going to stop you from... Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, correct. I'm doing a person over teams or something like that's fine as I guess my hands on the keyboard.
EndUser: If they want to be able to hit the URL themselves and resolve it, that's what we need to be relationships for, right?
Agent: Yes, to be with an asterisk. So we do have kind of two separate ways to go about it. The regular [PERSON-2] licensing is all internal, requires a multi-factor authentication for security, et cetera, et cetera.
Agent: There are some alternative licensing called our embedded platform.
Agent: Functionality [PERCENT-1] the same, but it skits that multi factor and you could, you could send somebody access to their data and they get interact with it, ask questions, ask you stuff.
Agent: Definitely build a conversation more than just a static diagram.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, I think that I think that all comes later. Like we're like we're here for concept though right now. So like me, I just have to make a decision from a from a visualization front then.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: So like, you know, power BI or you guys essentially.
Agent: Yeah, exactly. And just forgetting started [PERSON-2] is definitely going to be a lot easier. It's a no code environment unlike [ORG-4].
EndUser: Yeah, I'm very familiar with both and platforms. So all good all good in that regard.
Agent: Gotcha.
EndUser: Okay, so I guess we're just going to prove a concept mock-up so I have to suck it up and you guys extra bucks or you can throw me extra viewer license, that'd be great. And that was awesome there.
Agent: Yeah, we're definitely doing some new customer incentives for discounting into [PERSON-5], so we'll get you the best price we can.
Agent: Once we figure out the you know your license needs but it sounds like a crater and a couple of viewers to start and then you can always add swap upgrade anytime you're not set in stone with your contract Yeah, I got it.
EndUser: I'm like thinking the right way. Like I'm seeing like, like the rate it looks like it's like $1091 brand new.
EndUser: Is that the right rate to be expecting here?
EndUser: Yes. You have some flexibility there.
EndUser: Or can you lose that?
EndUser: I said, but we'll need some geo licenses with my first point.
Agent: No, yeah, no, we're just counting. We're just counting [PERCENT-2] right now on the handful of licenses and I can touch up with [DATE-5] billing.
Agent: Compared to the web store where you'd have to buy it all up front, but I could I could do some extra discounting and set you up on a [DATE-5]. That's helpful for your venture.
EndUser: That would be helpful if we could chunk it out a little bit. And like I said, just, yeah, <inaudible> in [PERCENT-3]. I guess offsets the fewer licenses which are the way we can work that out.
EndUser: All right, so do you want to hammer those details out [DATE-1] at 12?
EndUser: Is that better for you?
EndUser: Or we can try to like just take care of this right now?
Agent: Yeah i mean i work for me uh... so i can't if you if you want to be set up on [DATE-5] there's one caveat because of the just internal ds there's a like a minimum transaction value so i have to have a credit card on file it wouldn't be authorized or paid until you sign a [GPE-1] sign for the agreement but for me to set it up on [DATE-5] that i've got a card on file but i could send you a draft quote to give you an idea of what uh... creator in [DATE-6] of the clock
EndUser: Yeah, if you don't mind doing that to me, like literally, and I feel you on [DATE-7].
EndUser: So I'm happy to get this closed out [DATE-3] or [DATE-1] But literally the company the company a car car to see like with the bank like pending being like generated So but I guess I could always like I'm just assuming like I can give you my personal like I always updated to the company card at [DATE-8] in time That should be a non-event right Right, but Sure.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that's just a matter of like it's billing at [ORG-5]. Need to change credit card or I could probably do it on my end. I haven't done that before.
EndUser: No, that's fine. I assume again that it's.
Agent: But.
EndUser: What happens close to so much is just such a polar universe shift for me from like working at a very large Enterprise scale, like a very small startup and scale.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So like usually I have like a procurement department and an account stable group that the hang with these types of nuances.
Agent: Yeah, for sure. Now, we'll definitely take care of you. And I feel that I left 15 person radio station selling environment before I came to. the Enterprise software world.
Agent: So it's been a big shock the other way for me.
EndUser: Okay, so yeah, I got no problem. Yeah, if you can, if you can, if you can give me some discount on the rate, like I don't need. But literally, I guess the creator comes with a viewer license.
EndUser: So conceptually, I just need two more viewer licenses. If it can make that look good.
Agent: Now the creator is just the creator license. You need to add a viewer.
EndUser: For some reason, I thought like whatever that $[MONEY-1] rate card basically gave you access to everything, but not.
Agent: So the creator has access to everything, but if you want someone else to interact with your dashboard, you need to add a viewer on. But I'll throw the [PERCENT-4] discount on all the licenses you need.
EndUser: Okay, yeah, thank you. I appreciate that. And then I guess we can.
Agent: It's just a matter of which email has access to what. So like the creator would have access to all the creator functionality.
Agent: If you want [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-7] to have access to view stuff, they would each need a license.
EndUser: Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I think that's the right answer here. So also really because otherwise, [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-7] can't see <inaudible>, and I just have to take them screenshots and show them the multi ones.
Agent: Look at that.
Agent: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you can fit a static like PDF to anybody, but for them to interact with it, it just eats up time on the cloud environment. But yeah, no sweat. We can ask you not more [DATE-1].
Agent: I'll send you a couple of resources as well. And a draft quote over so you have an idea of the numbers.
EndUser: Yeah, personally, if you send it in [DATE-3], I'll huddle with the guys that we can just hammer it all out [DATE-1]. That works for me.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Purpose.
Agent: Yeah, you're not.
EndUser: All right, and I appreciate it. And me, so I appreciate you reaching out. I'll go and activate everything in the intro. If you want to see me, I would like.
Agent: Yeah, for sure. If you run in any trouble getting the trial activated, let me know and I'll escalate a customer service for you.
EndUser: No, it sounds like I literally just missed an email. I need to click a link on. So it sounds easy enough.
Agent: Yeah, let's hope so. Never know though. But all right.
EndUser: All right.
Agent: Appreciate you.
EndUser: Thanks, man. I appreciate your time.
Agent: Yep.
EndUser: Have a good day.

Agent: Yeah, no absolutely. Yeah, we I know that [LOC-1], he meets regularly. I think he meets on a [DATE-1] basis with [PERSON-1].
EndUser: He may. Yeah.
Agent: Yeah, he definitely he's on a he's on a very frequent basis with her. But we do a part yeah, not trying to bypass our traditional points of contact here.
EndUser: That's exactly where I'm going.
Agent: But no, I could I could tell you know, I do hear that a lot, you know, if you know people that if you already have contacts here, why reach out to me.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: As a salesperson, I would love to get your point of view and gain understanding directly from you about your size of the business, maybe any challenges.
Agent: And that way, we can better communicate to people like [PERSON-1], what's going on directly from other business units. And, of course, you work with [PERSON-1], but it would be great to give you a point of contact.
EndUser: Okay. Yeah.
Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm still confused about a couple things. The phone number that comes up from you is [GPE-1].
Agent: Yeah, we do use [GPE-2] numbers. It's cheaper to call from [GPE-2] and from [GPE-3], but I'm happy to send you an email as well.
EndUser: Ok. OK, got it. And that just happens to be the area code of my phone as well.
Agent: Oh,
EndUser: So you've come up as spam for me.
Agent: Oh, really?
Agent: Oh, that's good to know.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: That's a.
EndUser: And so the other thing is, yes, we are only, you know, [DATE-2] worth into [GPE-4] and we are a small [ORG-1] team.
EndUser: We are still busy with some of transitioning and [PERSON-1] has been and talks very frequently with sales management, obviously, part in their global sales management conferences that they did [DATE-3].
EndUser: And so I think [PERSON-1] is the person you should be talking to, not the rest of this on the team.
Agent: For sure. Okay, so you, I guess you report directly to [PERSON-1].
EndUser: Directly to [PERSON-1]. Yep.
Agent: Okay, got you. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense.
EndUser: And I think she would want to know what you're doing. She just happens to have left on vacation [DATE-4]. But that's how I'm coming at it.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
EndUser: I think [PERSON-1] should be the most involved. and at least know that you are reaching out to other people in our organization.
Agent: Oh, absolutely.
Agent: Yes, yeah, I know totally understand where you're coming from [PERSON-1]. Yeah, like I said, she's on a [DATE-1] basis with [PERSON-2]. I'm actually the [ORG-2] as part of the account team.
Agent: So I set up points of contact, just like this, right, and introduce people to the account team. Thank you. to show how we can help potentially and make your life easier.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: And also, you know, if anything, you'd have a point of contact as well.
Agent: So if there ever was anything that you needed, you know, I see that you're looking at data and [ORG-3], stuff like that, you know, I would be able to connect.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Yeah, I'm interested. I'm interested for sure.
Agent: Yeah, we would be able to.
EndUser: So I'm in no position yet to have really any feedback or input for you because we're just at the beginning of looking at things.
EndUser: So you have never spoken with [PERSON-1]?
Agent: I actually, I don't know [PERSON-1] directly, but [PERSON-2] is very familiar with her.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: I work very closely with [PERSON-2]. I work under him.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: But we do have a very strong relationship with her and she's aware that we are speaking to other people.
EndUser: She is.
Agent: Yes, absolutely. You can ask her about [PERSON-2].
EndUser: Because I'm surprised that she wouldn't have let us know.
Agent: Yeah, no, we're actively engaged in a number of different projects at [GPE-4].
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Okay. Right. Yeah.
Agent: Even though it's only a [DATE-5] company, I know everybody's heads down with the transition, the lock going on, and integration, stuff happening with from [ORG-4] in the transition.
Agent: But either way, I still think it would be a good contact for you to have even if it's not [PERSON-2] but [PERSON-3].
EndUser: Right.
Agent: She can help you even with the small things.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: And, you know, maybe help understand like what challenges your team is having directly.
Agent: And obviously that we can loop in, um, loose for these kind of things too, but would be great to get your [PRODUCT-1] on, um, you know, what your work, like the challenges that you see directly happening on your team.
EndUser: Yeah, I think I think the best idea if we want to talk about that is that [PERSON-1], myself, and [PERSON-4], not sure if you have her name. She also reports to [PERSON-1].
EndUser: I think the three of us should get a call together.
Agent: Okay, great idea. That I will actually, what I'll do is I'll talk to [PERSON-2].
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: I'll talk to [PERSON-2] and just curious before I go to him and before I let you go here.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Is there anything right now, like you said, you know, you're interested in data and AI?
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Like if I do set up a meeting between three of us and [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-1] as well, what would you like to learn?
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Are there any resources, you know, specifically?
Agent: Is there anything that you're trying to bridge the gap on or your team is focused on right now?
EndUser: Nothing yet.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, we are still being this small a team with almost 858 users. We are still just busy with day-to-day admin data stuff.
EndUser: Sadly, it feels like there is not time to explore all the fun things in the coming, trying new things.
EndUser: I know all three of us subscribe to various things like sales force, ban folks on force, where we see other articles and things that we maybe have expressed interest in.
EndUser: And we might read about them and then it kind of <inaudible> there until somebody comes to [PERSON-6] says we're interested in looking at this and then we might go down that road.
EndUser: So sadly, I know I feel terrible saying I don't have a point of view and I don't much to give you, but that is, and [DATE-6], [DATE-6] we lost our developer.
Agent: Yeah, it's totally understand.
EndUser: So we will also be scrambling when [PERSON-1] is back to get that replacement.
Agent: Hmm. I see.
EndUser: So that means more fun in games.
Agent: And [PERSON-1], I guess she's coming back from vacant like [DATE-7]. Okay.
EndUser: She'll be back at [DATE-8].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: She's just out for [DATE-9].
Agent: Yeah, okay, what I'll do, I appreciate the context there, by the way, yeah, and I know a lot of stuff is in the air right now.
EndUser: Sure. Yes.
Agent: You know, nobody has like a good grasp on like, you know, the check that direct challenges or that are happening.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: And yeah, thanks for referring me also to [PERSON-5] there. I see that she's, you know, focused on process improvement and specifically, you know, sales force efficiency. I think there could be a really good conversation for us there.
Agent: I'll talk to [PERSON-2] and.
EndUser: Yeah, please do.
Agent: I'll tell him that she's on [PERSON-1]'s on vacay and whether or not it would make sense, but I think you and [PERSON-5] could get a lot of value, although [PERSON-1] is very well connected with [PERSON-2] there.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: But yeah, that's great. If anything, what I'll do is Yeah, go ahead.
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: So did you send an email with your information?
Agent: Yes, I'll send over an email now.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: And yeah.
EndUser: I just include [PERSON-7] too, and I'll just let her know that I spoke to you briefly.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, well, what I can do is yeah, I'll send over that. And I can also just send over a placeholder for a chat, like maybe [DATE-10] or something like that.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, that's reasonable.
Agent: And we can get something on the calendar, but that sounds great.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: What times work for you?
Agent: Good morning, afternoons.
EndUser: [TIME-1] is best because [PERSON-1]'s in the [GPE-5] and [PERSON-7] and I are both in the [GPE-2].
Agent: Okay, mornings are best. Okay, so let me just look right now.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I'm looking at the calendar 9th. So for if we're looking at [DATE-9], [DATE-14], would [DATE-14] at 909 [DATE-14] at 9.
EndUser: I'd say too early. She'll have a bunch, she'll have a bunch of emails and stuff to get through.
Agent: Would [TIME-2] or [TIME-2] or.
EndUser: So I would say, you know, what I mean is how about [DATE-16], the 23st?
Agent: Okay, right because of [PERSON-1] there. Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, she has a ton always. Okay.
Agent: Okay, let's do that. What I'll do, yeah, I'll send over a placeholder. And in the meantime, what I'll do, [PERSON-8] is I'll send over an email to you and [PERSON-7] as well.
EndUser: Perfect.
Agent: Okay, sounds great, [PERSON-8].

009803_167_0LQ3y000009xNaLGAU,"Agent: So I think it was something. I mean, we're halfway there and I can't wait. But how [TIME-1] that was crazy.
Agent: The [PERSON-1] and [GPE-1] saying that was nuts, wasn't it?
Agent: Do you watch all that?
Agent: Aw.
EndUser: Right. I didn't watch it, but I read about it [TIME-2]. [DATE-1], I was pretty busy man.
EndUser: I managed a food bank here in the local area for veterans, so I had to meet the veteran who was in need.
EndUser: I get him some food, and then after that, I went to a charity community meeting for another organization I'm an officer for, and we go to an allocate funds, and then after that, I came home and I had to do homework, and yeah, it's just busy, busy nights.
Agent: How school going?
Agent: Yeah, that's awesome though. Thank you for serving.
Agent: Did you and I have about this already that I was the chairman for [ORG-1] here in [GPE-2], which serves our state?
EndUser: So,
Agent: I didn't know. I didn't know there were veterans specific food pantries. That's pretty awesome.
EndUser: Yes, so the way the 624C is set up is a 624C for a food pantry, you can specify that it's for veterans, but that means that you have the responsibility of ensuring that [PERCENT-1] of greater of all patients who come through that food pantry are veterans.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So, it means that we can't turn away among veterans, but we can redirect them.
Agent: Oh, you'll have the [PERSON-2], some information.
EndUser: It's a little bit heart-wrenching.
Agent: Oh, yeah, it is. Of course it is. I mean, I mean, that's interesting. Send me some information about that when you think about it with you. I'd love us to.
EndUser: I will try. It's not my program, so I'd have to get that specific from the cynics.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: What's the name of it?
EndUser: I'm the [PERSON-3] feed our vets and the people who own and operate it, because I'm the managing director of this big tree, but they're the actual owner and operators.
Agent: I'll look it up. Yeah.
Agent: Thank you.
EndUser: Is rich in [PERSON-4]'s sync, [ORG-2] And the other ones that set it up, but it's in multiple locations.
Agent: That's why, and you said it's in [LOC-1]?
Agent: Oh, it's in, okay, but it's in [GPE-3].
EndUser: It's a, well, this, mine's in, they're in [GPE-4], a [GPE-4], [GPE-5]. But they have locations in a few different places.
Agent: I am so thankful to hear about that. I can't wait to learn more. Well, that is not what I called you, and I don't want to take all your time, but man, that's really cool. That is really cool.
Agent: Why did I call you?
Agent: I called you to see how you are, to see you sent me that nice email with the updates.
Agent: I know I've got a management meeting [TIME-3] and I know they're going to ask me about this because I have a, you know, we have two forecast and stuff and sales, of course, and I've got this slated for some time in [DATE-2], just based on the timeline you and I talked about.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: But do you know.
Agent: Just, I mean, I know the business problem that's going on and I know that there's a, an RF, what is it?
Agent: An I, an [ORG-3] request from what?
EndUser: Cr. Oh yeah. I think you're talking about the CR to tenures of the funding.
Agent: Yeah, an [ORG-3]. Yeah, so the funding, that was a question of mine.
Agent: What about the funding?
Agent: I think you told me that it was available per [PERSON-5] and [PRODUCT-1]. And you said stay away from [PERSON-6] and [ORG-4] or maybe I wrote that. He's an unfundly to salesperson. No, my boss said that.
Agent: He's met with him.
Agent: So do you know anything about the funding?
EndUser: I only think that I'm going to give you the spiel that I got from the contracting team.
EndUser: I sort of try to press four some answers on where we are, right?
EndUser: But far, I'm going to answer your question. So the funding is really coming from our [ORG-5] acquisition funds, our acquisition workforce funding. That's all I know. I don't know what that means.
EndUser: I don't know how much is in there. I don't know how they're going to allocate this or anything. I just know that that's where the money is coming from, at least for the initial contract. So...
EndUser: Whether the contracts come into you or not, I don't know. This is what I was told by contracts.
EndUser: I did my part and the reason that they have us do the market research is for this exact reason because when I get called by the carries and the mass and everybody, which I don't want to make it sound like you should be calling me.
Agent: Right?
EndUser: I don't mind giving whatever updates I do get. But they basically said there's a lot in the sand from you to the market research, but we do the government stuff. So there's no, they don't make contact.
EndUser: You did not request this, so this isn't about you. But somebody else was like, we'd like to talk to your contractor team. So I was like, OK, sure, whatever, I'm just the middleman here waiting for a product.
EndUser: I just want to use the dang thing. I don't care what name it is. I mean, honestly, I don't care what name is on the on the on the application.
EndUser: I just want to get busy and we're waiting on this. But contracting said, that's not how we do business. We don't have conversations with the vendors.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: We don't entertain meetings. We don't. pick and choose what we do is we look at what you're asking for, and the price goes to give us and the capability that they've informed you of.
Agent: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
EndUser: And then we can do all the government stuff, which is way more complex than I ever want to learn, but thank God for them for that, right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And basically they told me is that the only answer that they can give is that they are in the pre-solicitation phases of putting everything together so they can get it over the legal team to make sure it's good to go out for solicitation, and that once it goes to the solicitation.
EndUser: That's when the vendors that I reached out to ask for all the different quotes will either get the notification that we're asking or they won't get the notification that we're asking.
EndUser: So, however they move forward is how are they moving forward.
Agent: I get that.
Agent: Do you know yet what vehicle it was going to go out on that [ORG-6] 2 for the [ORG-7] yet?
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: So they kind of went back and forth on that. And that was a point of like confusion for me because I really didn't understand what they were in the beginning and I've learned a lot.
EndUser: What they basically told us is us as a me and my management. is that they have a choice of which one makes the most sense.
EndUser: And they asked us, what do you want?
EndUser: And we said, we want it [DATE-3]. And they said, OK, so speed is the fact that it matters the nose. And we said, yes. So they said based on that, they can kind of choose which way they go.
EndUser: But we may limit ourselves to base your only, and then explore other options for option [DATE-4]. We may be able to get a base plus four, and then explore other options after [DATE-5].
EndUser: It just kind of depends on what they find out. So that's part of what their stuff is.
EndUser: Like the legal review and all that, that's what they're putting together now is which way can we go, which way should we go, and which way do we need to go and measure those out against the downfall of choosing one of the other.
Agent: I don't know.
EndUser: So we may not get it as fast as we want.
Agent: But it's not out yet. Right.
EndUser: Right, it's not out. It's not solicitation. Not yet, which is, which is outside of the time that they give us for this scope, but what we were basically so. That was the first thing we threw in their faces.
EndUser: You said this should be done [DATE-6], and we should already in the solicitation, they're like, well, here's the deal.
EndUser: Our office, the office that's supporting us, their office, [ORG-8], is not normally the office that puts together contracts for services or subscriptions or whatever, that they usually typically handle the higher up stuff.
EndUser: But because it's within their per view of job, they're doing it because of where the request is coming from.
EndUser: But because they don't normally do it and they've never had to do it, they've had to go figure out some things that they didn't know.
Agent: I get it.
EndUser: And on top of that, they still have to go do all the higher level contract stuff like when people make complaints about, oh, you've turned it our contract and they have to go.
Agent: That makes sense.
EndUser: Yeah. So they were like, we kind of got back that with two of those. I don't remember what he called them, but they're basically equivalent to the lawsuits for contracting.
Agent: Yeah, no, I know.
EndUser: So I deal with those two and then right.
Agent: And that's how it is with these. Yeah.
EndUser: And I think they're just being extra vigilant because of those two.
Agent: Don't worry about that. I get that.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I bet and I'll keep my eye out on [ORG-6] and [ORG-7]. I got to jump to a o'clock call.
Agent: I know I called you, but it's with my boss or I wouldn't cut you off because he's a [ORG-9] and he's like that.
EndUser: No, fine.
Agent: And this is the information I needed.
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: This elicitation's not out yet. I'm going to be a hero.

Agent: [PERSON-7], [PERSON-8]. Make a couple of things.
Agent: What is it?
Agent: So basically, I guess the all accounts tab. on in my system, but because I know that you guys do keep the information on the database, leave it if they can't be activated or whatever it is.
Agent: But what I'm initially trying to [ORG-3] is, and I know you guys use CSV files for extracting reports and data and doing transfers from account to account.
Speaker 2: You
Agent: But When I'm trying to get the, basically the information on the account for now one or the notes and stuff, I get that that cannot be copied because, you know, mainly it's just to see the file and I'm a spreadsheet that you guys can extract from an account that has, you know, all the account details, addresses, you being contact, name, number, email.
Agent: So essentially that's what I'm primarily author. Secondly, we'll be to also discuss the account because I might want to reactivate it. But look, you know, one step at a time like
Speaker 2: Okay, I will have to get back to you on that once I find who the account owner is because they have the rights or the access to do that.
Speaker 2: Me personally, I can't do that right now, but I can find who it is, who will then send Hopefully, any of those files, as well as get in touch with you to discuss with you, our friends for the business.
Agent: This. Yep.
Agent: Oh yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But that's cool.

Speaker 2: Mm. Yeah. Mm.
Agent: But if you can shoot me an email, just in regards to our conversation, but then just in regards to our follow-up, if you're going to afford it to my request to the accounts management team or something like that, then at least I can track it, and then we can just follow up on our conversation rather than.

Speaker 2: Yeah, sounds good.
Agent: Yeah, yeah.

009087_167_0LQ3y000008brwQGAQ,"Agent: [PERSON-1], I'm calling over from your [ORG-1] account team.
Agent: How are you doing?
EndUser: Okay, here we go.
Agent: Good, good. It was just reaching out. I don't work on the dramatic account team over here. Another use specifically working on the Marketing department over there, [ORG-1], anything that falls under your role and responsibility over there, [PERSON-2].
[ORG-2] [PERSON-3], I'm actually not no longer tethered to dramatic marketing.
EndUser: I moved out of that role in [DATE-1] and now I'm strictly devoted to of the mathematics and key on business transformation project, which so the work stream I'm assigned to that lead actually is a part of the business transformation effort is the market to lead work stream which effectively is kind of the front end right before [ORG-1], but we do have development work we undertake obviously to link I'll call it other Marketing activities and channels and I'll see you in the next video.
[ORG-2] Technologies like [ORG-3], for example, is our [ORG-4] platform. So we're doing, you know, waves of development to actually tie it, just tie these things together with [ORG-1].
EndUser: So you might say, that's why I say tangentially, I'm like involved from a, strictly from a future business transformation view of what [PERSON-4] and [ORG-3] kind of set up will look like.
EndUser: But it's, it's, um, I'm not sitting in the Marketing function [DATE-2], basically working with the legacy Dematic Salesforce or [ORG-3] at all. I'm strictly setting up the new processes and technologies when getting them all connected up.
EndUser: Does that make sense?
Agent: Yeah, no, that does make sense. Um, okay.
Agent: Yeah, so I, I work over here on the accounting alongside [PERSON-5], and who's your account rep. Um, have you ever spoken with [PERSON-6] before by chance?
Agent: What's the next?
EndUser: Not that I can, the last account rep I can remember was, God, I just had his name on the tip of my tongue.
EndUser: [PERSON-7]?
Agent: Oh yeah, that's correct. I was gonna say maybe [PERSON-8].
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: So, but that's been like [DATE-3] or [DATE-4] since I last talked, I know it was been a long time, but I like it said my role changed anyway, so we're, I'm basically now working for [GPE-1] essentially trying to, not trying to, we're in the latter stages of standing up the [ORG-5] products for rollout in [GPE-2] in [DATE-5], and then we're going to other countries directly after, including the [GPE-3].
EndUser: So, but it's all the future sort of instance and [ORG-6] sort of set up in nothing really legacy related.
EndUser: Does that make sense?
Agent: Got it. Okay. No, yeah, that does make sense. Yeah, I know that [PERSON-8] was on the account for a while. And then [PERSON-6] had recently taken over. I know there's obviously been a few conversations that we had with.
Agent: Like the team out in [GPE-4] it was. So that makes sense.
Agent: Yeah, I mean, [PERSON-2], I know that you mentioned that you're kind of congencially in sales force, right?
Agent: So working on kind of some business initiatives. I know obviously you mentioned that it's something that's gonna be down the road.
Agent: But I mean, does it make sense to maybe get [TIME-1] just to catch up with [PERSON-6] and the team over here?
Agent: Just make sure that you guys are like best supported or.
Agent: Is there anything kind of that we can do on our end to maybe assist?
EndUser: Possibly, but it'd be almost more informational maybe, or yeah, it could be potentially just more on the informational side only because the adoption of [ORG-1] is, how would I say this the best way.
EndUser: Understandably it's been kind of taken out of [ORG-7] sort of soul hands and placed into the hands of [PERSON-9] IT and [PERSON-9] procurement and like who I know, and I know all these people, they're like really great people and everything, they're really smart, like everybody's wired in together.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: So it's like no longer a dramatic owned and fully operated world kind of on its own.
Agent: Breathe.
EndUser: It's now kind of moved into the [PERSON-9] sort of stratosphere.
EndUser: So that would mean, you know, that's why I say for me, it might be more potentially from an informational or training perspective possibly, but outside of that, I mean, our decision making, role now is like even when I we did the business case to adopt [ORG-3], that was you know a [DATE-6] process that you know I led the effort but I didn't I couldn't I couldn't have made the change or the purchase without final approval and think you're actually the signature on the contracts actually came from the key on IT and procurement people in [GPE-4].
EndUser: So that just tells you like The mathematics not even any longer is not in its own agreement.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It seems so as long as with that backdrop, that's why I say the involvement I have now is more sort of strategic and sort of laying foundations for future and less about buying more stuff because that's now handled by other people.
EndUser: So as long as everybody understands that is what's going on here, then that's why I say it might be more from an informational perspective.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: That part could potentially be helpful, but outside of that, I can't really think of much, just given kind of how [PERSON-10] has chosen to household all this stuff from a decision-making Implementation point of view over in [GPE-4].
Agent: Right. No, that makes complete sense. And yeah, and [PERSON-6] and I, you know, we told [ORG-8], but we have the key on and the Matic account as well.
Agent: So we've definitely spoken with some folks over at the Matic who are like, you know, obviously happy to connect, but all the decision making power really is made at the key on level currently.
Agent: So yeah, I mean, maybe, you know, maybe what we'll do, I know that, you know, [DATE-7] is wrapping up soon. But maybe what I'll do is send over.
Agent: You know, [TIME-2], if it's, you know, educational, maybe, you know, if there's any enablements, like things that we can kind of provide.
Agent: You know, we'd love to just learn a little bit more about kind of your role and speak with [PERSON-6] and then we can get you any, you know, webinars, resources, whatever it may be.
Agent: But yeah, I mean, you know, it would be great to maybe set up [TIME-1] in [DATE-8] if you'd be open to that.
EndUser: Yeah, sure. That's fine.
Agent: Okay. Let me do what's easiest for you.
Agent: I mean, Do you have your calendar open or do you want me to just maybe shoot over sometimes?
EndUser: Let me look and see.
Agent: I can pull up [PERSON-6]'s calendar. Give me [TIME-3].
EndUser: Think I have my calendar together.
EndUser: Yeah, for me, I mean, probably, what's this?
EndUser: Probably, like, oh, the other thing is I didn't mention this. I actually worked part-time. So I'm not even a full-time employee anymore. I'm just working part-time.
EndUser: So the best thing for me is to figure out how to do this during the morning Eastern time because I'm typically off in the afternoons.
Agent: Okay, no worries.
EndUser: So for what it's worth, mornings are better as what I'm trying to say. And so for that reason, I would say, you know, Right now for me, [DATE-9], there's some open times in [DATE-10].
EndUser: That's probably the best timeframe I can put out there.
Agent: Okay, let's see. I'll send over.
Agent: What I send over an invite now for [DATE-10] at, can you do [TIME-4]?
Agent: Okay, all right, I'll send a time slot over for that right now.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: And then for any reason, we need to move that around or whatnot, we can definitely make that happen. But that way we'll have it on there [DATE-15] out from now [DATE-12], I think that would be good.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: All right, well, perfect. Well, I just sent that over to you.
Agent: Best email is just [PERSON-10].Jibbo, is that your last name?
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Ok, at thematic.com. Awesome.
EndUser: Yep, this just came through.
Agent: Great. OK, cool. All right, well, wonderful. Yeah, [PERSON-2], obviously, I'll speak to [PERSON-6], let him know a little bit about what we spoke about.
Agent: Obviously, we understand that all the decisions are kind of made at the count level, but. Yeah, we'd love to just learn a little bit more about your role.
Agent: I know you mentioned that you've kind of been transitioning a little bit. So love to learn a little bit more about your role and how we can just best support you going into [DATE-16].
EndUser: Sure. Sounds good. Thanks.
Agent: All right. Awesome. Well, thanks, [PERSON-2]. I appreciate the time. I'll, like I said, if there's anything that comes up, you know, just don't have to say to reach out, we can definitely move that around if need be.
Agent: But I hope you have a wonderful weekend and we'll look forward to speaking with you on [DATE-10]. Yep.
EndUser: Yeah, thanks so much. We call. I appreciate it. Take care.
Agent: No problem, [PERSON-2]. Have a great day. We'll talk soon.

The salesperson did not explicitly connect their solution to this specific need, but they did show an understanding of the buyer's role and responsibilities in the business transformation effort. The salesperson also offered to provide informational resources and training to support the buyer's role, which may be seen as a step in the right direction. However, the buyer's role has changed, and they are no longer directly involved in the marketing function, which may make it challenging for the salesperson to effectively connect their solution to the buyer's specific needs.","Did the salesperson manage to establish a rapport with the buyer, or did the conversation seem forced or awkward?","The conversation between the salesperson and the buyer, [PERSON-2], seemed to be somewhat forced or awkward at times.

011357_167_0LQ3y00000988wBGAQ,"Agent: [PERSON-1] force.
EndUser: Yes, who is this?
Agent: Hey, [PERSON-2], this is [PERSON-3]. I was giving you a call ahead of the Salesforce World Poor event [DATE-1] at the end of the chat.
EndUser: Sure, of course, what's going on?
Agent: How much?
Agent: How are you doing, man?
EndUser: I'm doing alright.
Agent: So I guess I was just reaching out to see if I could be of any help and see what your interest for while you're there, pointing in the direction of some relevant sessions, anything like that?
EndUser: Yeah, you know what, I'd love to know the agenda because I'm going to have to be, unfortunately, I got a couple other meetings that I got to step out for, so I just want to make sure that I can work around the agenda.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And I saw kind of the high level, right?
EndUser: But again, maybe kind of, if you could talk me through some of those areas of focus, I can say, yeah, you know what, that's of interest.
Agent: Okay, so what I can do, I'm actually calling from the [NORP-1] side of the business. I don't know if you're familiar with [NORP-1] at all.
EndUser: I'm not.
Agent: So, [NORP-1] is the integration and automation on the [ORG-1], but I will certainly be able to get you, I mean, before I even go into any of that, I will certainly be able to hopefully get you a more in-depth look at the agenda and the detail in there.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: That'd be great. That'd be great.
Agent: So I'll reach out to your lead, I guess, the person leading [ORG-2] over there and see if we can get you something a little bit tailored.
EndUser: Challenge good. Okay.
Agent: But as far as my role goes, I'm on the automation and integration side here at [ORG-1]. So I don't know if any of that would be of interest to you while you're there.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: Uh... look you know what i mean i think let me let me give a little perspective for a kind of my role here uh... and maybe you can give me some perspective on how we can connect or not right uh... so definitely. Yeah, definitely.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, what's worth [TIME-1] of me learning more about what you do. Maybe there's mutual fit. Maybe there's not. Either way, like I said, I'm happy to provide you in more detail.
Agent: I think beneficially the way, right?
EndUser: Yeah sounds good yep agreed give me one second hold on
Agent: A lot of places going forward, maybe we can work together again next
Agent: Year. Yeah, or maybe I say we should have worked together [DATE-2]. I'm going to go over my water. I'm going to go over my water.
EndUser: All right, I'm back. So just let me give you a little bit of background.
Agent: All right.
EndUser: So I'm on the risk management side, and my area of expertise is operational risk.
Agent: All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: And one of the spaces that I focus on are, obviously, new and innovative use of data, obviously, how we think about responsible use of [FAC-1] and how potential use cases across the industry can help benefit met life.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So those are, I guess, my three going into the conversation, three areas of interest for me.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. like obviously. Okay.
EndUser: Obviously, with my risk management hat on, I'm always thinking of obviously the what can go wrong, how do we make sure we have the right controls in place, but from a use case standpoint, I'd love to know how other insurance companies are leveraging AI solutions in terms of their processes.
Agent: So, do you know what data the entity is?
EndUser: So hopefully that gives you a little bit of context.
Agent: Yeah, it definitely does. I think that helps a lot.
Agent: So I think, I mean, [FAC-1] is going to be, I think, the main focus of the event as it is for pretty much all intern companies and how, I feel like almost everyone I talk to is there for the exact same reason you are, right?
Agent: They want to see how AI is being used in other businesses or in other intern firms, the right ways in the wrong ways and looking into those use cases and like, What is the appable technology out there to help my role?
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Agent: So for you putting on that risk hat of what are we, how are we going to secure that data?
Agent: So that's actually a use case that we've talked with. We're actually, we're the API hub of [ORG-1] too, so we do API management.
Agent: So governance and security of data through APIs, I don't know if that would be more up your alley. So that's something that we've been working with, I guess a little downstream in the [FAC-1] processes.
Agent: How are you going to protect that data that's output from AI?
Agent: How are you going to make sure that the right data is coming out and that you're not having like your AI call to something like PII or confidential information, something like that out of the data system, it's point two.
EndUser: Right mm-hmm look
Agent: So I think we're kind of advocating on that front to use APIs for that data security and for the governance of the actual responses that the [FAC-1] can give. So that's one area that we've seen a lot.
Agent: And then the other big one that may not be as app holding you is, you know, the idea of when you're collecting that data, when you're pulling that data together, and you want it to be in an adjustable format to go into your AI, you kind of have like the garbage in garbage out, right?
Agent: Like the, our [FAC-1] can only be as good as the data that we're feeding into it.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: So that's, those are the two big areas from [ORG-3] comes in is to pull all of that data out of any system from legacies [PRODUCT-1], [PRODUCT-2], any system out there, it can kind of be wrangled, put into a digestible form, and then input into the [FAC-1], and then more upstream, maybe where you'd be focused on from a risk perspective is how do we control the information that's able to flow out of it from there?
EndUser: Yep.
EndUser: Yeah, and I guess an extension of that is how do we minimize the data that's fed into the [FAC-1] platform to only that which is necessary?
Agent: Yeah, and I've you considered the strategy that you're going to use for that?
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, certainly we work very closely with our data team.
EndUser: You know, our data governance or our data analytics team to ensure that we have controls to, you know, run data minimization, data integrity and those sort of things.
Agent: We just got more than why it works. It works for the whole mixture of what we have going. And then we'll be able to identify the
EndUser: So that we're getting, obviously, the best output, but clearly it's an evolving space, right?
Agent: Problem. Yeah, I mean, it's got to be like the fastest moving space out there right now.
EndUser: You're right.
Agent: Seeing everyone go through these problems at the same time.
Agent: Find to boil the ocean in terms of how we're getting our data in, how are we making sure like you said the data minimization is there, how are we going to secure it. I mean it's a mess right.
Agent: So I think it's really helpful to go to events like this to see what the industry is doing and how the industry is looking at things.
EndUser: Agreed.
Agent: But yeah.
EndUser: So why don't we do this?
EndUser: I mean, I think it'd be really beneficial for me.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: To attend the event [DATE-1] and again if you can give me an additional point in the direction of where I can get additional insight is to the agenda that would be helpful and then maybe after the event obviously we can reconnect once I've had an opportunity to see and experience what you know what I hear in the room right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Might spur more ideas.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: I was going to say, would you, I mean, while we were talking now, maybe we could even look into just throwing in like a placeholder now to bring in one of my solutions engineers do a call to help explain how our technology does help to secure, secure, minimize the data going into [FAC-1].
Agent: If that would be any of an interest to you, to set up like a little tailored session for just us for [TIME-2] around that.
EndUser: Yeah, why don't we do that?
EndUser: But I will caveat that by saying I may not be the right point of contact, right, within the organization to have that discussion.
Agent: Absolutely. Yeah.
EndUser: So, you know, we may end up moving, canceling, extending to other folks within the team, right?
EndUser: But I'm happy to put something on the calendar now for [TIME-3].
Agent: Yeah. Absolutely.
Agent: And yeah, I mean, I'll shoot it over for 30 just to make sure we get sufficient coverage, but if it goes under that to make that successful, I think that's a good idea just in terms of we don't need you to be the perfect point of contact.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: But I think getting those conversations rolling off the ground is key. And I think the earlier that you can get that done, right, the better.
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: I'm actually be able to accept. So I'll write delivery for that.
EndUser: Yep. Okay.
Agent: All right.
Agent: How does [DATE-3], [DATE-4] look?
Agent: I guess that's [DATE-5] after. So we can look at [DATE-6] as well.
EndUser: Let's look at [DATE-7]. My schedule [DATE-1] is a mess.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Obviously, [DATE-7] tends to <inaudible> down a little bit because obviously people start to head out.
Agent: Totally fine. Yeah.
EndUser: How about [DATE-8]?
Agent: But I could certainly still send it. Yeah, that could work for me.
EndUser: I've got [DATE-9]. Yep.
Agent: [ORG-4].
Agent: Do you have anything else other than that?
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: I think that's... o'clock?
EndUser: I've got something in the afternoon. I can probably do [TIME-4]. Yep.
Agent: Okay, let's actually do the 9.39474515444174.
EndUser: I could do 4. is going to be a little difficult.
Agent: What does your [DATE-10] look like?
EndUser: You could do the [DATE-10] all when uh... so [DATE-15] look when they said that a lot more open for me i can do uh... [TIME-5]
Agent: I can make the 10.144897014935766 work. But yeah, I can also do [DATE-10]. Cool.
Agent: I have an AM. All right, that works perfectly.
EndUser: Yep
Agent: So I will throw this invite over.
Agent: Are you still [PERSON-2], E.K.V.K.POS1 at [ORG-2]?
Agent: Yeah. Awesome. I will throw it over to you, and I'll just title it [WORK_OF_ART-1]. I will just title it [WORK_OF_ART-1]. You'll stop in that life AI conversation. I should be able to
EndUser: Sounds good.
Agent: Make that.
EndUser: All right, I'm going to have to apologize because I'm [TIME-6] late to my next meeting.
Agent: Oh, actually, so shoot. I'm sorry, that actually my solution engineer has a conflict on [DATE-10].
Agent: Is there any way that we could bump that either to [DATE-9] or?
EndUser: Sure I can do. So sticking to [DATE-10], I can even do. Two thirty.
EndUser: Let me see, hold on, let me just make sure. Oh, no, sorry, [TIME-7] [TIME-8]. All
Agent: O'clock. Okay, that should work really well.
EndUser: Right.
Agent: That should work very well at three.
EndUser: Wonderful. All right, thank you very much.
Agent: Awesome. Thank you.
EndUser: You, [PERSON-4].
