012731_167_0LQ3y000009NyzkGAC,"EndUser: Because we have a bunch of landing pages set up and partners with different software spaces, with different software spaces.
EndUser: Basically how we do is, first we hit all the leads, we put on a spreadsheet, we hit all the leads there, my brother does, and then he sent them to me, I hit them again, and then I had them set them to one third person, and if we don't get it, the third person pretty much just tosses away all the old leads because they're obviously, we don't want the kids to do this.
Agent: So you attempt them three times after that, they just fall off.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, because that means. A lot of the spaces that we set a merchant account for are like, you know, like, credit-repared debt relief, tax mitigation lawyers that like, little sketchy stuff.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So, I mean, like, if they don't want to do it on the third call, we don't really want the business.
Agent: Well, let me ask you about the top of the funnel.
Agent: So how are you getting leads coming at the top of the funnel?
EndUser: We have landing pages set up with a different [PRODUCT-1]. A lot of them are built off go high level, but just wide level.
Agent: So you just got like websites essentially for merchant to, it's all inbound then, right?
EndUser: Have some of the things that we've done in the past.
Agent: You don't do any prospecting or anything like that.
EndUser: Not anymore. I mean, we've been, like my brother's in [DATE-1], and I've been doing this for three.
EndUser: And our partners just send us all the leads pretty much, because they all get a percentage off and all the processing fees.
Agent: Yeah, and did you say you're managing all this off of a spreadsheet?
EndUser: Yeah, our cell phones.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: It's not that, because the thing is different about us is that we always, we always try to mention, it's like, you get our cell phones.
EndUser: So like, and they literally do, so I get dumb calls all the time for dumb stuff for 21-L-A charges, but it's fine. I don't mind.
Agent: Okay, I'm just saying. Well, I still think there might be some room for us to help out here, actually.
Agent: And I don't want to take up too much of your time right now so that this college out of the blue.
Agent: Would you be open to scheduling like [TIME-1] conversation to talk a little bit more in depth about it, maybe [DATE-2] or in [DATE-3] sometime?
EndUser: Is your serum like go high level at all?
Agent: Yeah, so we have a lot of different tools that we can use depending on sort of what the needs are for our client. But yeah, our [PRODUCT-1] does everything.
Agent: Like I said, it's the most used [PRODUCT-1] in the world. We have hundreds of thousands of companies that use it from a small mom and pop shop, so all the way up to Enterprise companies.
Agent: So I really can do anything.
Agent: So when you say, is it high level, what do you mean by it?
Agent: Is it high level?
EndUser: No, like go high level, like go [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Oh, similar to that [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: I'm actually not familiar with go high level. I can look into it and see what kind of similarities there are.
Agent: But do you like go high level, or are you not happy with that particular serum right now?
EndUser: No, because like one of the ideas we had, because we have between me and my brother and a couple of one other guy here, we probably have over like 381 [ORG-1] or credit repair companies in [GPE-1] under our portfolio.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: And we want to create our own [PRODUCT-1]. So we're going to buy the license on white label, go high level.
Agent: Okay. What
EndUser: But I don't know if we're going to do that for sure yet.
EndUser: So I was wondering, can you white label sales for us or no?
Agent: Do you do?
Agent: What do you do?
Agent: I like white label it.
EndUser: Like, white label is that we pretty much just use your software and say it's ours. You buy the license for it. That's what it's.
EndUser: That's what, and we kind of like resell it in the sense for people to use. That's what a go-high level does.
Agent: Interesting. Okay. So there might be so you're saying you would license it and then sell it to like your partners.
EndUser: No, we, not our partners, we sell it to basically business owners. To the finish we have, we have partners in other software spaces or other CRMs, specifically for different spaces, let me know for it.
EndUser: Like credit repair, like I said, really taxing stuff like that. That have special programs built into it that help use tools for the [ORG-2] or the credit repair organization or the get release.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Anyway, so we were thinking of selling our own [PRODUCT-1] where we were just going to buy a license from go-high level so we can pretty much just say it's ours. You have to buy a license from them.
EndUser: And then you like, and then you white-led what it is yours. That's what a lot of companies do. Exactly.
Agent: I understand. Okay, so go high level. So you would buy the license to send to you resell that. to all of the [ORG-1] that you're working with, for example. So the [ORG-1] can use it.
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: Got it. I understand. So no, we don't have that option. There's no option for you to sort of license and become a reseller.
Agent: Well, I mean, I guess there are some options for that, but I think it's a little bit more complex than what the Go High level is offering. Really, our bread and butter is to help you, for example.
Agent: Like we would help you get leads like top of funnel. We would help you do marketing. We would help you close at a higher rate than you are currently. Make the sales cycle faster.
Agent: So that's really where our bread and butter is at. We started with the [PRODUCT-1], but like I said, we since expanded to all kinds of other different products. We do marketing.
Agent: We do service if you have existing clients that you retain. We do a lot with AI. I don't know if you've looked into sort of the [PRODUCT-2] and how that could potentially help your business.
Agent: So there's a lot of things that we can help out with, but if you're looking strictly to kind of realise a [PRODUCT-1], unfortunately, I don't think that's an option with [ORG-3].
EndUser: Yeah, I mean honestly, like what you're asking isn't really my call. You know, it would be up to the owners if they call it not myself. I mean, I'm just the salesperson here.
EndUser: It does, it does mention reps, so it really wouldn't be up to me. They let us kind of do whatever we want. I mean, you can go after any type of industry, doesn't really matter.
EndUser: We just thrive in the financial industry, so sketchy. And my.
Agent: A lot of people actually talk to salespeople because of what a understanding experience of the people who are using technology. A lot of times the decision makers aren't even using the technology that you are, for example.
Agent: And so if I talk to you and you say, hey, yeah, this program we're using is not really good. It's really inefficient. It's time consuming.
Agent: Then I have some type of perspective to bring to people who actually make decisions. And I can say, hey, look, I talked to your sales team. They're saying what you use right now is kind of trash.
Agent: There's a lot of room for improvement here. Here's what we do instead and how this could save them time, how this can improve their close rate, things like that.
Agent: So again, if you have, you know, [TIME-2] and we'll take up too much of your time, maybe sometime [DATE-2].
EndUser: And, have thought of the
Agent: We'd love to connect with you. We just talked through a little bit more how you're using technology and see if there's some way we can help out with it.
EndUser: Like, I mean, I don't mind talking to people really. Like, it's all good. Like, whatever, it's fine.
EndUser: But I just, to be honest with you, I just, what we do here, I don't think you can help with it, if that makes sense.
EndUser: Just because like, we're very hands-on, like keeping people compliant or running their businesses, especially the type of high-risk Industries that we're in.
EndUser: Because it's very, I don't know if you're familiar with processors, but what the same level is [NORP-1], [ORG-4], and well as far as [ORG-5], or [ORG-6]. So, but we're a lot smaller.
EndUser: With a lot more high risk industry. So a lot of our merchants, they call us on our cell phones to handle stuff for them, to keep them alive so they can keep running the business.
EndUser: It's not as simple as just the sales cycle. Like it's not, it's a lot more complicated and a lot more hands on.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: That's why like it's easier for me to keep a smaller book and then have, you know, it's not like the car industry when I sell a car and it's done or you follow up five times.
Agent: Yeah, it's not like a volume based industry, right?
EndUser: You get everything?
Agent: So it's, yeah.
EndUser: No, it's a lot more personable, like a lot more.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, and keeping these businesses alive. Like, yeah, we have one two stand alone, like a lot of like restaurants, smoke shops, things like that.
EndUser: Those are easy, I never have to touch, but like the Industries that we're in, like it's a lot more hands-on because these domestic car can come shut you off, whatever.
EndUser: So our job is to make sure we, it's like a high wire act, if that makes sense.
Agent: Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I still think there might be some way we can help you out here, actually. And we don't just do volume.
Agent: You know, so I mean, one of the things we do is help.
EndUser: Here.
Agent: Companies increase the number of leads, but not all companies want to do that.
Agent: And it sounds like maybe you're in a similar position where you don't want a ton more leads because it's you have such a high touch business.
Agent: But I think there's ways for us to help maybe streamline what you're doing. Like if you're working on the back of an [PRODUCT-3] spreadsheet, which a lot of our customers do, there's certainly ways that we can help that.
Agent: With that.
Agent: Just make it more efficient for you, give you a better view of all your accounts and all your clients, make it easier for you to manage them, make it easier for you to do any Outreach if you need to, easier to respond to them, things like that.
EndUser: Profile simply and that will slide.
Agent: So, if we had another conversation, if it turned out we're not a good fit for you, I'll absolutely let you know because it's really meant to be a partnership.
Agent: We want to help you, but if we're not the best fit, I'll just say, hey, you're right, maybe this isn't the best type of technology for you to use.
Agent: But again, if you need [TIME-2] [DATE-4], we can make that decision and see if it's even worth pursuing after that.
EndUser: Yeah, I'll do that, bro. I'll do that.
EndUser: I mean, I'm in the same same place as you, you know what I mean?
EndUser: Like just co-com people trying to make it happen, you know.
Agent: I appreciate that, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: So I'll give you the time, bro.
Agent: Yeah, man, I won't take too much time. I know you're busy and your husband is [DATE-5]. So let me send you an email. You're at [FAC-1] at BankCardUSA.
EndUser: Yeah, just do it. Just probably just call me at [DATE-6] at [DATE-7] and I'll be available.
Agent: Okay. Cool. I'll give you a call then and we can talk for [TIME-2].
Agent: Is there a way that you can show me like the technology you're using like a screen share or something like that?
EndUser: I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a break.
Agent: Because that would be helpful for us. No.
EndUser: Uh-uh.
EndUser: Did you think a lot of this stuff has personal information regarding the business owners?
Agent: I totally understand. I was in the instrument of super long time, so I totally get that. Okay.
EndUser: Who did you work for?
Agent: No worries. Yeah, I worked for [PERSON-2] for [DATE-8].
EndUser: Oh,
Agent: I was a financial advisor there. And then I was also in [ORG-7]. I did startups for [DATE-9].
EndUser: Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha regarding the payments side of the business.
Agent: Yeah. Now, I was never on the payment side of the business. Nope, I was just on the financial advisory side of the business.
EndUser: I mean, we'll chop it up.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: I mean, you know, I'm like a friend of mine. But it's you. So I have no problem. It's been [DATE-10] in time.
Agent: Really appreciate that, [PERSON-1]. Hey, thanks again for your time [DATE-9].

EndUser: Yep, that one should have gone through already, right?
Agent: Yeah, that went through swirl set on that. And then I think the last three things. I guess I'll start with IGS sandbox. I know before you left that one has been all submitted. You got the [ORG-1].
Agent: I'm signature [ORG-2].
EndUser: Not waiting for Yeah, bad news on that one. I just got an email, I think, yes, [DATE-1] that project's been put on hold. So we're not going to be able to do that sandbox.
EndUser: So that's going to be a good fortune to fall through. But the HCLS one and the [ORG-3] stuff is still moving that we're waiting for the final.
EndUser: I got a message from [PERSON-1] on [DATE-2] looks like [PERSON-2] was going back and forth with him. He said he needs [DATE-3] to get all the information for it.
EndUser: So we should have that as soon as everybody's back.
EndUser: And then that would be right away So we might not even need those free licenses I hate that I made you go through all this stuff but Everybody drag their feet on you well No, it's OK .
Agent: Well, it's fine at [DATE-4].
EndUser: I think don't the free ones is the only thing we might not use We'll see what
Agent: I don't get paid on those anyway We're gonna get the
EndUser: Big one though the half million or whatever that is gonna go through so that'll be a help
Agent: Big Okay, that'll Yeah, that is that will be amazing for me. So appreciate it Definitely.
EndUser: And then the [ORG-4] sandbox should still go through too, right?
EndUser: That was another one we had.
Agent: I thought it was [ORG-5].
Agent: Are you talking about the [ORG-4] sandbox renewal?
EndUser: Yeah, that one. I'm still trying to remember what's going on too.
Agent: [PERSON-3] you just asked about Remember it was like [MONEY-1] and I think we said we could probably get it down to 139 through their life with the seal up.
EndUser: A sandbox.
EndUser: And the last update
Agent: You said was I think [ORG-5] was just taking that price back for leadership to see if it was feasible.
EndUser: And it doesn't look like I have anything back on that. I'm gonna pin that email so I'll follow up on that one whenever.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: More back.
Agent: Yeah, if that could replace that [ORG-6] sandbox, that would be awesome.
EndUser: Yeah, this is going to be a good one two for you.
Agent: And then for [ORG-6] the project can put on hold. Do you have an
EndUser: Idea until when or why?
EndUser: Just because all after this. It's just going to be internal funding probably.
Agent: But let me see exactly what she said.
EndUser: I'll read it right to you. That'd be awesome. The IGS [PRODUCT-1] CPU project has been placed on hold until further notice from leadership. As she's going to announce earlier. Please be advised. I'll work. You just stop immediately.
EndUser: Finally cancel calls. I'll update you on new information. So no, on when it'll come back at all.
Agent: No timeline
EndUser: But cool. I would assume it's funding. I know [ORG-7] has been kind of up and down, especially [ORG-6] has been rocky. I was honestly surprised to
Agent: Even started that project. So that'll be. Yeah. Didn't they kind of just call you and be like, we already purchased this other CPU thing and
EndUser: Need to implement it [DATE-5]. Cool. We should head out. Our projects, my architect, literally found out about it because he automatically was a kickoff call. And we're like, wait, this is a CBQ problem. A lot of [ORG-8] changes.
EndUser: And you're talking to anybody about this?
EndUser: No.
EndUser: Would you build it for any [ORG-8] people?

Agent: That's awesome. Okay, that's an old [ORG-9] you'll follow up on.
EndUser: And [ORG-3], when people were back, probably just like the second. Yeah, I think people come back
Agent: On the third, I think, is when we're we're back. So, so we can follow up with [PERSON-1] then.
EndUser: Okay,
Agent: Maybe hopefully have all
EndUser: The information you needed to submit the [ORG-1] and then we're good. Yeah, yeah, [PERSON-2]'s been harassing them [DATE-6]. He's he's a little relentless stuff, which is good.
EndUser: But yeah, that one, that one I expect to go through, I have seen no, they're just trying to find where the money's from and prioritize all the end of That shouldn't be an issue.
Agent: Your stuff. So,
EndUser: That's the one I know the big one for you. And then one, that one I don't know.
Agent: Yeah, the [ORG-5]
EndUser: We're pushing them to try to have a box there. I think you got them a great deal on it. So they would kind of be dumb not
Agent: To if they are ever going to need the sandbox. This is the one they should take. But yeah. Yeah. Cool.

EndUser: Good, thank you. Good, that one's good. Yeah,
Agent: I'm good. It's [DATE-1] at [DATE-2] was [DATE-3], so [DATE-4] of house has been pretty hectic, but it's a little calmer [DATE-5].
Agent: I have watched the video, also checking the document for
EndUser: Switching from current plan to the Enterprise switch, the pricing features which are available.
EndUser: I also were able to win [DATE-6] to check if our management with our finance with Nasely And in this case, as we have seen number change, from all parts we receive in confirmation, not to do any current change and wait until we have final view of exact exact numbers.
EndUser: And because we will be able to plan for the future to understand in the future, the seat numbers will be extended or seat numbers may be decreased again. And I see so.
EndUser: Yes, we need to wait until having final view of seat numbers.
Agent: Gotcha. So yeah, so I like you. So it sounds like I've got the numbers for 714, but we're still not sure if that's an accurate number.
EndUser: So what I'm hearing. Okay. We need to wait to have an exact number because currently we are using a cyber member 682 numbers.
Agent: It's about 921 right now. Yeah.
EndUser: And after shaving full view, we will be able to again discuss with the finance and teams for appropriate pay budget for switching from current business plan. to Enterprise plan.
EndUser: There is a, I also check it and there is a, in case of me, in case of my team, the future of API activity checking, monitoring management is created for us.
EndUser: Also, [PERSON-1] confirmed that there is also many futures that are very usable, very nice to have in our everyday world. but currently to wait to have a full view .
Agent: That's fair.
Agent: Yeah, I was just going to ask you, do you have a kind of rough timeline in mind of when you will have a better idea of numbers of users?
EndUser: Currently, I don't know. But I think during [DATE-7], during [DATE-7]. Yes. 10th of the [DATE-8]. OK.
Agent: Yeah, I understand. I mean, I get where you're coming from. It's obviously not an easy conversation, if you're expecting to lay off some people and stuff. And you don't know your full understanding of numbers.
Agent: So I understand it's a fragile situation and stuff and that. So I have a better idea. So yeah, I mean, I'm happy to try and help you with that.
Agent: Also, as soon as we have clear view, we will take to you the update. And on the time we can again return to discussion to switching from current plan to Enterprise plan. Right.
Agent: So do you think Do you think doing making a decision or executing on upgrading to the Enterprise plan in [DATE-9] as a realistic or?
Agent: If you're thinking of numbers in [DATE-8], like I'm just curious of what kind of what timeline you're looking at. I'm going to say on [PERCENT-1]
EndUser: And it not depends on the from my opinion or not the least opinion. It depends also from management from the finance. Of course.
EndUser: Because during the planning of the budget, already for [DATE-10], budget is planted and each team needs to keep its planning to avoid unexpected situations.
Agent: That's fair. I wasn't really meaning to ask if, If it was like, yes, you're going to move or not. It was just if you think you'll have it.
Agent: Do you know by [DATE-11] roughly how many numbers?
Agent: But once you have that number and grid is something that you might or might not want to do, I'm just curious how fast you could move if it was something you wanted to do.
EndUser: Yes.
EndUser: Why switching is interesting and mandatory for a park?
EndUser: Because for [DATE-10] we have planned it in our care results, the improving of [ORG-1] and in this case switching from current plant to Enterprise will be the main point of improving [ORG-1] in case of [ORG-2] usage in case of API and automation monitoring out it logs.
Agent: Gotcha.
Agent: So I mean, I know we have [TIME-1] on the calendar [DATE-5]. We don't need to use the time I have.
Agent: I don't know whether it be worthwhile going through a refresher of what you get on the Enterprise plan for you or what would be a good use of your time [DATE-5].
EndUser: I think all is okay and we do not need to change or update any information. I just have missed the information from previous conversation. Just join a chat because of a small time we're not able to fully review.
EndUser: And only last during [DATE-5] I have reviewed information, talk it with the teams management for possible switching to confirmation. and the main response that wait until we have full vie w and understand what we are going to do
Agent: Okay And there's one slide, I guess I could share with you as well because there's four . or releases happening [DATE-10] that are added to grid.
Agent: There's something that will be probably not interesting from [GPE-1]'s point of view is [PERSON-2] which is like an internal organization chart that you're going to have within your [ORG-2] instance so you can see everybody's bio and you can see who their manager is and that those kind of teams.
Agent: So that's going to be embedded into the tool. There's also going to be data loss prevention in the tool.
Agent: So right now it's just for [ORG-3], but I think [DATE-9] is going to be across the whole of [ORG-2].
Agent: So you can monitor for sensitive information flowing through your Slack instance and you can trap it with the data loss prevention. And another one is more deeper analytics, so more granular with information and things like that.
Agent: But I can share that with you after this as well. Just so you know what's on the roadmap for [DATE-10] to further enhance the Enterprise plan.
EndUser: Okay, thank you very much. It will be great. I also reviewed the information. And the main part of the list was the analytics information which you and your team.
Agent: There you go. Well, great. I mean, you have my direct line. And obviously, just let me know if and when you have questions.
Agent: And then when you do have a better understanding of users, I can get back to the drawing board and seeing what we can do together.
EndUser: Ok, good. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. No worries.
Agent: Thank you. Have a good one. Cheers. Have a nice vacation. Cheers.

EndUser: But is that why it's in there in case new affiliates or anything are added?

EndUser: We're hoping by [DATE-20] of like. what the path is so we can redo our timelines and all that stuff. So I don't know at this point.
EndUser: What I'm working on [DATE-14] is like putting more backing behind why getting [ORG-4] done ASAP is the thing we need to do and put our engineering resources towards.

EndUser: How are you doing?
Agent: Hey, doing well. Thanks for asking. I know the weather there is probably not too great, but
EndUser: Ah, right now the sun is out and it's not too breezy. We're going to get rain [TIME-2] though. So it's all good.
Agent: I mean, we always need rain in [GPE-1].
EndUser: Yeah, I'll take it.
Agent: Yeah, but perfect.
Agent: This is the reason for my call [DATE-1] is I've just been speaking some of the police departments and fire departments just around the issue around recruitment and retention and I was just wondering is that something that's top of mind right now for you.
EndUser: The retention part is not.
EndUser: I think in the state of [GPE-1] or actually across the country, the recruitment piece is going to always be, I don't know if it ever will get better like it was back in [DATE-2].
EndUser: You know, we have thousand people lining up for 10 jobs, but it's gotten down to where Rosofire only hires paramedics. And then that's the pool for that has gotten much, much smaller.
EndUser: You know, we hired EMTs or we hired EMTs and then we trained and become very much, but we only hire paramedics. So that's why our pool is smaller and sometimes harder to recruit.
EndUser: And I end up going after lateral firefighters more than I do off the street guys here lately in [DATE-3] from other agencies.
Agent: Oh yeah, I can totally understand that. I know it's a widespread issue right now. Just getting some more people in the door. I guess the lateral firefighters is the best way to go right now.
Agent: But is there anything that you're currently doing to kind of work on that recruitment piece in your department?
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Well, here in [GPE-1], I don't know if you know, we have CalJack with a organization that's kind of ran by the state, not ran by the state, but they're funded through some organizations which is statewide recruiting and you join that as a group or whatever.
EndUser: This is going to be [DATE-4] of fully members of that. So I moved that way to... to become part of that group and then a little more of a statewide reach.
EndUser: I guess some folks from [LOC-1] come north. if possible.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And dangling the care of the fact that we don't transport or do ammos transport out of my department. I'm a private contractor.
EndUser: So you get tired of riding in on the hospital and hanging out in the hospital for [TIME-3]. Come work here. So yeah, it's actually worked pretty well [DATE-5].
Agent: Oh, okay. Well, yeah, I'm glad you transitioned that way. I know that's anything that can do to get more, any more staff in those departments. I know it was definitely needed. That's perfect.
EndUser: Mm hmm.
Agent: I'm glad you have that in place.
Agent: I know, is there anything else kind of top of mind in your department after static curiosity just around communication amongst your team or just reporting on incidents that are going on within the city?
EndUser: Hmm, I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I mean, as far as that goes now, we have radio communications are fine in this way area, but the, and then we've gone to some apps where there's active 915 and crew force that most all of our guys now have on their cell phones, even on their personal ones, that folks can see what's going on and what's happening on the other areas of the city.
EndUser: So I want to say I worked out pretty well.
Agent: Perfectly, I'm glad to hear that. That was going to be that nice point there, is that just what we've been doing with other local fire departments, police departments is being able to really track in real time.
Agent: Any incidents that are going around or anything through the mobile apps and stuff like that as well. But yeah, thank you for sharing that information. That was helpful to kind of gauge where your department's at.
Agent: I know it sounds like everything's running pretty smoothly there. Is there anything that's...
Agent: Anything like top of mind or like a pain that you're trying to solve right now within your department?
EndUser: No, not really. I'm going to raise a strategic planning session here with the labor and the management side of things. in [DATE-6] and we'll see where we go from there.
Agent: Okay, yeah, perfect.
Agent: Well, yeah, but let me throw out a sense just from where everything sounds like with Caljack everything something you have the recruitment piece down pat if there is any interest in Learning a little bit more about what [ORG-1] does.
Agent: In that regard, we take the whole employee experience from recruiting all the way to retirement. I know it sounds like just the recruitment side is where you would be focused if you had any interest in that.
Agent: And if you ever do want to learn a little bit more about [ORG-1], above the, have a little introduction with one of our specialists to kind of go over some of the other use cases that we see with other departments.
Agent: Is that something that would be of interest And then [DATE-7], or is that something you'd want to do after you finish your strategic planning?
EndUser: Yeah, it'd probably be after the strategic planning and after [DATE-8].
Agent: Mm hmm.
EndUser: Piece here is up here in [DATE-9] where I can cut these guys loose with some other things to look at and just let's finish up [DATE-8] and then prepare for the next one.
EndUser: So it would probably be something more late summer because we'll have, we're actually opening up our recruiting in [DATE-10] and then we won't even really need you know four or five positions.
EndUser: So it's not a, we're not a big department. So by [DATE-10] we'll have our recruiting open, by [DATE-9] we'll have it.
EndUser: They're starting down the path of those being selected, getting a background, and then, you know, then a process for training in [DATE-12].
Agent: Ive
EndUser: Then we start all over again in, you know, in [DATE-12].
EndUser: So, probably more of the, yeah, these guys, after the recruitment piece is done and they get these people in, but to the seed in the academy, it's probably more of a late summer conversation to bring these guys back together and see how they're recruiting.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, I totally agree.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: I think it sounds like a good process.
Agent: I'll make a note to give you another ring here in [DATE-17] after all those after you get through the recruiting and strategic planning just to see how it went and see if there's anything else that you could maybe explore for your department.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Just second go. Okay.
Agent: But I can show your time and information that I was really helpful to get an understanding of the department.

EndUser: He had called me up related to some new features that were rolling out and we were having a little bit of conversation about that.
EndUser: However, I know you guys are more like a CRM type company and that sort of thing.
EndUser: And I was kind of clear with him that [PERSON-1] is not in a position to change our [PRODUCT-1], but I was interested in just that new feature that he was kind of talking to me about.
EndUser: And so we tried to set up a call about that. And when that dropped off, then I started getting calls just about CRM conversion. And that's not what we're about right now.
Agent: Sounds like maybe [PERSON-2], [PERSON-2] and you hadn't really bridged that gap on the product, be sure that you was alluding to, is that correct?
EndUser: Basically, yeah.
Agent: Okay. Well, I think maybe what [PERSON-2] was getting at, and I think you may be aware of this.
Agent: You know, everybody knows sales forces are flagship product with [PRODUCT-1], but, you know, over [DATE-1] we've sort of consolidated a lot of our products and services into, you know, a number of different areas.
Agent: So really, we're primarily a partner for your guys overall data strategy.
EndUser: Uh-huh.
Agent: I mean, we have several very large clients that use other CRMs, and we kind of come into different areas, whether it be service, marketing, you know, API data integration.
Agent: So I think maybe [PERSON-2] was just trying to see if there were maybe any other projects around your guys overall data strategy as a whole of the credit union.
Agent: I guess with that being said, [ORG-1], is there maybe any other ongoing visual initiatives that you guys have outside of just [PRODUCT-1] at the credit union?
EndUser: Yeah. We always have things going on from the digital footprint. And that world is actually a little bit separate from me. So we have a CIO here at [ORG-2] that would oversee our digital footprint.
Agent: Sure. Yeah.
EndUser: I'm Chief Financial Officer. I don't know if you have that in the system or whatnot. So I can give you contact information for our CIO.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah.
EndUser: On that front because we're with [ORG-3].
EndUser: And he's the one that manages that relationship, knows kind of the ins and outs of that particular contract, that sort of thing, and has been tasked to kind of lead us on the digital footprint side of things.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, that would be great. And if you'd be willing to refer me over to them, I'd be happy to reach out to them and just kind of get a feel if it's appropriate to chat with them.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah. Sure. Yeah.
Agent: I did. I kind of had that question too. It's not very often that we speak to chief financial officers about their modernizing their infrastructure, their [ORG-4] structure.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: But one area of conversation that we do typically find with individuals like yourself is the topic of conversation around consolidating technology. So.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: You know, what we typically find, and I may preface with this, I work exclusively with mid-sized banks and credit unions.
Agent: And what we typically find is that they've got a number of different, you know, applications, platforms that they're using across various different departments.
EndUser: Okay. Yep.
EndUser: So.
Agent: And I guess my question with that, [ORG-1], is, has there been any appetite across the credit unions to maybe consolidate some of those applications and systems?
EndUser: Okay. Yep.
EndUser: So. Between our CIO and myself, we're actually really trying to make that happen. There's been a lot of resistance to it at [PERSON-1] for one reason or another, but we're trying to do that.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: In fact, like I've moved my entire accounting and risk management systems to pretty sizable divisions for our financial institution to our Dynamics environment already. And that has been successful.
EndUser: But the rest of the organization is kind of disparate to be completely honest with you. So, yeah, that's kind of where we sit [DATE-2].
Agent: Interesting. I appreciate you sharing that with me.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: And again, the reason I asked, I actually just got up a call [DATE-2] with their, I think they're significantly larger than you guys.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: They're a credit union based out of [GPE-1]. That's nearing [MONEY-1] and so assets, but they are, they're also using [ORG-3] [DATE-2] and they're working through their data Integration strategy.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So that's one particular area we like to focus in on with credit unions or size.
Agent: Is getting those different systems to talk to each other and lessening the amount of applications and systems that your frontline staff and your lenders and everything have to use to manage those member relationships.
EndUser: Absolutely
Agent: I would love an opportunity to chat with your CIO about, but I think a discipline, [ORG-1], that I know seems maybe a little bit redundant, but I'm really just hoping to, I guess, bridge the initial connection with you guys with your new account director, his name's [PERSON-3].
EndUser: Sure. Yeah.
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: So. Um, you know, while, while I know you, you said it's more so up your, your CIOs alley with these conversations.
Agent: I'd love to set up maybe [TIME-1] or so in [DATE-3], if you have some time to spare just to kind of get the lay of the land at the credit union and get you introduced to [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: How about this?
EndUser: Because I think really to have the conversation be valuable to both parties, you should start with [PERSON-5], our CIO. And I can give you his contact information right now, if you like. So his email is [ORG-5] at [GPE-2].
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: Ok.
EndUser: And his phone number, give me [TIME-2] here.
Agent: Sure. Hopefully I'm not eating too much into your [TIME-3] here.
EndUser: Don't worry about it. I'm often just always like crunching through work. So see here. Just want to make sure I give you the right extension here. So his number is going to be 1237-622.
EndUser: 0 that will get you direct to him.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Awesome. I will see if I can get in touch with [PERSON-5] just to make sure [ORG-1] is it okay if I let him know that you send him, you send me over to him.
EndUser: Yeah, absolutely. I'm going to let him know that to expect a call from you guys.
Agent: Wonderful.
EndUser: So.
Agent: Wonderful. I really appreciate it, [ORG-1]. I appreciate the insight on everything in the past conversations and With that being said, I'll let you get back to your day here.

* ""Is getting those different systems to talk to each other and lessening the amount of applications and systems that your frontline staff and your lenders and everything have to use to manage those member relationships"" (implying that the client may be hesitant to consolidate systems due to resistance from [PERSON-1], but the agent is trying to understand the client's willingness to explore this option).

These questions aim to gauge the client's willingness to consider consolidating systems and reducing the number of applications and systems used, which may alleviate concerns about the potential disruption or complexity of implementing the product or service.",Did the salesperson propose clear next steps? Did they ask for the sale or set a follow-up meeting?,"Yes, the salesperson proposed clear next steps.

Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And then we will definitely try to get something on the calendar. I'm going to tell you it's probably going to be in [DATE-2] because we're racing against the clock right now.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
Agent: And this is, and just, you can push back on this, and this is more of an offer than a request.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: But... The couple of things I just wanted to cover, obviously I sent this in the email was around, you know, just getting a more of a time liner on the schedule or licenses whenever you need those.
Agent: We can go ahead and just get a good distance for when those would be necessary.
Agent: And then the larger conversation that would probably require, you know, [TIME-2] of time, you're just getting game plan around, is, you know, what a kind of like a discovery around a potential, you know, [ORG-1] Replace and what that could look like with the financials of that could look like And how that could look in [DATE-2] And so those were the two things I wanted to touch on and there's just there's a couple questions around the [ORG-1] thing But if we could get that figured out here in [DATE-3] when we can hit our hit the ground running in [DATE-2] Um, but that was that was more the offer I was going to put on the table if that would make sense for you guys Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, I don't think we'll make any decisions on [ORG-1], you know, or [ORG-2] in the new, you know, [DATE-4] for [DATE-5].
Agent: Totally.
EndUser: I know I know it's great to hit the ground running and all of that, but.
Agent: Totally. Totally.

Agent: No, I think, yeah, no, I, that's definitely within expectations for us. Totally. No, I think, yeah, no, I, that's definitely within expectations for us.
Agent: I think it was more around even if you know where like when that renewal is for your [ORG-1], we can almost in [DATE-8] without talking to you more internally be like, okay, you know, if that's when the renewal is, then let's build out kind of like a map of discovery questions, et cetera, to present to you all in [DATE-9].
EndUser: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Yeah. I misunderstood the question.
Agent: So, no worries.
EndUser: So we just renewed [ORG-2], we just renewed [ORG-2] within [DATE-10], and we did the same thing.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
EndUser: We're on the same schedule with [ORG-1], so we did renew [ORG-1] as well. So we've got [PRODUCT-1] of [DATE-14].
Agent: Okay. Okay, perfect.
EndUser: Right now, I'm very, very focused on some of the things that I think we may have talked to you or another representative from your company about, and that was... Just making sure the data was tracking correctly between [ORG-1] and.
EndUser: And [ORG-2], which we did find some broken links. So we are working with [ORG-3] department on correcting all of those links as we speak.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So that's getting done now. The next step for me is really understanding the scheduler from [ORG-2] for the two wellness consultants.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: And then if it all sounds good, I want to get that done. But I'm not not.
Agent: Right, so it's like kind of priority number one.
EndUser: That's my number one priority, but it's not like I'm in a rush that I have to be, you know, doing it [DATE-14], you know, if I do it for [DATE-14], it's okay, you know, but that's my first priority.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Gotcha, that makes sense. And I guess just for our notes, and you even know like ball parkalized what you all even paying for [ORG-1].
EndUser: I have no idea. It's not the system that I, you know, [ORG-2] is a system that I'm in charge of because I have the sales and marketing team.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: [ORG-4] is more the [ORG-5] team, so I really could not tell you.
Agent: Right.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Okay, always we can touch on that in [DATE-2]. Again, that conversation was more around.
Agent: Kind of showing you what solution [ORG-2] has that could potentially replace [ORG-1] with a more user friendly solution and also some that plays up with other technologies.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: But it sounds like if we just meet up [DATE-11], that's probably best for all parties. Perfect.
EndUser: All right. Well, let's, let's get something on the calendar, but I would do that with [PERSON-1] because she's got access to my calendar as well. So let's, let's do that.

Speaker 3: If you're looking at a website
Speaker 3: It's easier just to show.
Speaker 3: So the pieces of data that are most important to us are obviously imaging in videos, one of the most important things, but yet very costly for vendors to get a lot of ideas on their product.
Speaker 3: So being able to do anything to get more images or videos is really important. Then So down here you have your product overview specifications. The romance, most people in the industry call this paragraph section your romance.
Speaker 3: And then down here would be the features and benefits. So, you know, it's like you can see here it's like, okay, they're they're telling you it's stainless steel, steel flavorizer bars.
Speaker 3: Well, if you don't know anything about [PERSON-1], you don't know what a flavorizer bar does and why it's important to you. So there's no benefit here. This is a good feature, but there's no benefit.
Speaker 3: And so that's to I kind of I am rewrite these into a more feature benefit.
Agent: Where chat could come and help
Speaker 3: So if I'm a consumer and I'm reading my website now, I'm like, why is that good for me?
Speaker 3: Okay, well, so [QUANTITY-1], I don't even know what [QUANTITY-1] is, like how thick is that?
Speaker 3: How thick should it be?
Speaker 3: You know, I was buying a battery.
Speaker 3: A portable battery for my daughter and I had to sit there and learn about portable batteries like And then I ended up buying the wrong one anyway, because right on the front of the package, it says you can't carry it on a passenger airplane and I'm like, well, now I'm a reader.
Speaker 3: That's when I was looking for that, I knew that, but it didn't say it. So it's, you know, that's the kind of thing.
Speaker 3: It's like what questions are consumers asking and are we answering those questions?
Speaker 3: And so that's really important. And we do most of that in here, but then the specifications are what we call attributes.
Speaker 3: So, you know, each of these are an attribute of the product and it's just broken down into specific pieces of data. So this is all stuff that we will review. Make sure it's correct.
Speaker 3: Make sure it matches the image, that the images match each other, that the data is, we have all kinds of rules on the front end. So this is our website, our portal that the vendors use.
Speaker 3: This looks very bad because I am a super user, so I have all kinds of rules. multiple things here. That's just because of the way I'm set up.
Speaker 3: Most people would only have maybe three or four things in each area to add a new item that would come in here.
Speaker 3: And so I'll just bring up.
Speaker 3: I'll do whatever since we were already in there.
Speaker 3: So you would bring up,
Speaker 3: They will come into this application that click Add, I don't want to do that because that takes forever. But just to show you some of the information they put in. So they'll select their taxonomy here.
Speaker 3: What type of item it is?
Speaker 3: Where from, you know, we have harmonized [PRODUCT-1].
Speaker 3: This is that description that we just saw, so the romance, and then all of those features, they can have up to 10 features. The price and packaging gets very into specific operational data on product.
Speaker 3: Being the [ORG-1] and such and then. All the compliance data.
Agent: There are quite a few questions here.
Speaker 3: It doesn't look like so many, but as soon as you answer yes to one of these, you'll have more breakout questions. So this is required on every item.
Speaker 3: If the item is coming from overseas, they would have to fill out the import. And then here's where you get into those selling attributes. And here's where you'd see specific rules.
Speaker 3: You can see some of the fields have drop downs. So they can only select from the drop downs. Some of the fields have like a field behind it like burner.
Speaker 3: So how many burners?
Speaker 3: Three burner. But then some of them will allow you to make a selection here. And then they can upload their images.
Speaker 3: I don't know why it's not going.
Speaker 3: All right, I'm stuck. I don't know why I'm stuck. But they would be able to upload their images for the item. And then relationships is replacement parts and accessories.
Speaker 3: So they can identify if there are pieces that need to be replaced within the product, then they would add those as well.
Speaker 3: Yeah, I'm getting a red X, but this item is done, so I don't know why I'm getting a red X here. So that's kind of how they go through the screen to add a new item.
Speaker 3: And then there's another screen where they can update their data. But, you know, I would love to be able to come in and be able to put in my information on, you know, maybe it's a [ORG-1].
Speaker 3: Um, maybe give it a website and have chat. Create that description and, you know, potentially put rules around that price and packaging. It's like, yeah, you mistype this or filling in whatever.
Speaker 3: It can possibly fill in based on what's already out there on the internet . Okay. Now, if it's a brand new item or a specific item, they won't, you know, they'll get less, but
Agent: Having a system that does that is a lot of what we're looking for. Okay. And just a quick question on the relationships tab.
Agent: I'm just curious, does this also feed into like your customer service team, where I thought, [PERSON-2] bought this grill and I had issues with it, I instead of maybe calling Whoever, first, I might have called like, you know, ACE hardware and I said, hey, I bought this girl, but there's this issue.
Agent: Is the information on the relationships tab also feeding back into managing like whatever warranty
Speaker 3: Options that whoever sets up with sales through [ORG-2] or.
Speaker 3: So warranties right now are done through attribution, but there is a warranty project which will have a whole different interface for and they'll be able to maintain their coming in [DATE-1], warranties through there.
Agent: So that's [DATE-2]. Into this portal solution. Yeah. OK. OK. Yeah, thank you for giving me that overview. This is really interesting.
Agent: I'm going to share this video in my notes to my [PRODUCT-2] and Surface It to maybe our website.
Agent: Our engineering team just to see what kind of feedback they have in terms of how we might be able to help support this.
Agent: I mean, immediately right away, I was like, my gosh, this would be such an incredible process to run on the [ORG-3] platform just because not only do we have a layer of intelligence and [ORG-4] already built into the platform.
Agent: So there's probably some really unique things that we could be doing, but even just the collaboration piece with your vendors and digitizing your processes internally, not keeping it so siloed necessarily into just this tool.
Agent: Where it's just kind of like capture information and where you're in the process of capturing the information but really looking at your processes beyond that What do you guys have to or what information is missing or how does this informatio n then pushed out to other areas of the business or brought into other pieces of technology like [PRODUCT-3] Other other technology that you guys need within
Speaker 3: Do in terms of a follow-up
Speaker 3: The business based on this information. So, um, yeah, and I know that's one of the things that we struggle with too is just.
Speaker 3: How do we get a new piece of information or something that a vendor needs to fill out and getting them to actually take action. Huge, huge problem for us [DATE-3]. I do have another meeting
Agent: That I've got to jump to so I do have to jump off, but I'll circle back with you when I got. a little bit direction, but thank you for the time.

Speaker 3: Hello.
Speaker 2: Hello, [PERSON-1].
Speaker 3: How are you?
Speaker 2: I'm fine.
Speaker 2: How are you?
Speaker 3: I'm good. Thank you.
Speaker 2: Perfect. Thanks you, thank you so much for taking time [DATE-1].
Speaker 3: No problem.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we probably don't need as much as we planned.
Speaker 3: Okay, thanks. I'm not sure the name is joined, honestly. She's not there.
Speaker 2: No, CNAB is not joining and [PERSON-2] is not joining.
Speaker 3: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But I mean, you have all the numbers. It's just a little bit to explain.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 3: Yeah, OK.
Speaker 2: Okay, so as we started the conversation about [WORK_OF_ART-1] event monitoring, I tried to explain that this is a skew which is based on your [DATE-2] AOV, so the contract size and it takes, if you take [WORK_OF_ART-1] [PERCENT-1] and if you take event monitoring [PERCENT-2], so you have three orgs, that's why I put the three prizes.
Speaker 2: This is there .
Speaker 3: Okay.
Speaker 2: So for you, I guess the most important work would be [ORG-1] [PERSON-3].
Speaker 3: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So we have there of course a higher price because there are more licenses there. So we have about 1,343 per month if you calculate it up in [DATE-3].
Speaker 2: It's about 13,000 and if we would just add on the whole contract, it's about 39,000. It's the same concept on all the orgs and yes. Thank
Speaker 3: You.
Agent: This is how this solution is commercialized.
Agent: So what is the first feeling when you see these numbers?
Agent: Is this something that is interesting for you?
Agent: It's something that is in the budget or
Speaker 3: Is something that you say, and I don't see really the value of the...
Speaker 3: No, when the slim, you know, I do we have the commitment for that. That means when you just the rest contract, explain me again.
Speaker 2: This is if [DATE-1], from [DATE-1] until [DATE-4] current contract, right?
Speaker 3: Until
Speaker 2: Exactly. Okay. And
Speaker 3: Of course it's annualized like the rest that you pay. It's not that you need to pay the lump sum now. But yeah, sure. Sure. This is something like we'll pay [DATE-5].
Speaker 3: If we start [DATE-6], we'll pay 10th of the year. So 13 and then [DATE-7], the 14.
Speaker 3: Yes, exactly. Yeah. Okay. No, I don't know. I don't know. Okay, because we will focus on our adoption. Let's see, adoption process or adoption monitoring. Then for sure, if we can monitor closely and we can add the value.
Speaker 3: And make action following that implementation, make action on [ORG-2] to be able to improve that adoption. Maybe we should develop the commercial path on our side.
Speaker 3: So it could be interesting, but it's difficult for us to... to evaluate with that the return on the I.
Speaker 2: Error
Speaker 3: But this is something that we need to assess on our side.
Speaker 2: So I
Speaker 3: Think that the figure is not, the [DATE-8] figure is not so high. That's not very low anyway.
Speaker 3: But this is something with
Speaker 2: We can discuss the team internally.
Speaker 2: Maybe what could also be interesting for you is to make a short contract because when you make a contract starting from [DATE-9], at the moment we can get 21 [ORG-3] licenses for free for [DATE-10] because this is also a good add-on on top because then you have a great reporting of the analytics
Speaker 3: And see where the adoption is taking place And if you..
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean.. .
Speaker 2: Sorry, the 31 [ORG-3], what does that mean?
Speaker 2: This is
Speaker 3: The
Agent: Analytics tool from [ORG-2], which analyzes
Speaker 3: Which
Speaker 2: Gives you the great
Speaker 3: Dashboards, pre-built dashboards, where you can see much more and have much more This is the wise, this
Speaker 2: Analytics... in addition to the thing.
Speaker 3: Yeah, usually,
Speaker 2: Yes, usually an analytics license
Speaker 3: Costs 183
Speaker 2: Ranks per user per month. But if we can find an agreement for event monitoring, even if you take a short term, we can give 42 license for free for [DATE-10].
Speaker 2: And this could be a cool use case to see in [DATE-10] of event monitoring.
Speaker 2: How did this work?
Speaker 2: How much value did you gain out of it ?
Speaker 2: And then you have an ROI
Speaker 3: And in the end you only invested about yeah, $[MONEY-1] for this evaluation.
Speaker 2: Okay, I think that we, not so clear to me, but I think that we have some analytical license, right?
Speaker 2: Few. You have not so many analytics license, but there is some already built in analytics, which is standard, of course.
Speaker 3: Honestly,
Speaker 3: This is a topic which we also wanted to look at the analytics part, but as we were focusing on event monitoring.
Speaker 3: Before deploying analytics part for everybody, okay?
Speaker 3: That would be, yeah, in the next stage, something that then we need to first of all to think of some content, you know, for now we don't know what to to suggest to our users if we deploy, if we want to deploy something.
Agent: We can foresee
Speaker 3: So we need, first of all, to review what could be the needs for our [ORG-4]
Speaker 2: To see in the analytics and have kind of a project for that.
Speaker 3: And we'll see later for that. Absolutely. This is just a chance for you to get it for [DATE-10] for free. I understand. Yeah. understand. Great. Okay, okay.
Speaker 3: Honestly, assuming that it is process quite, it's not so straightforward on our side to be honest, I'm not sure that we can sign something by [DATE-14].
Agent: The decision
Speaker 3: Okay. To be honest, because it is [DATE-10] then I'm not sure that will be in a position to try something by [DATE-14].
Speaker 3: So I assume that this maybe this figure will change a little bit, but it is something that we can discuss on with the team internally and I have to review that with [ORG-5] and [ORG-6] to be able to evaluate if you want to go
Speaker 2: On with this event monitoring. Sure, these figures are not changing. The only, what is changing the promotion of having [PRODUCT-1].
Speaker 3: Is that, well,
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. Okay. So this prices.
Speaker 3: You can work with
Speaker 2: You don't need to worry. Okay, great. Yeah, because, I mean, I cannot give you a pricing and tell
Speaker 3: You, okay, you need to sign in [DATE-16]. Yeah, okay. Okay, great. That's fine then. Thank you for that. Okay. That's interesting. Okay. I see in the in our budget one, what we can do with that.
Speaker 3: And yeah. So I'll let you know Okay.
Speaker 2: Quite soon, I guess.
Speaker 3: Quite soon, so... I don't know. The decision, okay, we can have some kind of decision on our side. internally from the client service team saying, okay, that's interesting. We'll do the process. We initiate the process.
Speaker 3: But at the end, it's not fully our decision because some people have to release the budget. So I guess that by [DATE-14], we will have discussed with the team, and after that, we'll do
Speaker 2: The process if the decision is positive.
Speaker 3: All right, great.
Speaker 2: So you let me know. And if there's any questions I'm here.
Speaker 3: In the meantime, OK, good. Thank you very much. Have a great day.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
EndUser: All right. So I'll share my screen.
EndUser: Sorry.
Speaker 2: I'll take your time.
EndUser: Google Meet other people.
EndUser: All And so currently this is for our sales team.
Speaker 2: Right. Cool.
Speaker 2: And
EndUser: The kind of the tricky thing for us is, We have a lot of steps within each lifecycle stage. We call them tasks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
EndUser: However, they're not always chronological or sequential. So it's not like you do one and then the next and the next or the next. So within each lifecycle stage is kind of like a bucket.
EndUser: So we're using the general Marketing qualified leads, sales qualified lead opportunity buckets. And within each one, we have these different tasks. And you can hop around and do it out of order.
EndUser: But once you've, and the thing is you don't have to finish all of them to advance to the next one either.
Speaker 2: Then
EndUser: There's times where, obviously, right, if you can call once and get them, then you're out.
Speaker 2: Ok. And
EndUser: Then even with these pieces, as you're trying to get some more information to pre-qualify them, Sometimes you can skip some and you can escape to the next one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
EndUser: And it's No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Always in [PRODUCT-1] like this?
EndUser: This is just a representation So in [ORG-1].
Speaker 2: Of what I did in [ORG-1]. these are the stages
EndUser: These are the tasks in [ORG-1]. So this is just a spreadsheet representation of it. HubSpot can't handle this very well.
Speaker 2: So...
EndUser: They are pretty rigid with... you kind of need to complete everything.
Speaker 2: Right,
EndUser: Or it just clutters don't want all the old tasks still populating each context view.
Speaker 2: Everything. And so like when we're able to escape it, we
EndUser: It's just not as clean as it could be. And then reporting, it's pretty bad too.
EndUser: So I want to be able to track, you know, with each salesperson, right, how quick they're moving through all this where they're stuck, all those things.
EndUser: And so is pretty limited to we're using tasks, we're using lifecycle stages, we're trying to make it very easy to use with the sales team, from a UI standpoint.
Speaker 2: The reporting
EndUser: And so concept of right having things that are out of order don't have to be complete, but once you click enough of them, you can move on to the next one.
Speaker 2: This
EndUser: Yeah. And we do like the [ORG-1] right [TIME-1] it starts off [DATE-1] with the sales what tasks are left on their plate.
Speaker 2: Tasks because
Speaker 2: Guys and they know exactly
EndUser: And the way it's to them and they can
Speaker 2: Kind of presented organize it, that's all great. Just in our concept here,
EndUser: It's been kind of a struggle.
EndUser: So And do they have like a dashboard that they log on to every day and then they see all of those tasks on there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so there's,
EndUser: Yeah, there's something that they can see all of their own. I think right now, and this is something we just implemented recently, so we're still working it out.
EndUser: But as I mentioned, all of those old tasks that were completed, even though someone escaped to kind of the next stage. Those all still stick around. And so for see there are 24 tasks here.
Speaker 2: One contact, you can
Speaker 2: It's not useful for sales kind of see you can ask for each person just kind of hovering there. And they can't really tell what's the priority. So. No, definitely. I see that every day.
Speaker 2: So I totally, I get it. Definitely something that can be simplified with sales force.
Speaker 2: As far as like customization and things, did you, did you implement [ORG-1] or did you guys have someone do it or you did it all yourself?
EndUser: Yeah, we set it up. I said it on myself. I'm sure I probably missed some things, but Yeah, we're not doing anything too fancy
Speaker 2: Okay Yeah, then I definitely think, because like I said, I mean, you can get, you can start pretty basic with sales force, but then you can also get very high customization out of it.
Speaker 2: But it's, it's obviously, you know, up to you on how much you want to do. And then that would, you know, as it gets more complex is when I recommend working with an Implementation partner.
Speaker 2: But if you were able to implement [ORG-1] in a way that you guys are using it without too many customizations and I would say. that you can definitely take on [ORG-2] as a project as far as implementing .
Speaker 2: But I definitely want to get you in front of a demo just so you can see it and kind of see how it works and then we can highlight kind of how exactly what you just showed me, how it would look in [ORG-2].
Speaker 2: And then, yeah, kind of go from there and see if it makes sense to kind of see how it would work in your day to day.
Speaker 2: How many people or how many sales reps do you have working in these lines of business, like how many are using [ORG-1].
EndUser: It's all single digits. We're pretty small. So we're a direct consumer. We have [DATE-2] salespeople to kind of manage the exact people coming looking at it, trying to manage.
Speaker 2: Like looking at dashboards and stuff.
EndUser: Performance.
Speaker 2: And then we have
EndUser: One other kind of contractor who helps us set a few things up every now and then. So yeah, it's all single digits. And then health care person, it's just me.
Speaker 2: For the Right now. OK. Hi. Cool.
Speaker 2: And then for the other line of business, the fund, how many are using that?
EndUser: It's also just, I mean, it's, to three people.
Speaker 2: Okay.
EndUser: So everything is single tools.
Speaker 2: Okay. Yeah, because I saw that. I think that contract is coming up in [DATE-3].
Speaker 2: Would you say that that's where these other business lines would also be aligned on that same timeframe?
EndUser: No, we're all on different.
Speaker 2: Different?
Speaker 2: Okay. No problem. Well, I definitely want to get you in front of a demo.
Speaker 2: And then also, if you think it would make sense, I would love to have whoever kind of manages that fund business line to look at it as well and just kind of compare how it's different
EndUser: Than like the packaged product that they're using of [ORG-2]. If I can add them to that call as well, that would be awesome.
EndUser: Yeah, I can reach just check with them.
Speaker 2: Out to him. Let me touch anything right now.
EndUser: I feel like they probably don't want to Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, Set up our meeting and then I can reach out to him. Okay, and we'll record it too, so we can always send that off. And if they think, you know, it's worth looking at.
Speaker 2: I always just ask because I know that through all of our different resellers, I'm just curious to see how differently they're just came to [ORG-3] and how much more they can get out of the product by just being direct on [ORG-2].
EndUser: Using it if they
Speaker 2: But we can definitely record that.
EndUser: What does your schedule look like [DATE-4]?
Speaker 2: [DATE-5] I have three. One to three central. You're in central time. Go ahead. So I'm in. I'm on [LOC-1]. So that's 10 to one. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all make something work between 12 and one and I'll send you a calendar invite with my solutions And then I'll share with her this recording.

EndUser: Yeah, realistically, I think you're heading on the right track of focusing on our supply chain right now.

EndUser: Hey, how's it going [PERSON-1]?
EndUser: Sir, I'm late. Well, you could hit. I'm a...
Agent: My current situation check this out. So we got. Massive. Hi. And then [ORG-1]. And a lot of snow. Oh, man. We got to work from home day, [ORG-2] situation going on. So nice.
Agent: I'm going to be bouncing, but I'm listening. Oh, no, you're good. Yeah, dude. Thanks. Thanks for. Thanks for. Coming on, I know this is like our check in and see what's up.
Agent: Any news updates, thoughts, questions, concerns from your side.
EndUser: So for my side, what I do know is we're not going to go and do a separate sub org. So so that one's not going to be the case. I'm still trying to.
EndUser: Answer questions and get through a few things of trying to see whether or not they want to just expand licenses.
EndUser: So what I would say in the meantime is because this will help me because I'd mention to them I was like all right well we could probably get a discount if we need to add those licenses like a one time right.
EndUser: So for the sake of argument let's let me do the quick count here real quick while we're on the phone.
EndUser: One, two, four, [DATE-1], [DATE-2], ten.
EndUser: 10, go ahead and do around 22.
EndUser: Why?
EndUser: So, so 176 got it. Okay. It's not a niche. Yeah, do that.
EndUser: And then you will have a new product manager talk to you [DATE-3] is what what?
EndUser: So let's look at 22. Honestly, the way they're moving with it. I would say my.
EndUser: My gut reaction is then making a decision by your end of year.
Agent: Slim [PERCENT-1] confidence, right?
Agent: Maybe with [DATE-4] that I have now. And right now I'll take that. No, all good, man.
Agent: And you know what?
Agent: So I talked to, I did talk to my boss and I did talk to [PERSON-2]. So I talked to [PERSON-2] and I talked to his boss, [PERSON-3].
Agent: And when we discussed what's going on with PMA, and I mentioned the conversations we had earlier with, You'll potentially just Service Cloud instead of health cloud.
Agent: [PERSON-3] was like, hey, you know, if they just need service cloud, give them service cloud. That's all good. So we can do that as well. If you want me to spin up like what Service Cloud costs to now.
Agent: With Service Cloud, it would have to be Unlimited edition. We don't do different tiers of editions, but apparently we do different licenses.
Agent: Now, the only drawback to that is that if in the future, it's determined that they need to get onto health cloud, that's like its own separate implementation, basically starting from scratch.
Agent: Well, it is, I don't want to say it's not impossible. It happens all the time.
Agent: But it's a little bit more work to go from Service Cloud to health cloud than it is just to start off on health cloud to begin with.
Agent: So would you like me to send you both numbers for 13 licenses of Service Cloud and both numbers and the other number for 22 licenses of health cloud.
EndUser: Just go with licenses at the moment trying to try to convince them and get clear answers on feeling confident on the cloud piece and not redoing work. I just talking with one of my leaders.
EndUser: I was like, let's just keep it simple. I love it.
EndUser: Either either bring it into [ORG-3], right?
EndUser: Our current [ORG-3], because they know give them more functionality to build on long term, right?
EndUser: You can build the permission. You don't want us if you don't want that. You didn't see it. They don't have to see your <inaudible>. Yeah.
EndUser: But at this point, it's one where it's like, man, we're just, we're going to keep that one simple and I'm just going to give, give them basically like, Hey, here's what we need to make decision on.
EndUser: Here's an opportunity we can take.
Agent: If we still need more time to make the decision, cool. It's just this pricing will change. Just that's the impact.
Agent: Right?
Agent: Yeah. And the one caveat or just something to keep in your mind is when you move on [DATE-5], and you have an AE and you go to the new [ORG-4], you're like, hey, we need 47 more licenses.
Agent: We're growing like crazy. We need more health club. With this one time discount, this is not a negotiating tool. This is not like, well, [PERSON-1] gave us this one time discount.
Agent: Can we just get all of our licenses at this discount?
Agent: That's not the way it works. So while I think when your contract is up in [DATE-6], yeah, you can use it at that point.
Agent: Like that's when you can get to renegotiate a straight across price for all your licenses, but add on licenses will have to be its own separate. equal to a new negotiation .
EndUser: At that time, that's all.
EndUser: Because they're all, they're additional add-ons, right?
EndUser: I mean, they're all just,
Agent: And this is stupid end of the year discounting. Like this is not like your normal. Yeah, right, right. This is straight up like,
EndUser: We get in what we can get in. We give you guys the farm as best as we can and we call it a day and then we just go on like normal business [DATE-5].
EndUser: So I just want all these secured, you know that so I'm not <inaudible> over my counterpart. Oh, absolutely. No, no, completely agree.
EndUser: So yeah, so no, let's do that then let's plan on 17 Yeah, I'm just trying to double check in my mind that there's not any staff from the [ORG-5] I'm leaving out.
EndUser: And listen, if you need to add two more, you add two more in your current price, no big deal. Yeah. You know, we can do 17. We can do 10. It's.
Agent: We can manipulate on the fly. No problem. I've heard that time is in [TIME-1]. No worries. You and I have two other customers that I'm working on some stuff with.
Agent: So give me like an hour or [TIME-2] to send you that information over. It'll be preliminary approvals. So I'll probably get approvals from like [PERSON-2].
Agent: And then when we thumbs up from you guys, then I'll submit for final approvals. OK. For preliminary approvals, basically, mean final approvals is just more people. I have to convince that this is a good idea. Yeah.
Agent: So yeah, but give me a. Give me a little bit of time. I'll send that stuff over to you.
Agent: Okay, sounds perfect How are you the freaking best man?
Agent: Make sure your flexibility do that. Appreciate it Of course, of course. Thank you. You've had the flex around me. So both ways there Happy to do it. It's way worse. Take it easy.
Agent: Have you guys gotten any snow ?
EndUser: No, no, we got a lot of rain. No snow. I know [GPE-1] got hit pretty hard. We're getting kind of like the top end of that. Cool. And so thanks again, man. Of course. I appreciate everything, dude.

Speaker 2: That you are talking about. And maybe this can be used in next calls or next opportunities or next other objects within [ORG-1]. So this very good point you're bringing up about compliance and privacy regulations.

Speaker 2: While you're paying a fee for
Agent: That's great news. That's good. But that's not the only thing. So I'm sorry, but you can't buy conversation insights as an end all only, but it's included in [ORG-5] part. And then it's included with [PERSON-1].

Agent: Hey, this is [PERSON-2] calling from [ORG-1] on a Recorded line. You have a just admitted to chat.
EndUser: Uh, sure.
Agent: We have, I just got moved over to the patch and your account [ORG-2] solutions is you haven't seen much activity from the previous account owners and whatnot.
Agent: So I want to see if You wanted to have a brief chat over how you guys are using the software where we can maybe turn on some things turn off some things for you guys.
Agent: I thought you might be a good person to reach out to.
EndUser: No, probably not. I would consider myself a more typical user or two admins who handle all of the turning on, turning off of different settings and stuff would be [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4].
Agent: [PERSON-3].
EndUser: I can give you their [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4]. I can give you their contact information if that would help.
Agent: Got it. No, I think I have those names sound familiar. I could probably look them up unless you have like maybe like phone numbers.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: I just have their emails.
EndUser: Oh yeah. Yeah. Once I let me pull up the number.
EndUser: I'm sorry, I emailed an actual signature.
EndUser: Okay, phone number. Wait, I'll just give you which one is this.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: All right, for [PERSON-4], we got 500-784-4199.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And then you have her email, which is [PERSON-5], Abby.harper at [ORG-3]. Okay, and then [PERSON-3] is...
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: 3
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. 36.
Agent: And how are you fine?
Agent: Just before I let you go, how are you finding the software?
Agent: Do you find it's helping you in your day to day as a productive is slowing you down things you'd like to improve on it. Yeah. Right.
EndUser: I find it pretty good. Sometimes the information overload just on the amount of visible.
EndUser: Just like looking at an account, like an account, I'm not good with the name, but looking at an account like a customer is just sometimes there's a lot of information and you're only looking for one thing or a lot of the cells are empty.
EndUser: And you just a lot of a lot of blank data.
EndUser: So that's the only thing that's kind of a negative, but we use it for a lot of our updates and Price increases and that's been pretty handy because we can all as a group see a dashboard.
EndUser: Yes, different people get assigned different things and we have good visibility on that. So that's been good.
Agent: Right, right. Yeah, I know what I first joined here as well. I was like, oh, my other so many things to like focus on.
Agent: And then there's really like three or four cells that you're really kind of updating in your day to day, right?
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah.
Agent: Is there anything that maybe you wish you could do that would maybe improve your Workflow or anything like that?
Agent: Because this is all be great to kind of discuss in the [PERSON-6] and [PERSON-4] from like a user perspective.
EndUser: Um. I wish I could do different.
EndUser: I think the one thing that we struggle with switching from another provider with some of our day-to-day tasks is it's hard to have a Like a task list that's not associated to an object if that makes sense because like we have customers and that customer has a customer ID And then under that customer we could have hundreds of thousands of individual sites And we need to change site number five.
EndUser: Well, the field force doesn't seem early. It's not that we found have a good solution of, like here, the task for this customer. Site number this assign it to [PERSON-1] to fix this.
EndUser: Because if everything is connected, there's not a good way for us to create those kind of throw away tasks without connecting it to a bunch of other stuff that it doesn't really need to be.
Agent: Right. Got it. And you said switching from another provider, like you've had something that kind of solved this issue in the past.
EndUser: No, we just have a shared right now. We use smart sheets as a shared kind of like [PRODUCT-1]. But it's just a shared document that we can convert into forms and different dashboards to track that kind of stuff.
EndUser: So that way our customers Support teams can just fill out a form and it feeds into that spreadsheet which then gets assigned to one of our team and then we go and it just stuff off when it's done.
Agent: Got it.
Agent: Right. And this would be like a ticket.
Agent: Is that kind of what you're referring to?
EndUser: Yeah, very similar to a ticket system.
Agent: Got it. Okay.
Agent: So just to clarify, just so I understand this right, you're saying sometimes assigning like you have like a dash of like a bunch of tickets, but it's hard to sign to the right contact company or whatever it might be.
Agent: You kind of just have this list. So you're doing something externally currently to try to get by them through that.
EndUser: Kind of, yeah, it's more like under an account, there's the individual location information that really doesn't need to be tied to the parent account. It's just like in a ticket format.
EndUser: It doesn't, at least that, you know, I hear from [PERSON-7], who are actually the one setting this up.
EndUser: I've heard that there's not a good format right now for us to convert that and they can explain it better.
Agent: Thought it. Got it.
EndUser: They know more about the verbiage than I do.
Agent: Okay. Got it. Okay. Perfect.
Agent: [PERSON-1], is there anything else that I should know about or is that basically it?
EndUser: Nope, that's basically it. I'm just a user.
Agent: Awesome. Well, thank you so much.
Agent: If there's anything in the future that you ever need, you want me to shoot you over an email?
Agent: Just you have my contact information so you can, you know, run any ideas or suggestions or even if you need something turned on or off.
Agent: The rest are you think you're fine and just go through the dash and [PERSON-4], whatever you prefer.

006084_167_6qr3y000000oe3ZAAQ,"Agent: Hi, [PERSON-1]. Thank you for your time.
Agent: I literally I think, no more than 10 minutes, right?
EndUser: Will only take,
Agent: So I think you're on top of the detail already.
EndUser: But let me just
Agent: Show my screen with you. Sorry, just back in a moment. I've got a huddle coming through at the same time. Right, here we go. Back to this. OK, so I want to take you through.
Agent: You already know, right?
Agent: You're on an ELA structure, which means that you have a [ORG-1], a good faith estimate, a number of users that you've contracted to.
Agent: And then if you go upwards, it doesn't really matter in the sense that you're, that's the benefit of being on an ELA. You can continually go upwards if that's the case up and down.
Agent: And you won't get invoiced during that period until the end. end of that renewal when it comes to renewal at the end of that time . So you're aware of that and I'm sure [PERSON-2] is aware.
Agent: Is that right?
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, that's not all known information.
Agent: Yeah, cool. Okay, so we've got one option as you've known, I've said it from the start actually to potentially just keep over renewing as is.
Agent: So this is sticking at the current [ORG-1], which is with the [PERSON-3] same discount, [PERCENT-1], and the details you can see towards the right hand side of this screen.
Agent: We are negating or effectively not implementing the [PERCENT-2] price uplift that is included in your [WORK_OF_ART-1] essay.
Agent: So just as a note in case [PERSON-2] is sort of looking at this, suggesting that the price s are increasing, absolutely not, we are not going to do that for staying as is .
Agent: Now this other option here, so this is our second option that [PERSON-4] referred to when we all spoke, over to a [DATE-1] ELA.
EndUser: Is moving
Agent: So it basically looks at your usage every quarter and [PERSON-5] you up as you go. So you can see some index of numbers here. So currently we see over at [DATE-2] users
EndUser: And so
Agent: Hypothetically speaking, if it comes to [DATE-3] and you're at [DATE-4] users, that's when [ORG-2] would throw up. And as you can see at [DATE-5] and onto Q4.
Agent: So that's another way that we can contract [DATE-6] at a lower starting point, which is the [DATE-2]. Now, I'll move over to here. So this is our QELA option. Few things [TIME-1].
Agent: So the [ORG-1] is starting lower than the 2144 as it is [DATE-6]. The discount has dropped. And... That then will obviously reduce your total contract value.
Agent: Now, still guests have reprised this because the [ORG-1], the initial commit is lowering, that has decreased, and therefore they have changed the discount.
Agent: So there's a slight increase per user for [ORG-2], but it's still less than [PERCENT-3] in the [ORG-3].
Agent: And as I mentioned, this is a [DATE-1], [DATE-1] true-dup model. So that's how we would do this option.
EndUser: Now, Just [PERSON-2] will ask if it's true down as well as up.
Agent: No, so it is just a true-up model. We do not go backwards.
Agent: So if you look here, so if you start off at [DATE-2] and you do increase to [DATE-4] at [DATE-7], that will be the new. GFE number that we're working off of.
Agent: So if you go backwards again to [DATE-2], then you can absolutely do that, you can go downwards. However, the new contracted start point will be the higher number [DATE-4].
Agent: So [ORG-4] is a usage model and it's all to do with your usage as opposed to consumption like Service Cloud and [GPE-1].
Agent: I know that those contracts are slightly different and [PERSON-2] would have seen that there are options to potentially true down with those models.
Agent: I think you and I have spoken in the past, right?
Agent: If [ORG-2] did want to true down, we would need to see that active usage, the true active usage lower yes.
EndUser: Completely. Yes,
Agent: Yeah, so hence why we're starting lower than the 2144 right now for this renewal because we can see that you're lower in active usage.
Agent: So that base line to start of your new usage and you know if if [PERSON-2] says that users are you know what's the word we're looking for like you're making a large chunk of the workforce redundant.
Agent: I guess question for you. How many of those users sit within your tech dev community that currently use [ORG-4].
Agent: Do you see that they're going to be impacted?
EndUser: Wow, we have just had redundancy is announced but not many however they are all within the tech product tech and there's too many things but if there are any further I mean I'm not sure how on the actual [ORG-4] linkage yeah I think that we just have to have
Agent: Much of an impact that would have
Agent: To wait and see what actually happens there if it does happen okay all right that's cool So that is the information we're going to share. There's two options for renewal.
EndUser: Do you think [PERSON-2] will have any other questions for us?
Agent: I've I'm sure you will.
EndUser: No idea.
Agent: Yeah. I'm not sure. I couldn't personally, [PERSON-4] and I couldn't think of anything glaringly obvious that we've missed in how this is positioned with the two options. I think I've mentioned to you in the past.
Agent: The fact that we can't do too much here because Ovo are using, actively using [ORG-4]. If you weren't, then that would open up a few other options for us potentially.
Agent: We're not in the same boat as [ORG-5] and [GPE-1]. We are giving you the options that we're able to. So two options. you know, stick with the ELA, everything as is, or move to [DATE-1],
EndUser: Which gives you some extra flexibility . Perfect. Okay, that works for me. I don't think you'll have any questions,
Agent: But I also know that he won't hesitate to ask him if he does.
Agent: That's true, right?
Agent: That is true. Okay, well, look, thank you so much for your time. We'll make sure this is over to you, both you and [PERSON-2], and, you know, we'll touch base early if you've got any other questions.
EndUser: Part of [DATE-8] before [DATE-9] break, Brilliant.
Agent: Thank No worries.

The salesperson addressed these points adequately by explaining the ELA structure and the benefits of moving to a QELA, which would give the company more flexibility in terms of usage and pricing. The salesperson also acknowledged the potential impact of the redundancy on the company's usage and the possibility of true-downs, but emphasized that the company would need to actively reduce its usage to take advantage of this option. Overall, the salesperson provided clear and concise explanations of the contract options and addressed the buyer's concerns in a professional and helpful manner.",How did the salesperson use questions to delve into specific pain points and their impact on the client's business operations or objectives?,"The salesperson used questions to delve into specific pain points and their impact on the client's business operations or objectives by asking about the client's usage patterns, potential changes in their workforce, and the implications of those changes on their current contract. For example, the salesperson asked:

* ""How many of those users sit within your tech dev community that currently use [ORG-4]?"" to understand the potential impact of redundancy on their current usage.
* ""Do you see that they're going to be impacted?"" to clarify the potential consequences of the redundancy on their current contract.
* ""If you weren't actively using [ORG-4], then that would open up a few other options for us potentially"" to highlight the limitations of their current contract.

These questions allowed the salesperson to understand the client's specific pain points and tailor their pitch to address those concerns, ultimately presenting two options for renewal that took into account the client's changing business operations and objectives."

Speaker 2: Basically here's the report that we wanted to run and I will tell you that it was a standard used to be a standard report in Pardot before the Marketing Cloud changeover.
Speaker 2: Basically what we're trying to find out is we're going to be changing our model to a subscription model. So I need to know who my most engaged audience is.
Speaker 2: So I know how many contacts do I want to contact during the first initial wave of subscription offerings, right?
Speaker 2: So all we want is a report. I want to know who's open the click on my emails three times. two times and one time over [DATE-1].
Speaker 2: Should be pretty easy, right?
Agent: It's not.
Speaker 2: Apparently it's not. So this way, when I have that, yeah, that segment of my database, that's going to be my initial audience to offer subscriptions. They read our stuff more than anyone else. They click on stuff.

Agent: This. But I can't start
Speaker 2: And we know the data is there. We know there used to be a report that was very easy to run that would give us this information. Now we're in this tangled web of people popping us around.

Speaker 2: I didn't think it was that much of an issue to be honest with.
Agent: So what I can do from, okay. So essentially long and short, the biggest issue is, The frustration is you have a very simple request you're looking for.

EndUser: Hello, how are you?
EndUser: I'm good. Apologies. I don't have my camera on. I am in a coffee shop and hiding from my house. It's currently getting work done.
Agent: That's okay, no worries. I just wanted to hop on a call. So I spoke to my director. So [PERCENT-1] is typically for those that are over 84 users.
Agent: The team would only be willing to do [PERCENT-2] if you commit to 108 users. However, you're only at 58 right now.
Agent: Do you know what user count is going to look like over [DATE-1]?
EndUser: Um, I mean, we might have a hundred users in like, I'd say, probably believe since we're at 84 right now, right?
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: I would say by in [DATE-2], maybe at a hundred, maybe within [DATE-3], we should be, we would definitely be at a hundred, but I don't know that I'd want to pay right now for a hundred knowing that we're not there yet.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. No, and I totally get that. Typically, what we do is like we would allocate a good paid estimate.
Agent: So if you know that you're going to get to 90 in [DATE-4], we allocate 69, but we just don't do that extra 187.
Agent: So like you're not paying for the additional users past the 92 over the course of [DATE-5].
EndUser: Um,
EndUser: If that's something, sorry. So, um, sorry, I just want to make sure I understand. So like we would still pay how many users we have, assuming that we reach 102 by [DATE-6]. And then.
Agent: Or within [DATE-4] or whatever that is. And then once the 69 comes in, we would then start paying for them.
Agent: Is that right?
Agent: No, so you don't have to pay for them over the course of [DATE-5]. So let's say, for example, the contract, you signed a contract [DATE-7] with the 102 users.
Agent: You would have 89 users to use over the course of [DATE-5]. However, if you reached that threshold in [DATE-4] and then you said you had [DATE-8],
EndUser: You wouldn't be paying for any additional users over the course of [DATE-9]. We would basically come to you at the end of our new work.
EndUser: And say, okay, your threshold is at [ORG-1], at [DATE-10] what do you think that good faith estimat e should be moving into [DATE-9] You're not paying over the course of the yea r for the additional users past the 89 Got it.
EndUser: So essentially up front, I'm just paying for 82 users and then
EndUser: Yeah, hoping that you that you go past that almost. Because you're not going to be paying for additional users. Yeah. Got it.
Agent: Um, if you know that likely you're going to get to 86 users, um, typically that's, that's what people do. Otherwise with the discount if we are going to Do the discount it would be the 77.
Agent: Yes either [DATE-9] or 90 I feel look but it would be there it would be that and then we could do [PERCENT-3] that would be the highest we could do with the current amount of users you have now Okay, and with the hundred users it would be 33 or 33 did you say sorry?
Agent: Users, 33. Got it.
EndUser: Okay. Okay.
EndUser: And that would be just on the standard 108 cost, not on the actual atlas cost, right?
Agent: It would be off of correct. Okay. But then you're locking yourself in moving forward at [DATE-13], you're locking yourself in at that [PERCENT-4]. Thank you. Right. So there's just more incentive.
Agent: Yeah, when it comes time for renewal.
EndUser: I'm going to have to check our productions and see exactly how many users we're expecting to get to before I say yes. But this is helpful. I figured it was easier to explain over that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
EndUser: So, OK, yeah, that makes sense.
EndUser: And then for the 84 would be locked in at the rate or would it be incremental for every single person out for that at [PERCENT-5]?
EndUser: Do you know what I mean?
EndUser: Sorry. Okay. If with [PERCENT-5] would that be, we would be at like the 87 users and then that would be our [PERSON-2] until we're new. It comes the same kind of concept. Okay. Okay. Yes.
EndUser: So, so if you sign for a hundred, you're locking yourself in for 33 versus if you sign for or whatever 87, you're locking yourself in for 13. Yeah. Got it. Okay.
EndUser: Let me, let me plug around with my budget and then just see how many we're supposed to have. I'm sure.
EndUser: And can I get back to you on this tomorrow ?
Agent: Yeah, if that's okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I'll let my direct I was letting my director know anyway that we are hopping in a call to 33. So yeah, just let me know.

EndUser: I'm back to back before. So, so don't worry. Yeah, let me know if you have any questions. And then yeah, whichever you decide it's pretty it's. It's going to it'll be pretty easy to do either one. Okay. Perfect.
EndUser: That works. Okay. Cool. I will retract out your door then. Thank you very much. Sure. Yeah, of course. All right, perfect. Let me know if you have any other questions that come up. OK, cool.
EndUser: Oh, and I mean, I assume that this is accurate, but we already prepaid for a portion, whatever we haven't used yet, we'll get credited.
EndUser: Is that right?
EndUser: Correct. OK. And you guys could either put that toward the new invoice, or if you don't want to put that toward the new invoice, you don't have You would get a credit memo, yes.

EndUser: Hi, [PERSON-1].
EndUser: Can you hear me?
Agent: I can hear you.
Agent: How are you?
EndUser: How are you?
EndUser: Happy [EVENT-1], [PERSON-2]. My name is [PERSON-3]. I'm [PERSON-4]'s assistant.
Agent: Nice to meet you.
EndUser: Mm-hmm. Nice to meet you too. So, we're reaching out to see how, you know, we can reduce our cost in [ORG-1] or, you know, to get some sort of Enterprise plan.
Agent: Um, sorry, what do you mean Enterprise Enterprise plan?
EndUser: So I believe we're currently in a pro plan, but we have like 69 plus channels. And we would like, you know, to upgrade to another plan that would help us reduce our [DATE-1] costs.
Agent: Understood. So I just want to be completely on it, like a completely upfront that when you do upgrade, there always is an uplifting cost. But in terms of kind of structuring the contract, there could be more ability to
Agent: Kind of have a more cost-effective contract. But If you're upgrading your plan, there's always going to be an increasing cost for upgrading your plan.
EndUser: Oh, okay. Got it. So how do we, you know, reduce our costs considering that we have almost 94 plus channels and we're also adding more.
Agent: So there isn't a way, so there isn't a way to reduce costs if you're adding more channels. You're paying per user. So you're paying on a per user basis, not on a per channel basis.
EndUser: Oh, okay, got it.
EndUser: So would you be able to check how much is our currently cost for per user?
Agent: Sure, just give you one second.
Agent: And this backlands under [PERSON-5], [GPE-1], right?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: One second, it's just loading.
Agent: Okay, I see M and K and [ORG-2] is that.
EndUser: Oh, let me check. Yep.
Agent: That's so why. Okay. Um,
Agent: Okay, so you guys, I understand. So you're paying on a [DATE-1] plan. So you're paying more per user per year. Okay. So, let me just see, just give you one second. I'm just clicking into your plan.
Agent: And will you be adding any additional users over the course of [DATE-2]?
EndUser: Yes. So [PERSON-4] has a mentorship business. So we're adding maybe 10 to 11 per month.
Agent: Understood. Okay. Okay. I understand what you're referring to. So. Okay. So right now. you guys are paying $[MONEY-1] per user per year.
Agent: So if you were on an [DATE-3] contract plan, so right now you're paying per month, if you move to a [DATE-4] plan that would reduce to $[MONEY-2] per user per year.
Agent: However, when we put you on a [DATE-4] plan, what we do is we allocate something called a good faith estimate.
Agent: So we would take the amount of users you anticipated that you think you're going to add over the course of [DATE-2] and then become to like an agreement of what that number would be and then that's what you're paying for the course of [DATE-2] and you're paying for that front and then over the course of [DATE-2] if you add users your additional pass that threshold you're not getting charged They're not getting charged.
Agent: The only time you would get charged is when it came time for renewal. And we said, maybe, [PERSON-6], you went 43 users over your good faith estimate.
Agent: Now let's leave to start the user account at that and re-restructure the contract.
EndUser: Okay, go ahead, I gotcha.
EndUser: Will you be able to give me a sample computation so I can give it to [PERSON-4]?
Agent: Yeah, so.
Agent: So what we would need to do is so he's anticipating 10 to 11 users per month you said?
EndUser: Yes.
Agent: Okay. So, okay. So just assuming that we're putting a good faith estimate to the contract because we would need to put a certain user threshold upfront, I'm going to do as if we did users per month.
Agent: So we won't do because you're paying upfront for it. So don't want to do the full the full amount of the 21 because there's a compromise there for on a [DATE-4] plan. So you would do 10 times 11.
Agent: So it would be 108 users. Um, so we would do 97 plus right now you guys have. Okay. So right now, right now it looks like you guys are paying for 119 users.
Agent: But your [DATE-1] usage is 160. So you guys are way above that.
Agent: So it need to be plus 249. So it would be 97
Agent: Times 111. OK.
Agent: So eventually for the amount of users you guys, so right now you're not paying for the 167. Eventually the [DATE-1] user cost, you would have to pay for the 216.
Agent: I don't know if those were users were added over the course of [DATE-5] or do you know where that big jump would have come from?
EndUser: I'm not really sure. Okay.
Agent: So I would want to find out from [PERSON-4] of where that difference is coming from. Okay.
Agent: Because you guys are paying [DATE-1], but on a [DATE-1] basis, it looks like you have users, but the last [DATE-1] cost that you paid for was for only 124 users. Okay. Oh, so.
Agent: Yeah, so when we build that into the contract, we would need to build it in for your [DATE-1] after-view search,

EndUser: Hi, yeah, happy [DATE-3].
Agent: Thank you. Well, I'll be brief, but I'm aligned to [ORG-2] from like the fall business team here. And just notice that you had taken a look at one of our demos.

EndUser: Yeah, I don't have time [DATE-1] and I'm actually off on [DATE-4], but [DATE-5] sometime might be good.

EndUser: In order to get the Salesforce Mapping, which I saw is [MONEY-1] or something like that, Do you need to have a sales force license already in order to use it?

EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: What else?

EndUser: And the [ORG-1] mapping tool seems like a really good. way to do that. But we don't have sales force at the moment. And obviously,
EndUser: We wouldn't, even if we were to get sales force right this second, we wouldn't have time to implement it before they go on their strips.
EndUser: So that's why I'm wondering if it's something that we can use without a full-on license and just like inter-contact information.
Agent: Gotcha.
EndUser: And then obviously consider [ORG-1] down the line as a full license.
Agent: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, that all makes sense. What else do you let me go ahead and double check with only my counterpart.

EndUser: Okay. Uh, let me leave.
Agent: What do you guys turn?

Agent: Gotcha.
EndUser: But we are about ready to launch a inside sales team in [DATE-1].
Agent: Are you guys doing that?

Agent: And then what actually system are those in?
EndUser: And tell the guys.
Agent: Ok, gotcha. He wasn't sure. [PERSON-3] explained to me that cargo wife was doing the back end operation stuff.
Agent: But he wasn't sure from a sales perspective, so it's interesting that you guys have it all kind of combined into that.
EndUser: Yeah, we try and do that.
Agent: From an account management perspective where you have existing clients come in, and you're like, you know, fall at meetings, stuff like that, does your sales team have this ability into the day-to-day of their business with you guys?
Agent: So any problems they've run into, like, support tickets, stuff like that?

EndUser: Yeah, without a doubt. Yeah, we're all like one big happy family.
Agent: Gotcha.
Agent: That's good to hear. That's kind of similar. I don't know if I mentioned at the beginning, I came from a logistics background before I was doing this and it was the exact same right.

Agent: Yep.
Agent: And it sounds like too, like your kind of sales teams have their bandwidth pretty much full at this point anyway.
Agent: So even if you had a bunch of stuff coming in, there isn't possibly that much you could be doing with it.

Agent: Yeah, I gotcha. Well, it could be something of value just that way you could see, you know, we're working with other large logistics companies.
Agent: So maybe some ideas you could get from that maybe kickstart for when you do have that inside sales team. You've got kind of direction once they choose through those leads.
Agent: So it could be something we could keep it strictly information on just kind of walk you through what we have helped other companies in a similar situation we all saw.
EndUser: And you know what, maybe we should have a conversation at [DATE-3], as opposed to now, because get those people from running and really understand what they're capable of doing, then we can say, all right, well, you need help and explain the this is an avenue to do that.

Agent: So when you see that come through, you can just click accept on that for me just to make sure you got it.
Agent: Before that, do you have to be a coffee or a golf guy at all?

Agent: That's, Yeah, that's a great question. Let me let me go circle back with my team and you know come back to you with some instructions there.

Were they actively engaged in the conversation?,"The buyer was somewhat responsive during the sales call, but not overly engaged. They provided answers to the agent's questions, but didn't ask many questions themselves and didn't seem to be actively seeking more information about the product. The buyer's tone was generally polite and courteous, but they didn't seem particularly enthusiastic or invested in the conversation.","Overall, did the customer seem to bring up a lot of our competitor features compared to ours? Were any of them deal-breakers?","Yes, the customer mentioned a competitor, [GPE-3], and the representative from [GPE-3] helped the customer set up the desktop and walked them through some examples online. The customer also mentioned that the representative from [GPE-3] couldn't help them with connecting to the department of state on a Citrix server or a go server, which suggests that the customer is considering alternative options. However, it's not clear if the competitor's features were specifically mentioned as deal-breakers or if the customer is just exploring options.",Did the salesperson clearly explain how their product or service solves the prospect's problems and delivers value?,"No, the salesperson did not clearly explain how their product or service solves the prospect's problems and delivers value.

* How do I get connected to the department of state on a citric server on a go server?
* Is it available for the department?
* Is it approved on [PERSON-5]-wise?

These questions indicate that the client is concerned about the technical feasibility, departmental approval, and potential roadblocks in implementing the product or service. The sales agent acknowledges these concerns and agrees to circle back with the team to provide answers, which helps to alleviate the client's uncertainties and risks.",How did the salesperson use questions to uncover the root causes of objections and tailor responses to alleviate the client's concerns?,"The salesperson used questions to uncover the root causes of objections by asking open-ended questions that encouraged the client to share their concerns and needs. For example, when the client mentioned that they were looking for a dashboarding tool for their team, the salesperson asked ""What prompted your interest in using [PERSON-3] and you know how you're looking to move your mission forward with it?"" This allowed the client to share their goals and objectives, which the salesperson could then use to tailor their response and alleviate their concerns.

The salesperson also asked clarifying questions to ensure they understood the client's needs and challenges. For instance, when the client mentioned that they were having trouble connecting to the server, the salesperson asked ""How do I get connected in the department of state on a citric server on a go server?"" This showed that the salesperson was actively listening and willing to help the client overcome their obstacles.

By asking questions and actively listening to the client's responses, the salesperson was able to tailor their responses to alleviate the client's concerns and build trust with the client.","What was the overall tone of the call - was it positive, negative, neutral, aggressive, or passive?","The overall tone of the call was neutral, with a hint of skepticism and inquiry. The customer, EndUser, was polite and professional, but also seemed hesitant and unsure about the product and its capabilities.

Agent: Sure, of course, of course. Well, first of all, I just wanted to reach out to the team and offer myself as a resource if you have any questions or concerns about the platform on your guide.
Agent: But just want to understand if you and your team are using the platform and if you are if you have any feedback or that's positive or negative
EndUser: Yeah, so we are using it. I mean, our entire company is using the [ORG-3] platform, but [PERSON-2] missed our CEO. He would be the best one for you to speak with.
Agent: Sure. And I actually do have a call scheduled with him, I think maybe in [DATE-2] or two. So definitely get some information from him.
EndUser: Perfect.
Agent: But oftentimes I also like to just maybe call the folks that are using the platform on [DATE-3] basis just to get some feedback.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: You know, if it's if it's working great for you, fantastic, love to hear that.
Agent: But I think sometimes more importantly, if maybe it's not working as well as you want it to, or if there's some gaps, that you wish it could do something but it doesn't do.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: So really just want to make sure you're maximizing the platform.
EndUser: Yeah, no. No, I appreciate. I appreciate that. You know, I think it is working pretty well for myself and my direct reports.
Agent: Okay.

EndUser: We just say, Hey, This is what we're looking for and then he figures out the best way to make that happen in [ORG-3].

Agent: That's fantastic. That's really good to hear.
Agent: Is your team primarily a service team, meaning do you work with existing customers kind of on service tickets and resolving issues, or is it primarily more like a sales function?
EndUser: Um. Um, no, mine's probably kind of somewhere in the middle. My, I manage the team of benefit specialists.
EndUser: So they're handling [DATE-4] administration of benefits with our clients and vendor carrier management, but they're not handling tickets within the system like our help desk team does.

Agent: Okay.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: So our team.

Agent: Okay.
Agent: Got it.
Agent: So, so is your team client facing?
EndUser: My team is client- facing- <inaudible> unbiased internet computers now. So the more we're talking about this, I'm like, I actually have two teams. So my one team is client facing. My other team is not client facing.

EndUser: And they do not interface with employees. They do not interface with clients.
Agent: Sure.

EndUser: Yeah.

Agent: Either we don't know how or don't know if there's.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: If you have that capability because those are things that I can kind of flesh out for you and track down for you almost certainly if there's some type of function that you want to be able to do we can probably help with it so it's kind of helpful to know where those gaps are sometimes.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, I don't have any guests currently just because [PERSON-2]'s kind of that guy for us. So we take it to him and he he makes it happen or puts it on the on the list.

EndUser: Yeah, if you want to send us over kind of like the guide and the features you have on there, and pretty much the pricing, like what's your [DATE-2], just an average [DATE-2] pricing of your cheapest plan that kind of keeps track of just kind of like a point-man's and just following up and stuff like that.

Agent: Okay, well, yeah, I can tell you, I can give you some insight there, but I think it would be probably more of like, you know, further vet to get you the full idea of what that [PERSON-10] would look like.
Agent: I'll send some information and I'll attach some, maybe some times [DATE-1] that we can kind of see so I can get you aligned with them so they can talk kind of higher level discussion with you all.

Agent: Would that be okay with you?

005797_167_6qr3y000000g5hLAAQ,"Agent: So I built four options. One of them is for 49 [ORG-1] licenses, they're tabbed down here. 43 plus 43 enablement, 94 [ORG-1] and 87 plus 87 for [ORG-1] and enablement.
Agent: I'm gonna be quite honest, I'm getting a lot of pushback on the Enablement piece right now, I'm not sure that we'd be able to do it until [DATE-1], just cause it's not live in [ORG-2] yet.
Agent: So we might just wanna focus on these two, but I can still cover these at the end if you'd like.
EndUser: Basically
Agent: What this is, is this is your current investment with [ORG-3] up top. You spend 52.7k [DATE-2]. And then this is what we're proposing down below. So this would be everything that you have up top is exactly the same.
Agent: The only addition here is the, so I do the wrong like that.
Agent: I think I, no, it's right here. This is the only difference between the top and the bottom because this one's zeroed out here.
Agent: So there's So 49 community licenses at [PERCENT-1] discount would be $[MONEY-1] per user per month, [DATE-3].
EndUser: No loss there.
Agent: But when we scroll down here, your next contract anniversary date or your contract is up for renewal on [DATE-4] [DATE-5].
Agent: So if we make your early renewal essentially, [DATE-6], there are [DATE-7] [DATE-8]. You currently spend $[MONEY-2] on average per day that your current spend divided by 266.
Agent: So because you've paid all that money in advance and [ORG-3] hasn't provided you any goods or services for that time yet, we would actually owe you a credit of 17,426 approximately. [DATE-9] [DATE-7], [MONEY-3] per day.
Agent: The new contract amount would be 44,000. So that would increase your [DATE-10] spend to $[MONEY-4] per day.
Agent: It would take you [DATE-11] of spending $[MONEY-4] per day for that $[MONEY-5] credit to amount to zero. That would take us to.
Agent: [DATE-11], so the target step-end date would be [DATE-17]. We need it to be on full billing cycles. So [DATE-17] after the seventh would be [DATE-17].
Agent: So [DATE-17], you would only own $[MONEY-6] for that amount of time. So it'd be $[MONEY-6] total for 52 [ORG-1] licenses [DATE-17], and [DATE-17],
Agent: You get access to all of them immediately. And then instead of your contract renewing on [DATE-17], your contract would essentially renew on [DATE-23].
Agent: So it'd be up by [DATE-17] in order to get access to all of these [ORG-1] licenses now.
EndUser: Moving your renewal
Agent: Ok. That's the first option. Second option is same exact thing. So again, it's due format up here. Same thing down below, just 96 users. Instead, we were able to get [PERCENT-2] discount instead of a discount.
Agent: The dates are a little bit different. This is a start date.
Agent: And the reason why the dates matter is because it changes the approximate credit that we would be able to provide, and then the estimated date that would be zero.
Agent: So you can see if I change this to, I'll just say like the seventh of next month, then I would need to change this to the sixth. of [DATE-19] and then you guys would have $[MONEY-7].
Agent: So still not a ton of money, but to minimize it, it would need to have [DATE-23].
Agent: If I put it at [DATE-23], then I could move this to [DATE-23] and then we're at [MONEY-8]. So still not a ton, but like the dates do matter here.
Agent: And then the other options were 68 [ORG-1] and 75 Enablement and 144, sorry, 117 and 72. But that ranged from basically [MONEY-9] to that was [MONEY-10].
Agent: And all of them just move your, your renewal date [DATE-26] [DATE-31].
EndUser: To anywhere from like [DATE-26]
Agent: Do you think that would be more appealing?
Agent: I'm assuming you guys are planning on renewing with [ORG-3], you guys have invested a lot of time and money into building it up.
Agent: If you guys are planning on renewing, then this is essentially a way to get access to [ORG-1]. sooner and not really need to pay for it. It just moves up
EndUser: Your renewal by [DATE-34].
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, it's just anything involving adding tools right now is definitely tough, but I'll have to with the guys and see what the what the appetite is definitely, you know, we're locked in with the [PRODUCT-1], but you know between budget and then also we just recently gosh just [DATE-26] met with [PERSON-1], which is a good conversation.
Agent: Have the conversation
EndUser: He's kind of working on that [ORG-4].
EndUser: Um, but also it might take us to [DATE-26] just to even begin to realize value of, of [ORG-1], but I appreciate you putting it together and, and then, and working on some kind of sweet discounts.
EndUser: Um, it does make it more feasible, um, than, than if that wasn't the case. So, um, but let me just, uh, on [DATE-26] or run it by the guys and
Agent: We'll let's just follow up then. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks for allowing me to get creative. I is a whole other cost
EndUser: Know that the Implementation and with budgets and all that stuff. Yeah. So I don't even want total of that's going to be like It is what it is.
Agent: To see what the that. Yeah. You know, I get it. I want to go down without swinging. So I figured I'd give you guys the best deal I possibly can. And hopefully we get to work together [DATE-38].
EndUser: I won't know until probably [DATE-38]. So yeah, it's been great. Hopefully we can continue. You know, if not, you know, we wish it's not done, you know, yet, but yeah, it's been good.
Agent: You the best.
EndUser: Obviously And I know it'll be even better once we can kind of play around with some more things right now.
EndUser: A bit handcuffed and it's been [DATE-43] or so of trying to get new tools and [ORG-3] was a big purchase for us and yeah it's going to [DATE-26] if I can do this.

Agent: Ok. Yeah. The reason why I had reached out is because considering you guys are a [ORG-1] customer and [DATE-1] is coming up to an end.

EndUser: We just haven't really found a use case, if you will, to really start kind of implementing and utilizing it a little bit more.
Agent: Okay. I appreciate the transparency there.
Agent: And I assume when you say you guys aren't leveraging or utilizing as much, that's on the [PRODUCT-1] side, right?

007712_167_6qr3y000000sYbyAAE,"Agent: Create a push.
EndUser: It can be done this way either for emails, push notifications or SMS.
Agent: It just is one.
EndUser: Taking ages about that. So I'm here with the content, we have all the channels.
EndUser: Ok, so we have two options to use And you will to use the SDK that it's coming with customer.io.
Agent: Push notifications.
EndUser: In this case, we cannot use it because it's not implemented. We have push notifications enabled directly with [GPE-1].
Agent: Yeah, I understand.
EndUser: So we are using custom payload.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: In here, I have copied, I am pasting, and I have heard the message. And depending, for example, on the language, use the language ISO or [ORG-1].
Agent: We
EndUser: Let's see, for example, [LANGUAGE-1]. Automatically, it's here in the code. So the message is changed to [LANGUAGE-1], beauty of the code.
Agent: The
EndUser: So we only have to copy and paste all in one solution and we have the 15 languages ready with the right resist claimers according to the license.
Agent: Yes.
EndUser: And even we are creating, I have created this attribute which is license region. Yes.
Agent: And this
EndUser: Way we can even tailor our resist claimers depending on the license region. I have done the same with [GPE-2]. because for [NORP-1] clients we do not have in the system [NORP-1] language.
Agent: So I created
EndUser: For example a segmentation which is all clients with God and Tree of residence in [GPE-2] and [LANGUAGE-1] language and Account enable. They will be translated into the message will be translated into [NORP-1].
Agent: Yes, yes. This is
EndUser: Something that I had to create with a workaround and automation, etc. And this is what we are using for push notifications and SMS.
Agent: The right and this Code itself then that was created with liquid right in terms of aha.
Agent: So therefore it's got all of the variations that then when you plug it into customer.io you simply change that and it's going to bring up as you say your disclaimer is based on license type region location and so on.
Agent: I understand exactly what you're saying. So the basis of the [LAW-1] or the language is liquid, I guess. And then that's how you use it. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
EndUser: Yeah. And even example, we are changing our risk disclaimer.
Agent: A lot more, for
EndUser: Our risk disclaimer for [LOC-1] is, at the moment, [PERCENT-1] of retail clients lose money with this provider. So [PERCENT-2] is usually changed in [DATE-1]. [DATE-2] we are changing the numbers.
EndUser: So we are using one snippet. This is one snippet. And this snippet So if I update the snippet, which is 119, imagine that it's 65 [DATE-3].
Agent: Contains the number.
EndUser: Yes. It's automatically updated in all the communications, in all the resist claimers, in all the footers of the emails.
Agent: And this is a functionality I was talking to you the numbers then?
EndUser: Before. Yes.
EndUser: Wait, wait, do you update on the Google Sheet as well?
Agent: Do you update that
EndUser: And then that feeds into... No, no, the snippets are here. Okay. So Content from the third party provider, the one that we are going to change at the moment we're working without a chart list.
Agent: This is where we are receiving
EndUser: So this is the value and this So we copy and paste this liquid Code and all the [PRODUCT-1] in here under value.
Agent: Is the liquid code.
Agent: Html that appears
EndUser: It's shown in the in the communication in any channel. So let me show you this is the risk. Let's see. I think.
EndUser: Imagine not nobody. Yes, this one. So this is this snippet. Yes, I understand. Well, you see this is [DATE-4]. And so you can hear it doesn't need to change the percentage.
Agent: And that's it. And we include this piece of Code anywhere, and it's automatically changed. Yeah, makes sense. That's good. Yeah, that's very understandable.
EndUser: So I think that's, the kind of thing that you would videos, right, in terms of this is That's it.
Agent: And I guess this is be able to show us in those the process. Yeah.
EndUser: So we can do this, for example, with name of sender emails,
Agent: Urls.
EndUser: Absolutely with everything so we can use liquid everywhere. And this is how it is set up. So if we are migrating it's going to be hard.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, you've got a lot of stuff in it and that has to be taken into account.
Agent: I can see I'm saying what's, you know, things like commercials and so on aside, what would have been the ideal timeframe for you guys
EndUser: To get in a position where you've got the new system set up, whatever that is?
Agent: I don't know exactly.
EndUser: I was talking to [PERSON-1] doing migration plus learning curve.
Agent: Saying,
Agent: To me,
EndUser: Discussing with me as well, it can be [DATE-5] or seven It's a lot of content, it's two different licenses, we are on the verge of getting It's going to be challenging and at the moment we are three in this area.
Agent: Probably.
Agent: A new one.
EndUser: We to be six, so you can imagine
Agent: Need we need to recruit people. So I guess it will be [DATE-6]. Yeah, alongside, as you say, any kind of implementation, migration, and so on. That's good. Yeah, I think that's fairly sensible and realistic.
Agent: If you said to me, we're hoping to get this done set up in [DATE-7], I would have perhaps panicked a little bit, but I think that's understandable.
Agent: And the other question I had is, I guess, slightly, so we have definitely focused on the technical capabilities.
Agent: I think we need to definitely look at those videos and show you that we can do those and how the path to getting there. The other side is the commercial perspective.
Agent: What's the overall perception of how the team view the cost potentially of Marketing cloud?
Agent: Is it something that's seen as actually, this is going to be a lot more expensive than what we're doing now, or we don't really have much of an idea?
Agent: Because I'm conscious we've not scared costs yet, and we're taking the volumes you've sent us already. So I'm working on that with a. pricing team to
EndUser: Come back with some ballpark .
EndUser: But at the moment, is that a concern in terms of budgets within the team, etc?
EndUser: No, not really. To be honest, [ORG-2] is something completely different to what we have at the moment. Functionality is integrations. [ORG-3] was saying, we need to compare some desk, but it's not comparable.
EndUser: He has no Integration with a [PRODUCT-2] or even with attributes within the client space. So, I mean, we can compare. We are scaling, we are growing, and we are looking for something more robust. And that's it.
EndUser: So, if we are looking for something like this, we need to take into account that there are no chatbots at the moment. There are no Integration with customer support .
Agent: Sales
EndUser: Will have a lot more features than what they have at the moment. They rated [ORG-2] them.
Agent: As the best tool for the [PRODUCT-2]
EndUser: And obviously is basically for them because we have other options to get all the information.
EndUser: So we cannot compare it to decision and we'll let's see the final pricing.
Agent: We've taken
EndUser: Let's consider this option for Marketing with all the risks.
Agent: So at the moment we are doing
EndUser: This risk assessment together with [PERSON-2] and with [PERSON-3]. And [DATE-8] a chat to solve all the issues regarding the videos that I'm going to send.
Agent: We can have
Agent: Another person

Speaker 2: We don't use [ORG-3] as a business moment, so that it's all managed from an internally RP solution, that side.
Agent: At the
Speaker 2: Okay, fair enough.
Agent: So yeah, in terms of that solution, that's just an internal solution then, it's not a, it wouldn't be kind of another company similar [ORG-3].
Speaker 2: It's a company called in for based in the states. And it's a dedicated ERP solution that we've only just gone into term on.
Agent: So, okay, fair enough yet. Yeah, no problem. Cool. Let me see what that's here. So in terms of kind of. That's the collaboration between the 242 users.
Agent: Is that used every day or is it used all day every day or is it kind of just a thing?
Speaker 2: In terms of teams, it's constant. It's our main communication platform now internally for all the different teams. But it's just how we can then utilize the program to engage with everyone else. So, shop floor.
Speaker 2: So, it... its potential of document management we've spoken about in the past . looking at things around training videos, policies, procedures, somewhere to host that, whether or not [ORG-2] can do that.
Speaker 2: That's the kind of areas that we're looking at going down towards at the moment. It's a very manual process. So they have to print it out and then give it out. So we're trying to reduce print.
Speaker 2: But if they've got a location where they can literally go to and then go, yep, this is it. And then download it or whatever or view it, then that'll be good as well.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, for sure. A few of our plans carry out that kind of, remove the kind of manual processing and the print docs as well.
Speaker 2: In. And you can download
Agent: Excuse me, in terms of your kind of Security requirements, do you have any kind of Security requirements there or do you use [ORG-4]?
Speaker 2: So most of our internal is all on [ORG-4].
Speaker 2: That's where I was sort of coming down to the management side of things because I would guess that the free version, you wouldn't get the [ORG-4] integration, which is a bit of I would expect, which means then it's more of a manual upload for us all the time to keep on top of the users, whereas all of our users are in [GPE-1].
Speaker 2: So it wouldn't be a lot easier if we could have that sync direct across from our point of view, but we need to look at the costs on both aspects and whether or not there's major limitations on the free version.

Agent: Business Plus plan is $[MONEY-1] per user per month. Then the Enterprise grid is at a kind of, it's kind of built based on the customer's needs.

007637_167_6qr3y000000g4sYAAQ,"EndUser: For the debrief afterwards as well.
Agent: Perfect. That sounds perfect. All right. I just started the Recording now, and then I can start sharing my screen. I just created a brief slide deck that we can walk through that.
Agent: I thought would make it easier just breaking in town where you're at with your current contract [DATE-1] and what it would potentially look like moving forward. Okay.
Agent: So in terms of an agenda, I can just quickly run through what it is that we had previously discussed about just as like a recap.
Agent: So as you know, we're elevating the business plus [DATE-2] plan for you guys to move from that [DATE-3] self-serve model that you're on [DATE-1], which means that you're currently paying $[MONEY-1] per user per year and you're paying almost as you go.
Agent: So as soon as you add an additional user throughout the duration of your contract, you get billed for that additional end user.
Agent: Whereas if we put you on a business plus [DATE-2] plan, we'd be able then to offer you a pricing of $[MONEY-2] per use r per year in addition to locking you in at what we call a [PERSON-1] or a good faith estimate .
Agent: I think when we had spoke the last time, you guys were about 59 active users . at 70 [DATE-1] . that's incredible . awesome . I think that we had locked in a GFE of 89 end users .
Agent: That will be reflected on the proposal that I share shortly .
Agent: Then the second part that I did want to recap is the interest in elevating and being able to help the sales team and sellers save [PERSON-2] So they're not continuously doing admin work in [ORG-1].
Agent: It's just going to be brought to where they're living out of [DATE-1], which as we know in this case is [ORG-2].
Agent: And being able to access those reports and opportunities as well as circulate information that's happening or potentially not happening within [ORG-1] [PERSON-3]: So again, with that being said, where you're at [DATE-1] on your current plan, you are on the [DATE-3] plan paying $[MONEY-1] and you currently have 101 active users.
Agent: So your [DATE-2] investment at this point [DATE-1] is [MONEY-3].
Agent: Again, as I had mentioned, we'd lock you in on that [PERSON-1] for 89, meaning once you surpass that number throughout the duration of the contract, you're not going to receive any additional bills.
Agent: So it's really great from a procurement and finance standpoint, because these are going to be a fixed cost. It's not going to be that similar to the pay as you go plan that you're on [DATE-1].
Agent: It's going to be flat and predictable for you and your team. That being said, I've generated this proposal to share [DATE-1] and for you to circulate internally as well.
Agent: So again, locking in that [PERSON-1] of 102 end users on the [ORG-3] plan, you'd be going from spending $[MONEY-1] per user per year to 146, which equates to a little less than what you're currently paying for your [DATE-2] investment [DATE-1] of that.
Agent: You'd be more on the 14,000 range. Additionally, I added 20 users for the elevate feature. Full transparency is [DATE-4]. So we do have some pretty great promotion circulating around elevate [DATE-1].
Agent: So I was able to apply [PERCENT-1] discount to the team. So saving me some money there. And then instead of that being 673 would now be $[MONEY-4] per user per year.
Agent: So in total with this [PERCENT-1] you'd be saving [MONEY-5]
EndUser: In terms of that elevate feature. If you were to move forward in [DATE-5] with elevate and the business plus [DATE-2] plan. Great, okay.
EndUser: And is the pricing set for the elevate program at the 14?
Agent: Can we potentially look at, you know, five or 10 or just kind of looking for a little bit more of the details around kind of the discount and what we're looking at?
Agent: Absolutely. If you wanted to start off with a lower amount, I can certainly go back to leadership to see if we'd be able to still offer [PERCENT-2].
Agent: It might decrease a little bit just because that account is decreasing as well.
EndUser: But I can definitely see if we could. kind of honor this [PERCENT-1]
Agent: For like 5 to 10 users instead of the 8 if you were able to move forward in [DATE-6]. Okay, great. Awesome. Thank you.
Agent: And do you think that's something that would be plausible to move forward by [DATE-7]?
EndUser: I'm not sure how long the team needs to internally discuss this and kind of go through that legal and financial review, but here's to know your thoughts there. Yeah.
EndUser: So in full transparency, I don't know if right now we have kind of the, capacity to roll out, elevate, um, we're just kind of kind of refocusing and shifting a few things here.
EndUser: So to ask whether it's myself or somebody else to take away to kind of set that up.
EndUser: I'm nervous that bandwidth in [DATE-8] to kind of roll it out, which is the only hesitancy I have of us being able to commit in this timeframe.
Agent: We wouldn't really have the Um, so.
EndUser: I know it's definitely something that would be beneficial to the sales team. However, they're kind of like things are moving around a little bit and we're kind of looking at account management a different. So
EndUser: I definitely think it would be useful and something that I want to talk to my [FAC-1] after this call.
EndUser: I just especially with 12 and not knowing that we'll be able to get it up and running quickly to then have us commit to then start paying. That's really my big concern.
Agent: Gotcha. Yeah. And I know rolling it out could be kind of stressful, especially if somebody on the team has to take over that role.
Agent: I would also, if it would be helpful for your team, be happy to go back to our [PERSON-4] is actually on leave right now. He's he's in the [ORG-4] training, which is incredible.
Agent: But somebody else we can get assigned to potentially walk you through elevating how like the best practices are with setting it up and kind of train certain individuals that might be, you know, responsible or interested in taking on that role to also distribute it amongst the team.
Agent: I'm not sure if that would be helpful or kind of ease into .
Agent: Incorporating or implementing elevate into the team's workspace?
EndUser: Yeah, that's definitely helpful to know. I would most likely ask to lean on some technical expert at [ORG-2] should we move forward with that.
Agent: Perfect. Yeah, wonderful. So I guess as for now, in terms of next steps, you guys are going to take this information. I'm of course going to share this Recording and I can also share this slide deck too.
Agent: So you can physically have that and speak internally in regards to this. Is there a specific time that you'd be willing to give me an answer by like you think that we could potentially have a definite answer
EndUser: By [DATE-9]?
EndUser: Yes, I'll you.
Agent: Work to get that for Okay.
EndUser: Definitely. commit to trying
Agent: To get you an answer by [DATE-9]. Perfect. Because again, yeah, I'm going to try and lock in [PERCENT-2], even if you do lower that head count for [ORG-5].
Agent: But again, I know that it's ending after [DATE-5]. So if this is something the team would be willing to be able to move forward with, definitely would
EndUser: Want to lock you in at that pricing. OK, we'll do. Yeah, I'll do my best to get your response by [DATE-9] so we can get everything aligned and
Agent: Signed as you need. Perfect. Wonderful. Well, thank you so much.
EndUser: I really appreciate the time. Of course, thanks [PERSON-5]. I'll get back to you soon.

Agent: And the reason why I'm reaching out, [ORG-4] is that we were looking to get some conversations with other individuals within [ORG-5]. to better understand the needs of the agency and in particular office that may be siloed.
Agent: So prior to having a conversation with [PERSON-6] who understands calls the shots alongside [PERSON-7], we were looking to get some conversations and introductions with other individuals who leave the other offices within [ORG-6].

006092_167_6qr3y000000g3BNAAY,"EndUser: Okay,
Agent: So it's Recording now. So just to recap, I think the conversation thus far. So as of right now, it sounds like the way to submit it numbers are requests for numbers for [GPE-1], [GPE-2], [GPE-3], [GPE-4], and the [GPE-5].
Agent: The [GPE-4] and the [GPE-5] numbers were not approved by the third party aggregators.
Agent: And so what our team is working on right now, is escalating to the powers that be at those third parties to see if we can make an exception to get an approval for the long codes for the [GPE-5] and [GPE-4].
Agent: And I think one of the challenges right now that we've discussed is these third party aggregators carriers like they're treatment of different use cases that come in and approvals have been a lot more strict in [DATE-1] than previously.
Agent: It just seems like it's a trend or something that's happening just generally as far as SMS usage goes in the [ORG-1] space. And so we're basically again, it's still the point where we are working to escalate.
Agent: To see if we can get this registration approved for [GPE-4] and [GPE-5], given that the nature of the use cases inbound customer experience, not necessarily as sales or Marketing type use case.
Agent: But is that a good summary to lock or anything I'm missing?
EndUser: So I just one thing to add. So the numbers that will not approved are [NORP-1] numbers. So one which we will be using for our sandbox, full copy sandbox, and another one for production.
EndUser: And the number which one more number which was toll free number, which was got denied. So I think [GPE-5] number was approved. It's just [NORP-1] and toll free numbers.
Agent: And I'm going to appreciate [PERSON-1]: A lot of our dev and testing my team, like, you know, some of the like a [ORG-2] team is based out of [GPE-4], right?
EndUser: Like our testing makes sense to have like a [NORP-1] sandbox number and then in prod. So it's like kind of like, you know, directly blocking our dev works for implementing this link.
EndUser: And just adding that extra context for you.
Agent: No, I appreciate that context.
Agent: Well, yeah, so and I think actually, similar to one of the questions you had is was.
Agent: You know, is there any risk of anything happening to the numbers after they've been approved?
Agent: And I think technically at [DATE-2], we. We don't have the power to say no.
Agent: So it's again, I think it's something that's a third party kind of aggregate or carrier decision with those sorts of things.
Agent: So for example, just what I've seen, maybe if there is a customer, not saying a way but maybe for example there's a customer that gets the SMS user to prove and let's say they were using SMS in a way that wasn't in line with the policies of those third parties, then maybe that's something that could get rejected.
Agent: So I can't speak on behalf of just like [ORG-2] approving or denying those sorts of things, but it's just something to keep in mind.
Agent: Again, I think it's a bit tricky because of the... the relationship and kind of multi stakeholder situation here with SMS usage.
Agent: And so, again, we're working to see basically now, I guess, [PERSON-2], just to clarify, we're looking to see for the [GPE-4] for the toll free number, if we can get approval for those two specifically, is the challenge
EndUser: Right now. Yeah, yeah.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Well, this is really helpful. I think I have kind of the more specific data then to bring to the team.
Agent: So unless anyone else has any questions or feedback, I think for me, I'm going to go back to the folks internally and just let them know that we need to focus on getting the candidate and the toll free number, you know, getting a second opinion and seeing if they can make any exceptions for those two.
EndUser: So asking you a difficult question here and putting you on a spot here, [PERSON-3], I know like you can't comment on any timelines because like, you know, these are fluid discussions and you're trying to position it as best as you can, the argument.
EndUser: But can you give us like, you know, at least an [ORG-3] or like, you know, when we can hear the next update from you, like whether like, you know, it's like, you were able to influence or not, whether it's going the right direction or not, because like, otherwise it's going to be like,
Agent: Pretty much an open thing from our side, right?
Agent: So any time that you can share for that, it's updated. Yeah, I'm going to reach out to my folks [DATE-3], right after this meeting. And I'm hoping that by [DATE-4] or [DATE-5], we'll have more feedback from those folks.
Agent: I can't guarantee that, but that's what I'm working towards. So I can commit to pushing our team [TIME-1].
Agent: And hopes that we'll have some additional feedback or I'll have an update for you by [DATE-4] or [DATE-6]. This is a this is a top party item for me.
Agent: I mean, since we first started up, so I'm going to make sure that we, you know, get all the right eyes on to it and.
EndUser: As soon as I hear back, I'll let you know. Thanks, [PERSON-3], [PERSON-4], [GPE-6],
EndUser: [PERSON-5], anything else from you guys?
EndUser: Thanks [PERSON-3] for providing all the information.
EndUser: Yeah, so nothing from my end.
EndUser: Yeah, I guess for now we just have to wait, right?
EndUser: So no further questions for now. So yeah, next click will wait for your update.
EndUser: You said [DATE-4], right?
EndUser: Click now. Click this cross. Hopefully we get this sorted because they got. Yeah, we've already started the dev work, and we really, really hope that there's not going to be a blocker. But you've always delivered for us.

Agent: Yeah, we have an Enterprise CRM agreement with the whole [ORG-5], but within the, so the [GPE-1], [ORG-6], we did a contact center.
EndUser: Uh-huh. How
Agent: So, essentially we're helping streamline. They had a bunch of records that people were calling in about, and they just had no way of like streamlining all the interactions and stuff.

EndUser: You keep like [ORG-9].
Agent: What's it is?
Agent: And is it like?
EndUser: Uh Well, on our end, excuse me, I'm getting all this coal here. I have a lot of the cost. We are awaiting to see what happens with [ORG-3] for a budget request that we put in.
Agent: Huh. Yeah.

EndUser: I mean, our full mission and vision is for blind and low vision and print disabled, which means a person that physically can't hold a book or turn a page, qualify for the service.
Agent: Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.

EndUser: In doing that for us of the future, we are looking at reinventing a portion of what used to be called reference, now the term is information services, where we might have additional people take a lot of inbound.
EndUser: We already know it is not going to be to our best advantage to try to use [ORG-10] or fully automate and our system is really built.
EndUser: On the human experience because you are dealing with blind people, you have to talk to a person.

Agent: So I was curious if you went with an alternate solution. Or if it would make sense for us to connect here again, we're in [DATE-2] right now.
Agent: So we're offering pretty generous pricing options through [DATE-3].
EndUser: Yeah, I don't really think that we're a good fit to use [ORG-1]. We
EndUser: Didn't really have a project that we were evaluating. I think I talked to, I forget his name, but yeah, he sent me a couple webinars.
Agent: Was it [PERSON-1]?
EndUser: Yeah, it might have been. But yeah, I don't think that we really have a use case to use your kind of technology.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, I completely understand that. And so my team here, I don't know if you remember from that far back, but we work specifically with small and then high growth organizations within retail and consumer good.
Agent: But sales first primarily were known to be like an Enterprise level software.
EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: But actually within [DATE-4] we've been expanding a ton in the small business space. And we're working with organizations just like you that are a little bit on a smaller side.
Agent: And we become a lot more compatible with meeting your guys' sorts of needs. So if you would have [TIME-1] or [DATE-5] we could just Put like a quick sync on the calendar.
Agent: Go through our offerings. Go through your priorities for, um, for the business in [DATE-6]. and see if we could align and support in any way. If that would make sense.

Agent: And like, I don't want to just sort of send over more like, standardized generic resources or like send you over too many things to the point where it's kind of like overwhelming to look at.
Agent: So that's why we typically suggest [TIME-2] meeting because it's [TIME-3] out of your day. And that way we can tailor it specifically to [PERSON-2]'s needs.
Agent: And then sort of outline like the competitors that we're working with that are similar sizes. And then you can sort of tell us what you want from there.
Agent: And then that way my account director should be able to get more tailored resources over to you following community. Okay.

Agent: Okay.
Agent: So you guys haven't moved forward with any sort of [PRODUCT-1] since our last conversation.

EndUser: A lot of our work that needs to be done is kind of internal and operational.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So that's kind of what I'm mostly interested in. And if you guys have any of the capabilities to help out, I would be interested in looking at some of that material.

Agent: Yeah. So that's definitely something that we hear from people a lot is that, so like these sorts of companies are more like starting up on other operations working on internal projects and things like that.
Agent: And then like you, like one struggle that we hear from a lot of our customers is that they'll say later along the line they wish they would have implemented <inaudible> scores.
Agent: As their process from the beginning, because we can help you keep track of all of those projects. We can integrate all of your different technologies where you're keeping track of these things together.
Agent: And then that way it'll help you be more efficient. Nothing slips through the cracks. Everything is visible on your end, not only internally, but a view of the customer as well.

Agent: Okay.

EndUser: There's a million events, but a lot of those events, they just won't make a profit for that business model, right?

EndUser: Direct marketing.
EndUser: So it's a different sales process for fine designs, right?

Agent: So
EndUser: Especially the ones that we want and our Competition has.
Agent: That lines up pretty closely with exactly what [PERSON-2] had shared with me.
EndUser: So it's...

Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: You send them a little gift, you follow up with an email, you can give them a call. It's a longer sales process than usual.

Agent: Oh,
EndUser: Person, right?

006198_167_6qr3y000000sZptAAE,"Agent: All right, can both of you see my screen here?
EndUser: Yes. OK,
Agent: Cool. So just mention the agenda, pricing, partner introduction, next steps. So when we think of pricing at [ORG-1], we have three levers we can pull.
Agent: It is the length of the contract, the amount of seats, as well as the optimal discounting, dependent on when you're able to make a decision.
Agent: In my experience, companies of your size with the evaluation that you're running contracts or anywhere from one [DATE-1] in length. I recommend when your Contract start.
Agent: I don't want to have locked into something when you're just starting to implement something like this. So any thoughts there. No, So this is the proposal I got back from our deal desk.
EndUser: That's fine. Okay, cool.
Agent: We have on the left here the two types of licenses, Service Cloud and customer community.
Agent: 10 for the Service Cloud is a list pricing of $[MONEY-1] per month per license, which comes out to an annual Price of [MONEY-2] with [PERCENT-1] discount approved, which brings that [DATE-2] amount to [MONEY-3].
Agent: The customer community, this is where the partners in [GPE-1] come into play. So when I spoke with [PERSON-1] [DATE-3], we mentioned two licenses, so two logins for the team over there.
Agent: We can log in, make edits to the orders, upload files, but of course only viewing the important information that they need and what you want them to see.
Agent: And that comes out to [DATE-4] for a total of $[MONEY-4].
Agent: Cool. So I know you were trying to get a sense of your budget when we started this.
Agent: Where does that fall in your expectations?
EndUser: You are the first Price I've gotten. So it falls a little higher than I expected, but not outrageous.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: What other providers are you evaluating?
EndUser: No one yet who you'll be evaluating time.
EndUser: Nobody yet. OK. Sounds
Agent: Good. Yeah, I mean, to speak on it being more than you expected, I mean, [ORG-1] is the most expensive product on the market. I won't lie to you there. But we're also the number one rated.
Agent: And we have a lot of different functionality for every type of business. I like to think of this as a phase one of a relationship with [ORG-1].
Agent: Obviously, we can touch a lot of parts like the [PRODUCT-1], if that's on the road, even like replacing the phone company, but the value there is consolidating everything in one place. Sure.
EndUser: So
Agent: If there's no pushback there, definitely want to move forward with bringing in a partner and kind of walking you through those steps.
EndUser: Well, first off, I'd like to be defined what this annual list [ORG-2] of whatever $[MONEY-5].
EndUser: What does that include?
Agent: I have no idea what Okay.
EndUser: We're getting for this.
Agent: So, remember when [PERSON-2] ran the demo [DATE-3] or [DATE-5]?
EndUser: Yeah. So, that
Agent: Includes everything we covered. So, the ticketing system, being able to manage orders and make edits.
Agent: And just having everything in one place and consolidating the information and being able to access it, not only for the [GPE-2]-based team, but allowing those partners in [GPE-1] to view that information and make edits, upload pictures, be notified when something goes wrong and they need to make an update.
Agent: And for both of you being managers and overseeing the whole operation, this also allows you to run forecasts and dashboards and just see the whole operation.
Agent: Yep. So based on the evaluation that we've had so far over [DATE-6] and what you need and what you want, these are the two licenses that we spun up and quoted before.
Agent: And this will all be in writing, we'll send over to both of you after the call so you can see it.
EndUser: Perfect. That's, that's I want to see the breakdown breakout of what we're getting because this doesn't tell me much at Okay.
Agent: All. Yeah, yeah. No, I know. Yeah. Cool. So. This is where we are so far since we've met over [DATE-7]. We've gone through three calls so far, which is, which is always great to see.
Agent: [PERSON-1], I know you're leading this implementation. So I'll ask you, what is your availability, let's say [DATE-8] to meet with a partner.
Agent: It'll kind of touch more on the discovery aspect of real specific needs that you'll need help with and getting it set up. like customizing the objects for the service orders.
Agent: What information the partners can and cannot see, just making all that super clear. So I would love to hear kind of your availability over [DATE-9].
EndUser: Looks like I'm open.
Agent: Perfect. I'll have to ping him the partner and see what he's for me, but once I have a time, I'll just give you a call. We can get it on the books. And this is a question for you.
Agent: Once you're comfortable with seeing everything that we offer, the pricing checks out for [ORG-1] plus the partner, when would you be able to make a decision and get something like get this going with [PERSON-1]?
EndUser: Any time.
Agent: Okay, amazing. And typically Implementation takes anywhere from four [DATE-10]. We've seen people do it slower, faster. That's about the average. And the partner can talk more to that.
Agent: I know we scheduled [TIME-1], so if there's nothing else to really cover, I don't want to take too much more of your time.
Agent: Like I said, I will have all of this in writing sent over to both of you so you can see the actual Contract and view all the terms.
Agent: Anything else you guys want to cover before we hop off?
EndUser: I'm good.
Agent: No, I think the Yeah, of course.
EndUser: Breakdown of it all is the biggest thing.
Agent: You'll see it line item and you can see. But we covered, and I can send some one-pagers of the products, so you can see like a walkthrough.
EndUser: Oh yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: But safe, it's confident is that everything we've covered throughout the evaluation, everything you need it is included in those two licenses. Okay.

EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: But she also said that. Thanks for watching. Yeah, just chat with you and y'all will have your conversation and then we'll kind of circle up [DATE-3]. Okay.
EndUser: All right. All right.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: You know what, [PERSON-1], I knew this. That's exactly how that was going to play out. This is why I asked you to call me that.
Agent: No, I am three for.
EndUser: All right.
EndUser: So if you have [TIME-2], why don't we just figure this out right now?
EndUser: Okay. The.
Agent: I have more than [TIME-2], so I'm good forever long, you Okay.
EndUser: So when it comes to user counts here, okay, these are the people who will actually be working inside of [ORG-1], correct?
Agent: Are.
Agent: Basically anybody who requires a login.
EndUser: Anybody who requires a, but, yeah, right now in my world, everybody who works in our CINA platform requires a log in, right?
EndUser: And so Is it a one-to-one relationship where everybody who has an [ORG-2] login will require a [ORG-1] login?
Agent: Yes.
Agent: Not necessarily. Like if just because those folks who are working within [ORG-2], like, well, I guess it depends.
Agent: Are they, are they operating out of sales force?
Agent: Um. like as an interface or they're just using data that was from [ORG-1] that's now in [ORG-2], but they work out of [ORG-2].

Agent: Okay.
Agent: But the goal is for them to begin to work out of sales force with what y'all are doing because of the changes in updates that they all put in the play, correct?

EndUser: It sounds like that [ORG-1] is actually, I can't tell if it's actually completely replacing the [ORG-3] or not.
Agent: So traditionally when you are using [ORG-1] and [ORG-2], or really any [PRODUCT-1] system, [ORG-1] is becoming more widely used with end healthcare because it's easier for the user to just have all the information they need in front of them and operate within that system.
Agent: So yeah, your schedulers will primarily, from what I understand, I wasn't a part of the initial y'all had a different rep [PERSON-2] who is part of initially putting this deal out in front, so I'm not as familiar with your internal use case.
Agent: However, from what I've heard, most of your folks are going to be operating out of [ORG-1] to then, you know, have that information transfer in and out of [ORG-2] is necessary, but the primary use is going to be [ORG-1] and I can talk to [PERSON-3] also [TIME-1].
EndUser: Thanks for watching.
Agent: And just get some more clarity there on who all, you know, they were, or you all collectively are creating a sport.
Agent: But yeah, my assumption was that your scheduler's clinicians, whoever's working within [ORG-1] would have historically worked out of [ORG-2], and this would be an improvement.
EndUser: Including that includes our revenue cycle people, everybody, right?

007150_167_6qr3y000000ocKLAAY,"Agent: Hello, [PERSON-1].
Agent: Hi, can you hear me?
Agent: Yes, it's all good. I can.
Agent: How are you?
Agent: I'm wonderful.
Agent: How about yourself?
Agent: Good. I have a little bit of a cold. I might sound a little stuffy, but that's the worst. Could be the flu.
EndUser: Oh, it is the flu. Yes, I could be so happy. It's just a little bit of a stuffy nose. We'll take it. Yeah. Well, hopefully that'll make you all good for [DATE-1].
EndUser: Because it's early in [DATE-2] that you have to get out of my system. Yeah. Exactly. So I know we had scheduled this to touch face about using [ORG-1] and I'm going to be honest with you.
EndUser: I went in the route of using [ORG-2]. And it's working very, very well. I do have a substantial amount of individuals on the platform. And I think it's [MONEY-1].
EndUser: I think I pay for some additional things that I need. And because I'm dealing with college students right now, they were on [ORG-2] already.
EndUser: But then eventually my concern, because I am going to be bringing in some more professionals.
EndUser: But I still feel if I was to tell the professionals, because it's like mentorship as well, that I have because it's like close to 197 females, that they will join and help me out.
EndUser: So as much as I like Black from a Professional business aspect, it was just more the pricing and the passion. for me for what I'm doing. It just didn't make any sense.
EndUser: I think I'm going to use m y money to invest in LinkedIn talent solutions. I use them already to find prospects, but I' m going to spend, I know I'm going to get yield results, but using that .
EndUser: I don't need [ORG-1], but thank you so much for that with me. Yeah, no,
Agent: It's one of those things where for like your type of use case for those communities, [ORG-2] does have better pricing and we have our free offering, but it doesn't quite have quite the degree of capabilities that you
EndUser: Term as I grow as I get bigger to me It would make sense to have that Professional feel And I can maybe that is a question in terms of transitioning Like if I needed to take everyone off a discor d and come to [ORG-1], you think I should start Because like right now I have telephone number s and email addresses and that would be my way of tryin g to, you know, I would have to send out a mass emai l or something like that But maybe there's thoughts around, you know , I cannot integrate [ORG-1] into [ORG-2] because I could put links into [ORG-2], you know.
EndUser: Oh my gosh, wait, let me pause there for a second.
EndUser: No, you know what?
EndUser: Because my husband and I, he was the one who told me about [ORG-2] because he's like a gaming fanatic and he's like used [ORG-2] and I'm like, that is not what I need. I'm not getting on [ORG-2].
EndUser: But I'm so happy I'm here because I can incorporate links. It can redirect in places. My number one concern that I am having right now.
EndUser: So my group pretty much, I'm helping college students, females, gain access to the tech industry. And then I'm giving them mental.
EndUser: And guidance from people who are in the industry So I reach out to people on [PRODUCT-1] n and they say that they're willing to mento r and then I'll schedule some time and we're all there I really do wanna have a group of working professionals And in my mind, not right now but when I get bigger and larger , I wonder if I can have the working professionals on [ORG-1] and have the college students on [ORG-2].
EndUser: I don't know.
Agent: Because I just searched if there is a discord integration to [ORG-1] and there's not. I don't know if [ORG-1] goes into [ORG-2].
EndUser: No, it doesn't. You put out the app is separate. It's the opposite. I can put a [ORG-1] link on [ORG-2] and it'll just bring them to [ORG-1]. Yeah, and I can invite link as well.
EndUser: I'm a thing about, I'm a thing about. [ORG-1] has a URL. So you could just like bookmark that in the discord. I don't know what, I've never used discord. I don't know what it looks like.
EndUser: Neither have I, but I will tell you now that I'm using it. I'm like, you can do a lot of different things on discord. And it's not here. No, you can do a lot.
EndUser: But I'm going to see and ponder on that. Like I'll keep your contact information. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, we don't need to schedule something. But I am going to think about that.
EndUser: I'm going to talk to my husband [TIME-1] and really kind of. I still at [DATE-3], I still will be bringing them to discord to bring them to [ORG-1] now.
EndUser: Would that make sense?
Agent: Yeah, I don't know. At that point, then you have a lot of
EndUser: Different things you're managing. But the problem that I'm having right now when I try to get the working profession news and I'll tell them, hey, I got these group of females. They really want to talk to you.
EndUser: I'm getting the response. Oh, I really don't use discord. Don't know what discord is about. So that is a challenge, but I guarantee you if I tell them about [ORG-1], they will be very... Yeah.
EndUser: So is it that I'm also maybe making the girls go to Slack?
Agent: It could be like a generational thing too, because I think even some older people probably don't even... I've never been to [ORG-1] before. And then I feel like [ORG-2]'s even like below [ORG-1] in terms of age group knowledge.
Agent: Exactly. Well, these group of females that I am interacting with on average, they're like 14 to like 23. So some of them, it's in a tech world. So gaming too is something that they do.
Agent: So [ORG-2] is like, it's, I think the most of the people that I have on my platform, they've already had [ORG-2]. So
EndUser: Yeah, and but I will tell you, I am getting responses from the working professionals. not so excited about joining [ORG-2] in order to connect with some of the students.
EndUser: So I've been doing just like, because it has an unprofessional feel to it. And that's the stigma. Yeah. No, and that's how it was for me too.
EndUser: But I mean, I used it [DATE-4] and my interactions are strong and I can just do video chat calling. I can do so much with them. Yeah, I'm going to really think about this, so.
Agent: Yeah, we got information like, okay, reach out to me for anything. Um, thank you. Yeah.
EndUser: I love supporting women in the Professional world. So like. Although I might not be making a sale for me, which is my job. I'm happy to like, I'm happy to support you on this one and talk. Yeah.
EndUser: And I promise you, if you will be the first person that I'm going to think about related to [ORG-1].
EndUser: And if I can push in any shape of form to support your cause in terms of sales, because I work on commission based too, I'm going to be honest, I completely get it.
EndUser: So even though I'm a recruiter for a company, I do get a commission off of each person that I do hire. So I want you to know, let's keep each other in contact. Like, yeah, no problem.
EndUser: I will definitely do that. Yes. All right I don't know if any questions pop up We'll do it anyway. All right Have a good one. Take you to holidays.

Agent: Yeah, one time to speak, what can I do for you?
EndUser: Yes, I am. I was placed a request because we wanted a quote so that way we could renew a deployment for a tableau.
Agent: Sure thing. Before I think we had been talking about [ORG-1], is this still [ORG-2] retirement.
EndUser: Yes. Oh, no, not health and human services. This is [GPE-1] [ORG-3] in [GPE-2], [GPE-3].
Agent: Sorry, that's what I meant. I couldn't remember the exact title, but yes. Yeah. And then.
Agent: Was it [PERSON-1]?
Agent: Was that I can blank it on your associate's name?
EndUser: Oh, yes, [PERSON-2].
Agent: [PERSON-2], that's it. Yep. Okay. And yes.
Agent: So what do you guys need exactly?
Agent: You need a updated quote.
EndUser: Yeah, we need an updated quote.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: And is that the same?
Agent: It's the same product that we had quoted before. I can't remember. We sent you a quote before. I'm blanking. My memory doesn't go back and forth.
EndUser: I remember we had scheduled a meeting in order to consult so we could discuss exactly what we needed. And I believe the meeting did occur. I didn't attend, but then I never heard anything back about it.
Agent: Yes. Okay, yeah, we had met with [PERSON-2]. I count my coworker and sent her something, but we can. Definitely reengage and get back into that. What's the best next step do you think that we should.
Agent: Meet along with my account executive and we have a new. Or so we have the same account executive as before, his name is [PERSON-3].
EndUser: I'm sorry.
EndUser: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
Agent: Yes, sorry what I was saying is.
Agent: What do you think the best next step is, if it's to meet, to go over that again?
Agent: Just so we can, you know.
EndUser: Perhaps yes, another meeting would be a good idea.
Agent: Okay. I could set that up then.
Agent: Is there any day in particular that would work?
Agent: I don't know if you do have a [PERSON-2] schedule in front of you.
EndUser: Let me go ahead and call her really quick. Please stay on the line.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I'm gonna call from a different phone.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, sure thing.
EndUser: Thank you.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Hello?
Agent: Yes.
EndUser: Yes. Okay. So actually, [PERSON-2] is the point of contact for a different department. It's a different division, but kind of in the same general department.
Agent: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
EndUser: But this was actually for the epidemiology division.
EndUser: And we were wondering, do you happen to know who were the people that were attended the last meeting?
Agent: I believe it was [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5] maybe?
EndUser: Oh, okay. Yeah, that would be [ORG-4]. How about we just go ahead and... Mm-hmm.
Agent: But so the reason why we met though, [PERSON-6], I think was in regards to [PERSON-7] certified data analyst exam readiness.
Agent: And that came with some e-learning as well as to [PERSON-7] data analyst exam vouchers, and then as well [PERSON-7] desktop and [PERSON-7] prep software trial. So that's, I believe, where we had left it.
Agent: So, but now they're trying to renew the actual licenses that we're seeing.
EndUser: I believe so, yes.
Agent: Gotcha. Okay, that's great. So who I guess, yeah, go ahead.
EndUser: So as far as an actual date, I'm not sure actually.
Agent: Well, that's fine for now.
Agent: Who would be the point of contact would it still be [PERSON-2] or somebody else?
EndUser: Let's say the point of contact, can I give you two points of contact?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
EndUser: Okay, so the first one would be [PERSON-8], [PERSON-9].
Agent: [PERSON-10].
Agent: [PERSON-8]?
EndUser: Yes. So the her email, let me just get that real quick. Okay, her email is [ORG-5]: And then two. So, F H E R N A N D E two. And then at sign. See, I. Dot. Dot.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Got it.
Agent: Gotcha.
EndUser: And then the other point of contact would be [PERSON-13]. And her email is [PRODUCT-1]Agent: Gotcha.
EndUser: So it's a B as in Bravo. P is in Papa, E is in [LOC-1], R is in [PERSON-9], E is in [LOC-1], Z is in Zulu, and then at [ORG-6].
Agent: Awesome. And then they're with the epidemiology or with a different department.
EndUser: They are with the epidemiology division.
Agent: Cool. Awesome. And I should reach out to them in regards to setting up a date to meet.
Agent: And would you, is that correct?
EndUser: Perfect, yeah, yeah.
Agent: And would you want to be, you want me to see you on those emails as well?
EndUser: Yes, please.
Agent: Okay. And your [PERSON-13] at [PERSON-14].
EndUser: Yeah, yes.
Agent: Cool. And [PERSON-6], remind me of your position.
Agent: Are you within public works?
Agent: Are you within health department?
EndUser: I'm kind of actually within the IT or IST division.
Agent: Gotcha.
Agent: Then can I ask you a quick question just to get my wits about me within [GPE-2]?
EndUser: Ok.
Agent: Where else?
Agent: Are you guys having trouble right now?
Agent: Because I mean, I work for [ORG-7] in [PERSON-7], and we do a lot more than just data visualization.
Agent: And we don't do too much with you guys right now, even though you're one of the larger cities in the state, and it's sort of a weak spot for us.
Agent: So any information you could give me in terms of who I could reach out to that might need a [PRODUCT-2] or data visualization. would be greatly appreciated.
Agent: Is there any big initiative that [PERSON-14] was taking on [DATE-1] that I could, you know, focus in on?
EndUser: If there's anything of the sort, I would not be aware of that sort of information.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: It'd be better if you reached out to them.
Agent: And can I... Okay.
Agent: Well, can I... Can I ask you, do you know anything about, like, the bridge division?
EndUser: Bridge division. I haven't heard of anything, but if you want, I can also, give you a point of contact to our IST division because I mostly handle health, like the health department alone.
Agent: Gotcha. Okay. I apologize. Yeah. Yeah, any contact would be much appreciated.
EndUser: Okay, so the point of contact that I can give you is [PERSON-18]. So, let me give you the email.
EndUser: It would be A as an alpha, C as in [PERSON-9], A as in alpha, S as in [ORG-8], T as in [WORK_OF_ART-1], A as in alpha, and as in [DATE-2], E as in [LOC-1], D as in [LOC-2], A as in alpha, and then add to CI.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: The same domain.
Agent: Perfect. Cool. Awesome. And yeah, well, I appreciate that. I'll give on there to shoot him a note and just pick his brain, see if there's anything else that we can do.
EndUser: Oh.
Agent: But yeah, that makes sense. So you're part of IC, but you're attached basically to the health department and help them out. That makes sense.
EndUser: Correct.
Agent: Cool. Awesome. Well, yeah, I'll send an email right now to [PERSON-8] and [PERSON-17] and I'll see you on there and see you about the time to meet him. Go over what you guys need.
EndUser: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Agent: Well, yeah, thank you, [PERSON-6]. Let me know if there's anything else I can do, but if not, have a great rest of your week.

Speaker 3: This is a dismayed on API call to record the Every state of the page will be Recorded via our API.
Speaker 4: Use of use.
Speaker 3: Okay, and then continue. You type your full name, you type your phone number, your email address, and then continue. There's a problem to make sure that the contact info is correct.
Speaker 3: Confirm, and then we send and verification email, yeah, one time use, then to file it dead. And then the same goes with the phone number. Okay, this is the part where you select your citizenship.
Speaker 3: It's going to be different, the flow if you're not an [NORP-1] or you're an foreigner. Then let's select I'm an [NORP-1]. This is the part where we do the OCR.
Speaker 4: Okay. Take picture.
Speaker 3: And the camera.
Speaker 4: Just
Speaker 3: Okay. This is the guideline that I explained to you before.
Speaker 4: Okay.
Speaker 3: So we make sure the user capture the ID card within the specified frame and press. And then apparently the team haven't edited the [ORG-1] where the pre-processing takes place, but actually in this part.
Speaker 3: They have the pre-processing abilities to crop and then do it in hands to reduce the contrast and everything. And then we use this image.
Speaker 3: Actually, we have our OCR that I built, but currently they can only recognize the [ORG-2] or the ID number and the full name and the date of birth. So I'm still building to recognize the rest of the fields.
Speaker 3: And then we confirm it one by one. Then we continue. This is the part where we do [ORG-3]. OK. This is our [ORG-4] instruction, detecting [PERSON-1], passed, continue.
Speaker 3: So we make API call again, verification to our verification authority. And then the prefiality is actually issue.
Speaker 4: Okay, so the rest
Speaker 3: Is set password and everything. Like the rest of the sign
Speaker 4: Up process right?
Speaker 4: The rest of the sign up process. We can skip this part actually.
Agent: I don't see the people have any more questions on this process.
Agent: No questions on the front end, so I'm more concerned about what that you need to do in terms of the downstream process.
Speaker 3: Happens next
Agent: Actually, you have to go by another team member or you just take care of only this front end part. Sorry. You only take care of this front end part and the subsequent steps that is required
Speaker 3: To pass all this information to a system or to a database.
Agent: Oh, actually,
Speaker 3: When we register,
Speaker 4: We make an API call to the back end. Okay. That verification that you did was a verification API, at this point.
Speaker 3: Right?
Speaker 3: It was a service So basically all Fergification API.
Speaker 4: This data that you have collected earlier, you would pass it on to the verification API.
Speaker 4: And that verification API, what does it trigger?
Speaker 3: At the back end, does it trigger the internal system where the data gets stored first?
Speaker 3: It will be stored on our management system wait. Let me share my screen again. Okay.
Speaker 3: Can you see my screen?
Agent: Yes, speaking.
Speaker 3: Actually, this should be the cut-the-pay image, the ID card. This part, we want to do the [ORG-5]. And then so this fields on the right, [PRODUCT-1], [PERSON-2], [PERSON-3],
Speaker 4: And everything will be filled automatically instead of manually typing like this.
Speaker 3: Oh, okay.
Speaker 3: And this is your internal system, right?
Speaker 3: Yes, this is our internal system. So currently, every human verification
Agent: Squatter, let's say, they type manually one by one for every field. Yeah, so I'm just interested to see how you get into this system. This is a web application, or this is a tick-line application.
Agent: Then how do you get to this page, the process of the UI?
Agent: Because it's important to have a glass of all this, so that the bot... would know exactly how to navigate to this page and put in all this information.
Speaker 3: Oh, so the bot actually just have to make an API call and then the data will be presented.
Agent: That's API available already.
Speaker 3: Yeah, I Okay.
Agent: Hope you have all this information.
Agent: That's good. That's
Speaker 4: Good. Yeah, that's good.
Speaker 4: Then in that case, [PERSON-4], what I understand is what doesn't have to log in into this to fill it right?
Agent: Yeah, running already because you don't need [ORG-6] if there's API available.
Speaker 3: No, no, we just need the [ORG-6] on this. Maybe this part to scan the cut the image in this part.
Agent: And then
Speaker 3: Automatically if you're on this right side instead of manually typing one by one like this currently.
Agent: Okay,
Speaker 4: So if that is the expectation, then [PERSON-4]'s question over here is learnt.
Speaker 4: How do you get into the system so that we can read the [ORG-7], which is there on the left hand side of the screen and fill up the information like [ORG-8], [PERSON-5], all those things.
Agent: Or is this image stored somewhere else for the robot?
Agent: Because that means I don't need to come to this application to look for this image.
Speaker 3: Yeah, you can you can just make an API call to this image and then automatically. Push push it the push to the API to smart.
Agent: Be really technically where is this image taught inside database?
Speaker 3: But
Speaker 3: Our database.
Agent: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 3: You can pick it up.
Speaker 4: Okay. So what you're saying is we'll pick it up from an API and read it.
Speaker 4: But [PERSON-4], where will you store that image to?
Speaker 4: We'll store it on the local domain.
Agent: We can temporarily store it inside a local folder structure, then we can delete it after that. So you have an API call to pick up this image. And put it inside a local file system.
Speaker 3: Yep.
Speaker 4: So for the place where the bot will be running, we will store it in a local file system there.
Agent: But what is
Speaker 4: Going to read that information from that image, going to fill up all this information via the API again.
Agent: And it's
Speaker 4: Okay.
Agent: Okay. All

Agent: I hear you. We just rolled into our new physical year last in [DATE-2].
Agent: We're [DATE-3] behind So things have been a little hectic over here with all the change But I wanted to get in touch with you because I just got aligned over to the account I know there was conversations with you multiple times throughout [DATE-4] I know budget budget was a big concern last time you were kind of just looking for yourself Maybe more for some like dispatching and stuff of that nature Okay We did, and a reason for my reach out is we just rolled out a new license.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, yes, sir.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Agent: It's more of a starter, so there is no Implementation cost.
Agent: And I wanted to just gauge your interest to see if we could schedule maybe just a quick call [DATE-5] to dive into it, to see if it would be a fit for you guys.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: It's possible. I'll tell you what's going on. We've gone through a restructuring, just because we've decreased the size of our fleet. So we're... We're not in a, I mean, I'll be glad to look at it.

Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But just to kind of give you kind of some background of where we're at right now. So.
Agent: No, and I do appreciate that. And I'll just, I guess just let me ask this question.
Agent: When, when you're looking, and are you looking for how many licenses would you guys need?
Agent: Would it just be for yourself or are you looking for it?
EndUser: Hmm.
Agent: You need to be involved?
Agent: Because that can give me an idea, like I said, with budget, I just want to make sure we're only appropriate solution your way.
EndUser: Yeah,
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, probably looking at two, I would think. And that's, you know, for our dispatching and myself.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: So, yeah.
Agent: Okay. So the two options we have, we have a starter license that starts at $[MONEY-1] a month per user, which is very cheap out of the box.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: You're going to get the benefits of [ORG-3] on that. And then we have one that's called [ORG-4] that starts at $[MONEY-2] a month or [MONEY-3].
EndUser: Sure.
Agent: I can double check on it for you per user.
EndUser: Ok, this far.
Agent: But again, this one is a little bit more equipped with sales, service, and Marketing functionality. if you need that.
EndUser: Ok.
Agent: So that's email blast, that service for, you know, potentially on your dispatch side, we could kind of incorporate a little bit. But again, there's no Implementation fees associated with this.
Agent: It's kind of a. a out of the box solution where we drag everything you guys have and drop it into it and get you up and run it.
EndUser: Okay. Yeah.

EndUser: What the <inaudible>?
EndUser: I
EndUser: Don't
EndUser: Hear you. Go. Hmm.
Agent: All right, so yeah, just go into comments, for example.
Agent: Okay, let me go back. Sorry. I have some of this. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Quick details.
Agent: See where it says parent account. That's where you can start building that out.
Agent: Um, so I don't know if do you have an example of a count that is like another [ORG-1] account that would like if this were a child account of, is this or a subsidiary or another [ORG-1] location, then you would have one account that would be the headquarter and then you would put in the new account as a parent account.
Agent: So if a lead came in for [ORG-1] of [GPE-1] or [ORG-1] of [GPE-2], you would put that account in as [ORG-1] and [GPE-2] or whatever you want to call it.
Agent: Then under that parent account tab, you'd be able to go in and type in [ORG-1] as the parent. And then up on the top right hand side, you can click view account hierarchy
EndUser: And it's going to be able to give you a whole.
Agent: Org chart of what, you know, what, what the count is and who the subsidiary is, you know?
Agent: And you, I mean, you could even do it so much as to like, if you imagine us as [ORG-2], right?
Agent: [ORG-2] is the parent. And then we have under us, we have like Marketing cloud, and then [PRODUCT-1] has like different products. And those could all be considered different companies and brands.
Agent: And like you could build that kind of relationship tree just based on filling out that field. So that's what I would recommend as best practices for you guys.
EndUser: All right.
EndUser: So does that make sense?
EndUser: No, it totally does. I don't think the parent account options really ever explained. So the only way to turn a lead into a contact is if the contact has an associated account.
Agent: Absolutely. Yeah, you have to have an account associated with it. Yeah, [PERSON-2], every contact has to have an account.
EndUser: [PERSON-2] that. So we could just essentially do one, like just a generic account. And then everybody has to put that as the parent and then go from there. Exactly. Yeah. All right.
EndUser: If they're creating, if they're, if they don't want, like, if it's the same role, like, if it's, I don't know what your leads are, but like, if you're dealing with the purchasing agent at [ORG-3] and then [ORG-4] energy of, you know, you can have one parent organization called [ORG-4], whatever, you know, I mean, you can build on top of that too.
EndUser: Like, you could have like
Agent: [ORG-5], then you could have the parent account of [ORG-5] is [ORG-4]. You know, so like, you can do so many different levels by just using it. that parent account. Okay
EndUser: Build. So yeah . Got it. All right. Well, now that I know really about that a little bit more, I can I can mess around with it and present it to [PERSON-3]. All right, man. No, that's okay.
EndUser: No, that's okay. No, that's all right. Hey, why we're on the call. I wasn't going to let you know about this until I got things formally transitioned. You guys have been reassigned to someone else on my team.

Agent: Otherwise, I would have kind of done that transition [DATE-1]. I just want to give her the download on that count. I know you guys had a really rough experience of implementation, so. Um, you know, I, um, yeah.

Agent: Well, thanks.
Agent: Are you splitting or are you transitioning roles?
Agent: Like what's your gig?
Agent: Oh, no. Yeah. No, we just shuffle things up. Essentially, people moving out of the team. And then what happens is I end up getting too much business.
Agent: And then they have to trim some of mine away and give it to other people that maybe lose. So just that kind of thing. But no, yeah. Stained with [ORG-2]. Love it. Cool.
Agent: But I'm happy to help, you know, however I can. So feel free to continue to reach out.

005789_167_0LQ3y000009GUR0GAO,"Agent: Here on kind of a listening tour just kind of learned how things are kind of going for our users and just kind of curious to understand how [PERSON-1] is being leveraged over to adaptive biotechnologists.
Agent: I saw your user so I thought I'd give you a call just to see if it's a good platform.
EndUser: Yeah, it's going good. I'm a huge [PERSON-1] fan. I work in HR, so [PERSON-1] has been really great in terms of being able to connect multiple data sources for me in HR.
EndUser: Typically, you have like a dozen different applications that you're using, learning, recruiting, benefits, payroll, time and attendance.
EndUser: It just goes on and on, right?
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And so each one of those has its own architecture and typically the companies I've worked in, all the key stakeholders for each application cannot, align on like a single huge [ORG-1] like [ORG-2] or [ORG-3] that does that has all the modules so inevitably they want to go out and buy their own application that's that has their bells and whistles so for me then that means I got to figure out how to bring that all together and put it in one visual space and a link called that data somehow.
EndUser: And so [PERSON-1] has just been phenomenal for that. So yeah, the main thing I think that has been missing for me is that,
EndUser: So much of the data is, it's really important to be able to represent it in an organization structure view. So you think about a company org chart and that pyramid shape of people.
EndUser: That's something that [PERSON-1], I've coached that out of it with, you know, things that I've picked up on the [PERSON-1] community and. sigmoid functions and it's really complicated.
EndUser: The process of drawing those lines between people on an org chart.
EndUser: So if it did that out of the box, I think there'd just be so many ways to represent that org hierarchy data, not just in HR, but you know, any kind of data that has a hierarchical relationship could just be, it could just really simplify life for people.
EndUser: And then what I do is I have all of these different HR metrics that I then shade the individuals on the org chart according to where they are, let's say, like in a quartile.
EndUser: For example, let's say you have, in my company, we've got about 175 liters. And I want to do behind the scenes a calculation of what the average turnover rate is across the organization.
EndUser: And then anybody who's above that turnover rate, I want their little person icon to be read.
EndUser: And so I've built all that data, that flagging capability on the back end where we could say, okay, show me the leaders who have high turnover or show me the leaders who maybe aren't utilizing the learning system, you know, they don't, they have more than low utilization of LinkedIn learning or something.
EndUser: Just anything you can think of, when you can see it in a hierarchical view and see like a vein of the organization from top to bottom where they consistently are all showing they're above a certain level.
EndUser: That helps you focus on what part of the organization we need to go and work with.
EndUser: So one thing that's really difficult to do is in my company, when you get to really small groups of people, like say you have a manager who has three people, and one of them leaves during [DATE-1].
EndUser: So that works out to be [PERCENT-1] turnover for that leader. Well, statistically, that's not really something that you necessarily need to focus on because it's just such a small insight.
Agent: [NORP-1] and TOP RED
EndUser: But if you're showing on an org chart a whole vein of leaders who are having that higher than average turnover.
EndUser: That helps you address the question, should I pay attention to this or is it just noise?
EndUser: If they're all kind of taught to bottom, having an unusually high turnover rate, then that really helps you focus on that.
EndUser: And that's something that's hard to figure out or observe any other way in any other this style, I think.
EndUser: So that's something that's, I think you guys would just, I think there's just be so many applications for that, to be able to just natively show a personnel structure and then very easily be able to say, okay, based on any attribute, just.
Agent: Yeah, for sure.
EndUser: Colors of people according to that.
Agent: Yeah, definitely. Thank you for sharing that with me, [PERSON-2]. That was really good information and, you know, because that is like a great suggestion.
Agent: Would you?
Agent: Have time maybe on [DATE-2] to sync really quick with the account manager that is helping support the greater adaptive biotech kind of account.
EndUser: Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And when we look at my calendar, Great.
Agent: I have... Yeah, let me know what time on [DATE-3] would maybe work for you.
EndUser: Anytime before [DATE-4], anytime after 2, and before 4. Yeah. Okay.
Agent: Okay, would 1091 work?
Agent: Great, I actually spoke briefly with a non-shreen of [ORG-4] on [DATE-5] while he was kind of in the car and we're going to maybe have a brief conversation on [DATE-3].
Agent: But I can just add you to this calendar invite and so maybe we can have a little group discussion kind of hear a little bit how the different business are using [PERSON-1] as well. That works.
EndUser: Okay. Yeah.
EndUser: And would this be like Zoom or Teams so we could do a screen share?
Agent: Yeah, it'll just be, okay, [ORG-5], and so we'll be able to screen share.

EndUser: So it's literally five, [MONEY-1] ahead. So it's a very affordable solution. design specific for what we do for Security guards and things like that.
EndUser: So I just, I know that that's what really our main initiative right now is what we're working on. And so I just don't see the time or the bandwidth necessary.
EndUser: So you, [PERSON-2], you're welcome to reach out to me at the end of the first quarter kind of and just say there's something that's on our radar.
EndUser: And it probably won't be, like I said, it will be probably something in [DATE-8], [DATE-9] that we could talk about.
Agent: Totally. I am curious. I know, you know, you mentioned kind of you're smaller and you want something that handles sales service marketing.
Agent: I know the last time you looked at us, we didn't have this particular product that [PERSON-3] and I would be recommending it's called [PRODUCT-1]. It's a bit newer that launched in [DATE-10].
Agent: And so I'm happy to send you over a demo for it. It's just like a video video.
Agent: If you could watch it at your leisure, and if it's something that you're like, OK, actually, this would be worth looking at sooner rather than later, let me know.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: I'm happy to get you back on our books for [DATE-8]. And then if not, we can check back in, like you said, in [DATE-15].
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: But I'll send that over to you just so that you have it.
EndUser: What is it?
EndUser: So first of all, what is it called?
EndUser: You're in [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Yeah, it's called [PRODUCT-1]. Yes.
EndUser: Okay.
EndUser: And the second thing you said, what was the thing I looked at?
Agent: [PERSON-3] may have mentioned it. Oh, go ahead.
EndUser: What was the thing I looked at that you said before that you guys didn't have?
EndUser: What was I looking at before that you said?
Agent: Yes. So it looks like the last time you guys evaluated us, you were looking at our Enterprise Edition licenses. And so our Enterprise Edition is great.
Agent: It is kind of like our, it has like the most Integration capabilities and it's the most configurable, I would say, whereas [FAC-2] is more out of the box. So it's a lot more cost effective.
Agent: It still can integrate with some of the solutions that you have. But the big difference here is that Pro Suite includes sales service Marketing all on one platform, whereas [ORG-1] is really just looking at like sales clouds.
EndUser: Okay, got it. So yeah, go ahead and send me the video. That would be great. That'll give me something that you want.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Definitely.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: I'll send it over to you at that same email that I've got here on file. It's just see [GPE-1] at ASAPRWatch.com. And I'll see C-Shot in there.
EndUser: Correct.
Agent: That way, if you've got any questions, you know, we can kind of tag Team C if we can help you out.
Agent: And like I said, if it makes sense to get a call on the calendar to keep talking about it, if it does interest you, happy to set it up.
Agent: And then if not, we'll touch base them later in [DATE-11]. Yeah.
EndUser: Okay, awesome. I'm also going to have my guy, [PERSON-4], who's my IT person, look at it as well.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Because that really, because I'm the idea person and he's the implementation.
Agent: Absolutely.
EndUser: So I will also let [PERSON-5] know.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely.
Agent: Do you want me to go ahead and do you want me to go ahead and include his email?
Agent: I don't think I have it in my system.
EndUser: Sure, I'll give it to you. Sure, I'll give it to you. It's LHSUEH
EndUser: At asepfarwatch.com.
Agent: Okay, I want to make sure I've got that right.
EndUser: L, yeah. Yep.
Agent: [PERSON-6] at ASAPfirewax.com.
EndUser: That's correct.
Agent: Perfect. Okay, I will send you guys both an email with that video link and I look forward to getting your feedback on it.

Agent: Awesome. Yes. Thanks. [PERSON-7]. I appreciate it. Have a good one.

The salesperson also asked about the client's current solution, ""What are you using right now in regards to [FAC-1]?"" to identify potential pain points or areas where the current solution may not be meeting the client's needs.

These questions allowed the sales rep to gather more information about the customer's current situation, their pain points, and their priorities, which helped to identify their intent and tailor the conversation accordingly.",Did the call conclude with clear next steps for both parties? Are there specific action items the buyer needs to complete before moving forward?,"The call did not conclude with clear next steps for both parties. The buyer mentioned that they will have their IT person, [PERSON-4], look at the video and that they will also let [PERSON-5] know.

007967_167_0LQ3y000009rr2YGAQ,"Speaker 2: [PERSON-1]?
Agent: Hi [PERSON-1], this is [PERSON-2] and [ORG-1]'s government account team.
Agent: How are you [DATE-1]?
Speaker 2: I'm all how are you?
Agent: Good. When you spoke [DATE-2], I don't know if you remember, but I had sent you an email surrounding field for [PRODUCT-1], our table at analytics tools.
Agent: I just wanted to see if you got a chance to take a look at and engage your thoughts on it.
Speaker 2: I actually have not. We are a little bit behind on a few other things, but yeah, if you could.
Agent: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: Send it to the top if you don't mind. If you haven't close by, you could bring it back to the top of my inbox. That'd be super helpful.
Speaker 2: And I can certainly get in touch with our team here as we're exploring a few different initiatives.
Agent: Okay, awesome.
Agent: Well, [PERSON-1], do you know, like, top of mind what an issue is you all focus on?
Agent: Just so maybe I can add some more info on my email to you.
Speaker 2: I mean, we've got a number of, you know, organization-wide and also member-wide. So we provide services for our 8 municipal member utilities from varying sizes that serve about 34,000 customers.
Agent: My presentation messages
Speaker 2: So there's a lot of nuance and individual details that are incorporated there. And we also provide some customer-facing programs.
Agent: Over.
Speaker 2: So there's... There's a lot of Enterprise level
Speaker 2: Data filtering that occurs for the organization as a whole and then individual unique characteristics of each member utility.
Agent: Oh, okay. Well, that makes sense.
Agent: What are you all using?
Agent: [PERSON-3] on Mommy asking for the data drive.
Speaker 2: We don't have a [PRODUCT-1] right now.
Agent: Oh, okay. And then if you were looking for that, that makes sense.
Agent: Well, if you all were looking for an ideal [PRODUCT-1], do you know kind of like what you're all looking for in a CRM?
Speaker 2: I mean, I'm familiar with the [ORG-1] product at least in its capabilities, but I do have, you know, underlying concerns that just.
Agent: Right.
Agent: Right?
Speaker 2: Because of the sophistication, even though we're a nonprofit and quasi-governmental organization, I'm not sure that pricing would be within reach just for the size and scope of what we have here. So that's...
Agent: Ah, well.
Speaker 2: I kind of joke as far as affordability goes, but that is quite a very real concern.
Agent: No, that makes sense. I do know that like we work with a lot of nonprofits and excuse me for being not being fully abreast that you all were a nonprofit, but I do partner with my team.
Agent: They are nonprofit side. And I could set you up with one of them. I know that nonprofit has a lot of. They get more discounts than other entities.
Agent: So if you were to speak to someone nonprofit team, they would be able to maybe gauge kind of. what exactly you're looking for and be able to give you a better like sense on pricing.
Agent: I could maybe set that up for you or just send your information. Someone could follow up with you on that side.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that'd be helpful. I mean, I'd be curious to understand what sort of... Models or packages are available for both nonprofits and or government entities.
Speaker 2: We are an authority of the state of [GPE-1], you know, wholly independent but a quasi-governmental entity established through statute.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, there's, there's, there's some ability and obviously our member utilities are full local, locally controlled government entities. So, I'm curious if there's.
Agent: Oh, okay, so that side will be local government, not nonprofit.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, we are also a nonprofit, but yes, there's, it's a very unique situation.
Agent: Okay, how about this?
Agent: How about this?
Agent: I could be because I don't want to send you all to the nonprofit side and they come back to being they say, hey, this isn't completely qualified as a nonprofit, which I do understand that you all are kind of a. non-procterness, a complicated situation.
Agent: But I could set you up with my product specialist, [PERSON-4], and she is, I'll be on the call too, but she could go into details more for you about like the utilities side and kind of what the C-arm would look like for an entity like yourself.
Agent: She'd be able to speak more to it than I can. I don't want to pretend to be a specialist or like tell you the wrong thing, but she can definitely speak to it better than I could.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I would appreciate it. I mean, if you have any documentation that kind of describes the
Speaker 2: Various packages that be helpful as well, I mean, to be honest, I'm not sure that we will have an opportunity to get too deep into it at this very moment.
Speaker 2: We are just onboarding a technology consultant to help us kind of road map out future plans.
Agent: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: But I certainly don't want to lose touch of the capability.
Agent: Right. Oh, right. That makes sense.
Agent: I mean, so then would you say something more something like a [TIME-1] meeting would make sense right now?
Speaker 2: Yeah!
Agent: Like if you were to talk to her as opposed to like I said, talking to me, I don't want to give you the wrong information and she could be a person that would give you more information about like what pricing might look like.
Agent: And this isn't something that I'm saying like, you know, y'all are going to sit down and try to buy something or you're going to sit down and be able to say like, [DATE-1] we're starting something, even if this is something that's going to be.
Agent: A far out situation, I'd say like why not eat the elephant in pieces, you know?
Agent: Like kind of like start out looking something.
Speaker 2: But, Yes, no, I think that would be helpful.
Agent: Okay, what is, what is, do you want to do something [DATE-3], maybe [DATE-4], or do you want to take it out to [DATE-5]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Definitely not [DATE-3] and [DATE-5] I've got a huge regulatory filing. So if we could look closer to [DATE-6], that would be ideal. And yeah, we can go from there.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay, what do you have your calendar on in front of you right now?
Speaker 2: I have a booking link that I can respond to your email. If you ping me, I can respond. That way you can book based on the availability of my calendar.
Agent: Oh, that's perfect. Okay, let me just ping you right now. What I want you to just want me to shoot you an email and then you'll be able to do it that way.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that should work.
Agent: Okay, let me just shoot you over something really quickly.
Agent: All right, so I'll put [ORG-2].
Agent: That feels like, is that the correct abbreviation?
Agent: Is laying [DATE-7]?
Agent: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, vppsa.com. That's a yep.
Agent: Ok, perfect. And then that's the answer.
Agent: Ok, I'll send in to you right now. It's going to come in from the we should not battle ourselves for you.
Speaker 2: Ok, very good.
Agent: Okay, perfect. It should be coming to you right now.
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Agent: Let me know when you get it.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm having some trouble with my email [DATE-1], but I
Speaker 2: Didn't come through yet.
Speaker 2: Okay. I just see it. I will respond now and you can feel free to book something based on the availability.
Agent: Okay, perfect. And then [PERSON-1], just to confirm, you are able to use [ORG-3], like [ORG-4], if I send you a calendar invite to the, okay, perfect.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Agent: Okay, awesome. Then, yeah, I'll send you an invite through that. And then if you could accept that, whatever early it means you have, just so that me and [PERSON-5] also have it on our calendar, so that'll be great.

007618_167_6qr3y000000saLnAAI,"Agent: Hey, [PERSON-1], how are you?
EndUser: Good, good afternoon, how are you?
EndUser: Good, thanks. Pleasure to meet you. Yeah, my question.
Agent: So. Thanks for taking time to meet [DATE-1]. I thought it would just be a good time to do one, just a formal introduction of each other, checking on how everything's going.
Agent: Obviously, [PERSON-2] brought me up to speed about everything that's kind of taking place over [DATE-2].
Agent: And then really just identify either areas that I can Support right now, or be potential projects that we want to potentially allocate resources to.
EndUser: Yep, for enough. No, appreciate that. I guess I can start. I mean, I've been, I'm sure, clear debrief view.
EndUser: We are in the middle of the [ORG-1] implementation, but we did obviously purchase those licenses as well back, right?
EndUser: And so I'm finally good to use some of those licenses. That's consuming [ORG-2] most of my team's time for the next impact. Past [DATE-3] and [DATE-4] here at.
EndUser: And so that's obviously a focus for us. The only other sort of potential focus for us is It's a very small partnership team. I'm sure they're probably [QUANTITY-1] around.
EndUser: We may want to sort of experiment with the partnership cloud or community cloud, whatever it's called, [DATE-5] experience cloud. I always forget. It's never ending change of what those names are. So we can go with that.
EndUser: Yep, exactly. So that maybe through a minor experimentation here, but that's really the thumb of the list.
Agent: Ok. Is there anything you need right off the bat right now regarding the partner community?
EndUser: And I should know this, but remind me, I know there's two different pricing models.
EndUser: One is login base, one's user base, right?
EndUser: And so I think when [PERSON-2] and I lost spoke, it was, you know, relatively minor investment, right?
EndUser: If we were to tinker around with some possibilities.
EndUser: So I guess remind me is, let's just say that we have, you know, a handful of partnerships Count managers, maybe like two or three folks, right?
EndUser: But in terms of actual sort of login, the TSP login to the community, cloud is going to be relatively minor, right?
EndUser: And so. I'm guessing it's going to be more accountable for us to do the logins versus the users.
Agent: That's because I can look at the clear email. Logins are less expensive than the named users, which we'll call members now. And that would just be once again, contingent on how you want to utilize those.
Agent: Or just here and there.
EndUser: So let me talk to my stakeholders internally. I'll apply some issues and do the email for just a quick. very minor quote and very minor logins.
EndUser: This is just a supplications is going to be tiny, right?
EndUser: This is not anything exciting for you, but it's trying to experiment here. Yeah, no worries. It doesn't have to be just here to help.
Agent: So whatever that may look like, no problem.
EndUser: Got you.
Agent: I also met with [PERSON-3] recently just to catch up and introduce myself as well. He had shared his team sounds like they pretty much finished.
Agent: For the most part, [ORG-3] set up in a lot of right now that maybe your team and the extended teams working on is just getting that Integration and connectivity set up with [ORG-4].
Agent: Is that correct?
EndUser: Yeah, that's correct in the high level. So we did Go Live with one of our segments, one of our bigger segments. We do have plans to roll it out into future phases with additional segments.
EndUser: And yes, pretty much in sort of post-support phase for that one lab segment, including [ORG-5] that you mentioned, right?
EndUser: So that kind of the look [DATE-1] is making sure that [ORG-6] works.
Agent: And how has that been going so far doing the integration?
Agent: Because you guys are doing it just in-house custom, correct?
Agent: Yeah, we are doing in-house.
EndUser: So it's going a bit of a loaded question, but if you were, if you were for me, like we would do it differently, right?
EndUser: But I'm also not. not IT right. And so, yeah, we're working through it.
EndUser: So we have internal resources doing the Integration definitions, right?
EndUser: So we're working through it.
Agent: Okay, got it. If anything does come up, feel free to reach out. Anything else top of mind, anything else right now that I can assist with, anything that you think would be coming up that.
Agent: Might be helpful for me to know?
EndUser: No, I think, like I said, I think we're focused on [ORG-3].
EndUser: I'll engage with you if we need to also increase the footprint as we do different segments, right?
EndUser: But I think we're good for now. And I'll talk with you if we need to look at the partner community.
Agent: Ok, great. If anything else comes up, you have my email, my phones in my signature as well. Please don't hesitate to reach out. Otherwise, I'll look forward to your email about any information you need on the partner communities.
Agent: And I don't know if it makes sense. I know it's very premature right now. If you want to establish any touch points throughout [DATE-6], whether it's just biweekly [DATE-7] check-ins, I do know just long term.
Agent: [PERSON-2] shared the, you know, this end desk evaluation.
Agent: So I just, if there's anything that does come up along that as well, want to make sure that I'm staying on top of it and, you know, supporting you guys whenever you need. No
EndUser: Good question. I don't think we did a periodic check in. Um, all season desk and service cloud.
EndUser: I mean, I'm also not the kid for Service Cloud given through my past experience, right?
EndUser: And so, um, [PERSON-4] and I will through internally push continue to push for that. Right. Uh, but until we get to a point where that's another conversation with all of you.
EndUser: I don't think we need to talk, but we can certainly look in as we get closer to those potential decision points, right?
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: Sounds good.
Agent: Last two questions for me are where are you based?

Agent: Can't imagine how many announcements you guys have. I was on the website and I was pretty impressed with all the announcements on the map on [GPE-1]. That's pretty amazing.

EndUser: But yeah, I'm just not, I don't think we're currently using it, but potentially it could be something that we've had to our toolbox, you know.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, in [PERSON-1] is great for data visualization. We do a lot of stuff with public-facing dashboards as well as internal dashboards.
Agent: I guess in terms of what you were looking to potentially get some of the visualizations for, I mean, what would that specifically look like?
Agent: I guess where are you trying to have like in the visualizations?
EndUser: Well, what I do is I do the employment projections for the state of [GPE-1], so I do [DATE-1] and [DATE-2] projections.
EndUser: So I don't know if it would have any use from with helping me with those, but maybe, you know, we use some specific software for that.
EndUser: So I don't know if that would have an application there, but I was thinking more for, you know, when I present the data and, you know, things like that. But, but again, I'm not super familiar with [PERSON-1] either.
EndUser: But so I'm not exactly sure exactly how it would help, but I think it could.
Agent: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think it could definitely be something you could use for visualization presenting. I mean, we have [QUANTITY-1] of people in the state that are currently using it, leveraging the platform. And I'm not sorry.
Agent: I'm not the most technical on terms of what it can do for you. You know, I'm not sure if you've interested.
Agent: I know super busy time of [DATE-3] to schedule is a little bit tough, but I mean, we have a dedicated team that supports your state specifically in regards to [PERSON-1], and they'd be more than happy to meet [PERSON-2] and my mother.
Agent: It's [TIME-1]. Whatever works for you, just to kind of do a little bit more in depth can show you some of what's being done on [PERSON-1].
Agent: Just present a little bit more and then learn a little bit more about what you would potentially like to possibly use it for and just share some of the work we're doing with it and understand, you know, what you're looking for and see if there's a potential fit there.
EndUser: Yeah, sure, sure. I think that would, that could be good.
Agent: Yeah. Okay. Perfect.
Agent: Um, you know, when would be, I mean, would [DATE-4] work for you?
Agent: I know we're getting close to holiday season. So it gets tough. scheduling.
EndUser: Yeah, it is going to be a little bit, a little bit tough with the holidays and everything coming up. I'm not entirely sure when might be a good time.
EndUser: And then I'm going to be out of town here starting [DATE-4]. So I don't know if maybe we should wait till after the holidays. I might be a better idea.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, so you're going to be out [DATE-5]. I guess what you're saying.
EndUser: I'm going to, from [DATE-6] on, but we have an all employee meeting on [DATE-7]. And, and, and, yeah. So we're, you know, that I meet with someone in person or just remotely.
Agent: It could be done over [ORG-1] meets is typically what we use. What we could do teams if that works better. It would probably be virtually.
EndUser: Yeah. Okay.
Agent: Let me see.
EndUser: Yeah. Well, maybe, maybe [DATE-8] or something if there's some time.
Agent: Yeah, let me check the calendars real quick while I got you on here and make it easier to schedule and stuff over email can get a little wonky. Let's see.
Agent: Mm, let's see, [DATE-9]. [TIME-2] or [TIME-3]'s better for you.
EndUser: Um, maybe, maybe [TIME-3].
Agent: [TIME-4] on [DATE-10], let's see.
Agent: I'm pretty free. Let me show, I got to, I'm trying to coordinate some calendars with my people on the [PERSON-1] and here.
Agent: I guess what I can do if it works is I'll check [DATE-9] [TIME-3] on a couple people's calendars and I can send over other send over like four or five times on [DATE-9].
Agent: For [DATE-14] and if one of those works for you to shoot me an email and I'll send over a calendar invite for that time. If it doesn't work on [DATE-9] and.
Agent: I know you'll be out the rest of [DATE-14], we can look to [DATE-12] as well to have the meeting but more than happy to make it work with your schedule, obviously.
EndUser: Okay, sounds good.
Agent: Alright, perfect. Well, I will shoot over that email here shortly with a couple times. If something works on [DATE-9], great. I can send it over and we can meet then.
Agent: If not, then find some other times that work as well.

004188_167_6qr3y000000ocZUAAY,"Agent: I'll share it in [ORG-1] after. So here's what the Enterprise license agreement looks like. So the rough numbers that you and I had spoken about was using say like 97 number of licenses on the ELA.
Agent: Just to give you some again, we have talked about this, but since the recording, you purchased 12 licenses on an ELA previously.
Speaker 2: Metrics,
Agent: Your current [DATE-1] active users is 43 or [DATE-2]. And then what happens on an ELA is you buy for the number of users of where you're at, but then once you exceed that license count, everything is free.
Agent: So that's the situation that we're in [DATE-3], is you purchased for 13, for example, that was your user account when you purchased. And you guys quickly exceeded that good faith estimate.
Agent: So everything you're getting right now is considered free, but especially with the incremental licenses that we've seen, that's why [PERSON-1] flagged it. So the pro of getting on an ELA is you get Unlimited growth.
Agent: The negative is that you might have to buy a few more licenses so that we can protect our interest on it as well.
Agent: Is that fair?
Agent: Does that make sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Compare that to the UELA and what the QELA does is that allows you to set a lower license count up front But then there's true ups if you go over that number Within [DATE-4] period So instead of using 85 for example, we might use 37 for that initial purchase But once you exceed 46 to say let's you get you get to 77 We send you a true up for that 26 license cost And then at [DATE-5], true up, your license count restarts at 65.
Agent: So it's just a matter if you want to build in some growth and then have that free growth beyond that, or if you don't want the shelfware. It's got it.
Speaker 2: So I think more likely than that, the [DATE-6] is what they're going to go for. I think I misspoke earlier and it's just said this straight, ELA. I think [DATE-6] would be more likely what they go for.
Speaker 2: As far as payment. So I know from the most part you pay for when you're upfront.
Agent: We don't have a situation where I get flagged by [LAW-1] because we'll just we'll do the true of instead and you'll only pay for what you need Rather so the ELA is really good when you're at 87 [DATE-3] You think at [DATE-7] you'll get 166 and we do 144 But that
Speaker 2: With when there's kind of this you know uncertainty in the air of growth And I think the QLA better supports what you're looking to do No, perfect.
Speaker 2: It makes no sense So I mean, if you want to send another meeting for maybe let's say [DATE-8] [TIME-1].
Agent: Definitely.
Speaker 2: Okay, perfect. It should via a meeting instead of us any email.
Agent: Be better for me. Obviously, to follow
Speaker 2: [DATE-8] [TIME-1] or round
Agent: Two, if that works for you. That's perfect. So I apologize. I'm actually off
Speaker 2: [DATE-8] [TIME-1].
Speaker 2: Can you do [DATE-9] [TIME-2]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll
Agent: Find something [DATE-9] [TIME-2]. I'll send it over and if that time doesn't work, just let me know. I guess a [DATE-9] [TIME-2] after [DATE-10]. [DATE-9] [TIME-2] after [DATE-10]. OK, perfect. I'll also I'll get to work on the quote.
Agent: I think it sounds ultimately going to look like.
Speaker 2: Like we're pretty aligned on what the quotes speak on [DATE-9], but I just want to make sure that we're ready to go so we could stick that 13th date.
Agent: I won't send it out yet until we [PRODUCT-1].
Speaker 2: Sounds like a plan. All right. Awesome, [PERSON-2].
Speaker 2: Anything else I can help with?
Speaker 2: No, no, that was to make sure, obviously, you got the deadline and you understand, like, be done before we start closing it.
Agent: I just wanted
Agent: Obviously, everything has to for [DATE-7]. Yeah. So I didn't want you to think it was all and going right and thinking. So I kind of get you an idea of what's going on. That's perfect.
Agent: And it's always really nice to have a timeline that isn't like there's actually a time that we're working against.

* The client's willingness to consider the Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) option, which offers unlimited growth, but requires buying additional licenses if the user count exceeds the initial purchased amount.
* The client's preference for the Quarterly Enterprise License Agreement (QELA) option, which allows for a lower initial license count and true-ups for additional licenses used.
* The client's uncertainty about growth and desire to avoid ""shelfware"" (unused licenses).

005682_167_6qr3y000000ogdDAAQ,"Agent: Yeah. Thank you.
EndUser: Um, yeah. Okay.
EndUser: So what I recall when we first, one of the first conversations we had, um, one of the options that we talked about was essentially getting, um, creating two users, right?
EndUser: Where one was only going to have access to the, like, community. And the other one was going to only have access to the support site. And so I know one of the concerns there was, right, it's two users.
EndUser: It breaks the whole like one stop shop kind of moving, transitioning easily from one two the other [ORG-1], different user names, all that kind of stuff. So I know we at that point ditched that option.
EndUser: Um, essentially what [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] have been talking through is a little bit of a hybrid, I would say. I don't think it completely resolves the issue from a workaround perspective, but I think it certainly minimizes the impact.
EndUser: So ultimately what they're deciding, what they were testing out, um, was instead of doing different users, um, splitting it up in different profiles. So essentially with three, like one user and each user is assigned one of three profiles.
EndUser: Option one would be a profile that exclusively gets access to the support home. The other user or the other profile would give exclusive access to the community. And then the third one.
EndUser: Is for those users that essentially would get access to both, which probably is a smaller subset. And it would essentially prevent anybody with that support only profile to see anybody that's in the community.
EndUser: We know from the community side, that's not an issue. So we're not really worried about that profile.
EndUser: And then it would only be the users that are like in that middle of that [PERSON-3] diagram, if you put it if you put it together like that, that would still have.
EndUser: A little more access to see some of the other users, but they would see in any ways because they're already part of both, like both sides, so to say, in the first place.
Agent: So, yes, I'm sorry, [PERSON-4].
Agent: So just as you were saying, so this is, you know, with this separation of the profile, What the advantage is just to kind of spell this out is that you wouldn't necessarily need to create users in each of the system.
Agent: So these would work off of a shared user profile. But what we're able to do at this point is move some of the functionality that I think was kind of built into the lightning component.
Agent: And give that capability, that granularity now to that visual force component because of the provisioning of the separation of the profiles at this point.
Agent: So we'll be able to give that granularity now to the visual force component if those profiles are now set up.
Agent: You know, I guess the negative, the con of this would be it makes the provisioning of of adding new users, just one more step But now we're getting that granularity, it looks like .
Agent: Sorry to bump in their mail.
Agent: Yeah, no worries. Yeah, no. Thanks for explaining this, [PERSON-4]. I have a couple of thoughts here. So the profiles is, I think that is how we actually set up right now.
Agent: We do have separate profiles that can give access to one community, depending on what the register on the website for. They either get a community or a community support center, but also the profiles are separated.
Agent: But [PERSON-4], remember how you're talking about the vendor, I can run the intersection area, the central space. It's not a few, most of our customers are in that area. That is the main problem.
Agent: That means that most of our customers, they're registered for community, I mean, collaboration community, as well as support central. In fact, I would say everybody in general, are on both communities. So switching between two profiles was difficult.
Agent: That is why one of the reasons I've been, correct me if I'm wrong, our community users basically gives access to both communities, once the resistor. So it's there by default. It's the collaboration community is there for you.
Agent: So that's where the challenge is.
EndUser: So what you're saying is essentially you either have access to the community or you have access to both. There really isn't a third option.
Agent: Right. Yes, it's generally got to both most of the most of the customers are in that intersection area having. All right. See, OK. Well.
EndUser: Um,
EndUser: We definitely, I think, work under the assumption that it's a smaller subset, but okay. Um,
EndUser: I guess back to the drawing board, maybe.
EndUser: I'm sorry. No, no, don't be sorry at all. I think we're all sorry.
Agent: Okay. Well, then I think, and it would, yeah, we'll, we'll catch up with [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] as well, because for some reason, it seemed like they tested something and something worked, but let's.
EndUser: Make sure that it did work. But yeah, it did work.
EndUser: But I think, again, we were working under the assumptions that the overlap in the bend diagram is a smaller subset where in reality, it's either the full left or or only the right.
Agent: Okay. Okay. All right. I'm going to chase down [PERSON-2] no matter what [DATE-1], [LOC-1], and then kind of catch up with him. And I have no issues if we want to just catch up with the three of us.
Agent: I know that [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-6] are holding their time over just to catch up on this call, but we could catch up with him separately. But then meanwhile, yeah, we will go back to the drawing board.
Agent: Two sounds good.
EndUser: I've never seen so many people work so hard [DATE-2] and [EVENT-1]. Right. OK, well.

007517_167_6qr3y000000ogcoAAA,"Agent: Okay, great. So the Recording has started. Thank you very much for making yourself available for this quick catch up on on one [PRODUCT-1]. So I hope everything's going well on your side at [ORG-1] and [ORG-2].
Agent: Maybe before jumping into the few slides I have. Can you can you share with me a few updates on the Once you're on project, initiatives .
EndUser: Yeah, of course. And thanks for making the time also on your side, [PERSON-1]. Yeah, so I think things are progressing well.
EndUser: We are in, yeah, and we're making good progress internally to determine how we want to build certain things around once you're in. So that way you can also, so that we can actually start implementing in [DATE-1].
EndUser: I think we're on track for that. We're very excited to get that started.
EndUser: And we'll start with the replacement of [ORG-3] at first and then expand it into [LOC-1] and then we'll add [PERSON-2] to that mix later on as well.
EndUser: But also good to see like okay besides [PRODUCT-2], but we are also looking at other communication channels. So yeah, figured it would be good to have this catch up.
Agent: Yeah, so as mentioned, [PERSON-3] and Cloud and with powered by [ORG-4] is actually a great way to centralize all of your engagements channels for your customers.
Agent: So initially our conversation was mainly around email and a bit of push notifications.
Agent: And [DATE-2] the idea is actually to share with you a broader approach on mobile, particularly on any SMS and maybe we can talk about [ORG-5], which is very, very hot [DATE-3] And we can continue our conversations around that .
Agent: Does that work for you?
EndUser: Sounds good, man. Absolutely.
Agent: Okay, great. So I have a few slides. Let me grab them.
Agent: There it is. So I've been working, obviously, with the...
EndUser: Yeah, I can see the screen.
Agent: I was working with the rest of the team, with [PERSON-4], [PERSON-5], and [GPE-1], everyone you know. just to share this recap on the value that [ORG-6] brings for your SMS initiative.
Agent: What I understand is right now, your SMS engagements are powered to O-Hange business services, Yes, that is correct.
EndUser: That's correct?
Agent: Ok, great. So the idea here is actually to get the full power of our platform, [ORG-6], by putting this SMS channel into the platform.
Agent: And actually, it's natively embedded in the solution, so you don't really have any Implementation phase to go through. It's part of what you have already started.
Agent: And This whole SMS will actually, this channel will actually be orchestrated in the same interface than your email, than From all your data.
EndUser: Your push.
Agent: So you'll
EndUser: Have your journey builder. You choose to share. That will be my question. Is that
Agent: The same journey builder?
Agent: Yeah, it's exactly that. So basically you have one technology platform. So on the IT side, you have little to no integration. And for the business slash marketing side, well, this mobile studio is embedded in the interface.
Agent: So it's not a second interface for your employees to learn, to pass through, et cetera. Everything takes place
EndUser: In the same place. Okay.
Agent: Yeah, that sounds good.
Agent: So the idea is really to have a unified customer interaction at [DATE-4] for your passengers, but I also know you work with you, you send SMS to as well, but everyone has this consistent and coherent experience since it's powered through the same database and through the same journey orchestration module.
EndUser: Your employees
Agent: So that's really the benefit of the platform. And obviously in terms of performance, it will definitely be more effective because you will be able to synchronize when your SMS sends when you're sending emails.
Agent: Sometimes, you might prefer receiving an email. You're more sensitive to emails. You'll send emails. You'll receive emails. I'm on the other hand. I'm way more SMS to me.
EndUser: Sensitive to SMS. [PERSON-6]: So instead of being in a let's say siloed approach on your SMS like you might be [DATE-2], just shooting and blasting your SMS, here we're
EndUser: Doing it in a more holistic way and smarter way where your customers.
Agent: And how long would it take us for, would it take for us to get this up running?
Agent: Well, it's basically, it's pretty fast depending on, let's say, two things. First of all, just the time for you to finish your [PERSON-3] and Cloud implementation.
EndUser: It's pretty obvious, but it's
Agent: This is done. So minimum three two let's say, [DATE-5], you can have it up.
EndUser: Let's say
Agent: And there's just for SMS mobile codes, configuration, some delays that can be.
Agent: On top for I think [GPE-2] or a few countries it might take [DATE-6] to configur e the mobile Code but most of them really most of them there except one or for like an d One week activation.
EndUser: Two [ORG-7] most of them are
Agent: That's the answer, self-promising. Yeah.
Agent: So what else did I did I have here?
Agent: So I mean, that's something we covered. Maybe one important thing to keep in mind is that mobile experience for your customers isn't only SMS.
EndUser: We actually
Agent: Have the push notifications and what's up. That what's up are being really, really big [DATE-3]. It's actually growing super fast and we have a strategic plan. partnership with them.
Agent: And that's why since, I think, [DATE-7], [ORG-5] is also just like [ORG-8] directly embedded So same way, it's actually a shorter activation .
EndUser: In the platform.
Agent: But in the same way, you can reach out to your passengers directly through WhatsApp and what's really nice with WhatsApp. I would say two things to keep in mind.
Agent: It's not just sending an SMS where it's pretty much going one way. You're sending an SMS to inform your customer. It's actually an opportunity to have
EndUser: A conversation with your customer. It's a little bit hot. So they can also directly respond to that.
Agent: Exactly, and that's really nice for when you have a customer service challenge, you can use WhatsApp. When you have boarding, for example, when you need your customer to check in, they could use WhatsApp as an entry point.
Agent: These are the best practices we see in the industry. So it's really nice. The other aspect is the price. here with WhatsApp, you actually go through a conversation, you can send several messages.
Agent: So, [DATE-4], compared to SMS, WhatsApp is most of the time less expensive for your sense.
EndUser: Guys, yeah, I would say sounds really promising.
Agent: I'm looking forward to receiving your commercial proposal on this. Yeah, well, we're still working on it with the team here. I'll let you have a quick look at the document I'll share with you the slides.
Agent: But we're also working on the recap of the business value for your 1CM project.
EndUser: For
Agent: I'll leave this. It has many value drivers customer experience, and IT.
EndUser: Across business,
Agent: Feel free once you've taken a look at this document to ask me any question.
EndUser: Perfect. Thanks a lot for I'll make sure to have another look at it.
Agent: Prepping this, [PERSON-1].

EndUser: From there, if I was pushed to sales loft, I'm on her profile, I can throw her in a cadence, I can start taking action.

Agent: So with sales cadences, like the Sales Engagement function, that's gonna be, you can pull that into your cadence, and then you can start working it from there. I guess like my question is, are you trying to, yes.
Agent: So basically within inbox, [ORG-1] inbox, if you open that up, like that panel up, queue, and that will get turned on when [ORG-2] gets turned on.
EndUser: It's gonna give you a work
Agent: So then you will be able to take action on that, Yeah, so you'll see it probably set up [DATE-1], but you will have a like a sales queue that will pop up within your outlook.
EndUser: To begin with. Yeah, so this will automatically pop up if I'm looking at a client email. But because it's coming from our who the profile is.
Agent: [PERSON-2], it doesn't identify
EndUser: Oh, okay.
EndUser: You know what I mean?
EndUser: And so like over here, I guess that maybe the search bar is the like to have it pinned because then way to do it.

Agent: And then also for her to provide some recommendations on how might we pull more of like the [PERSON-3] profile into or like, you know, what does that email coming in?
Agent: What would that have to contain for you to just pull it into your cadence directly from your outlook?
Agent: Um, I guess like my question is, so you mentioned that the account name wasn't pulling in from do you have to like manually in?
EndUser: Marchetto. So like add So the just from [ORG-1]. So I figured out build these and use a certain merge fields.
Agent: How to
EndUser: I like job board This fills in a blank.

EndUser: So it's definitely, the answers they've given me.

Agent: Do you have a go like that yet?

EndUser: Yeah, okay. So simply look what we are trying to do here to integrate [ORG-2] with [ORG-1]. We're the add ons in [ORG-1] and it's already there.
Agent: Able to have
EndUser: We installed it and it's working fine. But the thing is we are not able to find the part of [ORG-2], the [ORG-1] in [ORG-2].
EndUser: So as you know that we have two addons, one will be installed in [ORG-2] and the add on will be installed in [ORG-1].
Agent: So this
EndUser: Lag and [ORG-2] we are not able to find. We search out, we are going to, maybe basic to search in the internet, we are not having this add-ons package.
EndUser: So that's why we are going to help us to find solution to install that package.
Agent: Perfect. So it's basically an additional, it's an application within, [ORG-2] that you're trying to integrate into this so you can
Agent: Simply send, like it said, sending information into channels and that sort of thing.
EndUser: Exactly. Yes.
Agent: So being able to send maybe an opportunity or a And
Agent: Directly into a dedicated sales channel from [ORG-2].
EndUser: Yes. Okay,
Agent: Perfect. So yeah, so let me have a look and see. Oh, thank you, [PERSON-1].
Agent: Is that an automated node system?
Agent: That's very good.
EndUser: So you can see my screen?
EndUser: Yes, I can. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so this add-ons Slack itself, we are able and it's still already.
Agent: Which is a package and to install
EndUser: So we can receive and see the messages, it is working fine.
Agent: But the thing is in [ORG-2] side, we are not able to have this package related to [ORG-1].
Agent: Okay, so you're able to pull information from [ORG-2] into [ORG-1], but what you want to do now is push information from [ORG-2] side into [ORG-1] itself on a kind of a case-by-case basis or whatever information you're looking to try.
Agent: Try and
Agent: Send across
EndUser: Ok, [PERSON-2],
EndUser: Thanks for joining
Agent: Hurry up, we're doing well Everyone's thanks OK . Thank you. Well, [PERSON-3] was just kind of explaining there is that it's more to do with [ORG-2] itself.
Agent: And there's like an application or to integrate [ORG-1] into [ORG-2] itself as opposed to the [ORG-2] app in [ORG-1]. It's the other way around. It's the [ORG-1] app in [ORG-2].
Agent: So I think what I did find a short video on [ORG-3] [DATE-1] around how you can integrate the two. I'm not sure.
EndUser: How exactly that would work with regards to [ORG-2] or the same thing. Again, look not to cut you off here.
EndUser: Actually, in my ex-company, we are doing the integration, and the thing is there's small package, it sells for [ORG-1] and sells for. So we are able to install that one.
EndUser: But right now, this package is not more in the system. We cannot install it. We are searching for that package. It's not there.
EndUser: That's why I'm not sure if we can find it in your end or you can support from your add-ons
Agent: End to have this [ORG-1] to install in [ORG-2] itself Okay . Yeah, okay. So thanks for that.
Agent: I think what we need to figure out is a little bit more around the, um, how do we do it from this, it's from the sales force side. So do we, yeah. [PERSON-2], is there an additional
Agent: Add-on or anything that they need to include as part of their [ORG-2] product?
Agent: I was just a bit to ask actually because you guys are using [PRODUCT-1] as well. So there could be an option to use [PRODUCT-1] to kind of create that Integration as well.
Agent: Is that something you guys have kind of delved into a little bit or enough, quite just?
EndUser: I know they are not using the influence of foreign integration.
Agent: Okay, so. Excuse me, there is [PRODUCT-1] on your contract. Okay, so that will come with a number of integrations as well.
Agent: What we might do is maybe set up a call with the [PRODUCT-1] team and see if we can get some resources for you guys on how to create the full Integration between [ORG-1] and [ORG-2], [ORG-2] and [ORG-1], because I think it's pretty much out of the box.
Agent: So if that's not something you guys have explored yet, I'm happy to do a little bit of research and see if that can help as well.
EndUser: I don't need like a [ORG-4] application for integration.
Agent: You guys actually already have me all soft, so you can use it if you want.
Agent: It seems to be pretty straightforward though, [PERSON-2].
Agent: Shouldn't that mean because the two obviously should be very well connected?
Agent: It's just about how do we find the right link?
Agent: We're basically trying to find that link between the two.
Agent: But
Agent: Where is that sitting within your?
Agent: Salesforce instance at the moment because I don't know why it shouldn't connect. It should why you can't find it when you open your [ORG-2].
Agent: I'm not overly familiar, I know obviously [ORG-2] can be different for every company so it looks a bit different and acts a little bit differently.
Agent: But I'm guessing that it maybe should be within somewhere within the apps section of your [ORG-2]
Agent: Okay, so yeah, this is the [ORG-1]. Sorry, this is the [ORG-2] app for [ORG-1]. But what we're looking now at is the other way around. So the [ORG-1] app for [ORG-2] basically.
EndUser: Yes, exactly. Actually, we don't need any systems for integration. It's very simple. We have this one and we have the request, which is needed to [ORG-1]. So now we are able to do this one.
EndUser: That's why it's already been in the system. It's open, not installed. So before we have the same, but for [ORG-1], once we are click installed, it will be installed inside, here.
Agent: This is for itself installation.
EndUser: So we have the internal is done.
Agent: Everything
EndUser: But the thing is, we are not able to install from the app [PRODUCT-2]. Let me show you here.
EndUser: Now, before it's just opening and you can install direct, but now it's Okay.
Agent: Sending us to
EndUser: New web. So, if I'm going to search for that one,
EndUser: You wouldn't even find it. It was here before this one. So the app itself is not there. The package itself So, yeah.
Agent: Is not there. Okay. So, yeah.
EndUser: So, yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah.
Agent: So, yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah.
Agent: I mean, it doesn't make sense why it wouldn't
EndUser: Be there. Because
EndUser: Actually, we can not connect from like, from a select to [ORG-2].
EndUser: Yeah. There is a error message.
EndUser: App is not wrong.
EndUser: Yeah, did you have this error message, [PERSON-4]?
EndUser: So we can share it
EndUser: With just one here.
Agent: Yeah, yeah, it might just be the case guys that we need to reach out to our technical support team and see if this solution here because you know, it might just be hidden from the app exchange at yeah, if you can take a screenshot the moment.
Agent: So
Agent: Of what you're seeing. I'm Recording this call [PERSON-2]. So we'll send
Agent: The Recording across
EndUser: Perfect. Okay
Agent: Yeah, that's You're within the [ORG-1] is a [ORG-1] app directory as opposed to the [ORG-2] app directory.
EndUser: App now. So this
Agent: But yeah, for some reason it's hidden in the [ORG-2] which, yeah, okay.
EndUser: App directory
Agent: Okay, well, let's get this Recording across to somebody in the team and maybe we can figure it out for us. Maybe we have a solution hopefully pretty quickly for you. But Thanks very much for your time.
Agent: I'm probably sure you couldn't get it all fixed right now, but hopefully we can have a very appreciate.
EndUser: Solution for you pretty soon though. That's Thank

Agent: There is, at least at the macro level, is something called B2B [ORG-4], and it allows you and the team to look at the revenue, the pipeline that's being generated from marketing assets, like forums, landing pages, and anything, any assets on those, as well as looking at that across the accounts from that outlook.
Agent: And then it can go all the way down on the micro level of helping you. and the sales team actually see literally what people at your customers are engagin g with, like which assets .
Agent: And you are maybe the most engaged.
Agent: And we can even take that one step further and help you start to pull all that with [ORG-5] and start to understand key accounts, people who are likely to convert into revenue driving opportunities based off of their engagement with your assets.

EndUser: Right now, 28.
EndUser: We're probably, you know, I mean, definitely going to increase that [DATE-1], right?
EndUser: Right off the bat, probably in Q1 will probably increase it by, you know, four or five. Okay.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay So we're going to one- So I think what would be helpful.

Agent: Have a general sense for kind of like what you need right now. It would be really helpful if you can look into how much of those Integration efforts your team can take Because A, that's going to factor into.
EndUser: On.
Agent: A, costs, but B, honestly, more importantly, like whether or not we're kind of the right fit for a project like
EndUser: This. Yeah.
Agent: And then [PERSON-1], I'd say on our side too, it's like, you know, because it's a new environment, we're thinking more in the long term, right, investment, and we can discount the E and he only needs sales in the first place.
Agent: So. I think just running numbers, you and I can go over and then if there's any other integrations that we need to address, it's just about bringing down the total cost. Yeah.
Agent: Yeah. So, yeah. So if you look into that and then we can kind of regroup. And if we're not like the right fit, I'm sure [NORP-1] slash, yeah, we can connect you with someone who can support that.
EndUser: Yeah, we can get more clarity.
EndUser: Yeah, we do have, you know, we do have a consultant on the [ORG-3] side, right, that helps us out with some things, right, so we can always engage them as well if this, you know, if we're looking for different options, right?

Agent: Actual needs are. Yeah.

Agent: [ORG-3] and your proprietary tool. I don't know enough about this kind

EndUser: And really kind of scope it out. But given where we are like in [DATE-5], [NORP-1], one of the things I think if we couldn't look at is a [DATE-6] extension, right, some of these things.

EndUser: Yep.
Agent: I'll talk
EndUser: With [PERSON-2] about a courtesy. Okay.

EndUser: So it's not like a general public offering that we have, right?
EndUser: Similar to, okay?

007392_167_6qr3y000000oiMZAAY,"Agent: And so really I'm trying to see how far we could push the capabilities of [ORG-1], [FAC-1] team and us believe that we just don't think that we're actually would be the best solution for y'all to help out with SES main tool.
Agent: We don't want to position something.
Agent: Again, we did our due diligence, right?
Agent: We initially at a high level, we had our initial conversations and the first kind of pass through and the same path through, we thought we could really help.
Agent: Um, rather further conversations again, I just don't think I'm good cautious.
Agent: We could say that we can meet your teams needs and be a true value admin organization like we can with the other sales sports offerings, your team is ready. I'm adopted. So that's why we shortened this call.
Agent: Um, we don't want to waste any more of your time.
Agent: Um, but yeah, and other [PERSON-1] might, I think you might be a lot a little more clarity, but, uh, but yeah, I guess I just want to respect your time and thank you all for.
Agent: Including us and allowing us to really dive into your processes.
Agent: Sorry, I don't know about the news your team was like hoping for looking for, but we'll try to get stewards as partners. And let you all know what we, you know, what our second was.
Speaker 5: Yeah, I think from what I did, the documents that you shared, I sat down with one of our [ORG-2] experts and kind of walked through there. And I think.
Speaker 5: Where we started to see a potential issue is that there's a ton of data entry for locations and square footage and things like that would need to be plugged in to feed the calculations.
Speaker 5: We didn't see anything necessarily in the calculations and all of that you're putting together to get to a price that you're sharing with customers, but there's a lot of data entry to get there.
Speaker 5: Now that said, it's Can you do that in [ORG-3]?
Speaker 5: Absolutely.
Speaker 5: Can you put together a user interface that would even make that a reasonably efficient process?
Speaker 5: Yes, you can do that as well.
Speaker 5: We didn't get time to share [DATE-1], but we have another client that we work with, a similar industry, they're doing custodial work, but it's not yours is more ongoing, we're showing up twice a week kind of stuff.
Speaker 5: This is more a deep cleaning on your hardwood floors and your, the stone around the elevators and things like that.
Speaker 5: But similar concept, what floors are involved, square footage, materials, the things like that, we put together a user interface with them that would plug into it and put all of that together.
Speaker 5: But that project was because they wanted to use [ORG-3] all the way through. It wasn't just a, we're entering that information so that we can develop a quote and send that out.
Speaker 5: It's because the information needs to be entered at some point because when we get the job, we're also using where that transfers to the operations side and we're also using that for scheduling resources to show up and timing and things like that so that all that data entry has to happen at some point but building it into the mechanism for CPU made sense because later on you're going to need it anyway.
Speaker 5: It's entirely possible. It costs something to do that. There's some additional complexities to it. I don't want to leave the impression that [ORG-2] can't do this, that and the other.
Speaker 5: But it makes sense if there's some future stage operation side to it. And that hasn't been part of the conversation at this point.
Speaker 5: At this point, we've got a couple of overworked people in the estimations team that was hoping for a more efficient path to get there. I don't know that I had that this is
Agent: Going to be more efficient within that window. Yeah. And so I guess it could elaborate a little bit further on that part too.
Agent: But again, with your team's angle of doing an export, right, essentially to then put it into another form message, it just didn't seem like again, it'd be something that'd be worth the hard earned time and cost for your team and never take on.
Agent: So.
EndUser: We appreciate the transparency and just the honesty. Definitely didn't want to go down a path that didn't make sense. And like you guys, we also saw some potential flaws.
EndUser: So not completely surprised, but appreciate everyone's time they put into this and putting together the demos and going through our information.
Agent: Yeah, really, just piggyback off of what [PERSON-2] said. Appreciate everybody's time and. Thank you for your transparency. We would have liked to be a tool that would have worked.
Agent: But I understand based on what challenges we thought would be would face too, based on having to export and all that. But thank you again for sharing and doing the demos.
Agent: And if there's, if something comes up, right, there's another tool, especially ideally when the common sales source that exists out there, we'll be more than happy to pass on those recommendations of other vendors if we run into them, which is our current offering [DATE-2].
Agent: Just, yeah, I think it would be enough
Speaker 6: Value for your team. Guys, if I could ask you, of course, we keep looking for to help us.
Speaker 6: What would be the main challenge?
Speaker 6: Not protective.
Speaker 5: From, I think from what I was, I mean, I, one of the examples you sent, it was, I think it was [ORG-4] custodial, for example, and there was a one of the tabs on there, I think it was just called square footage.
Speaker 5: And there was like two dozen, three dozen locations, and you know, there's, you know, how many floors and how much square footage and you have to refer to around and things like that.
Speaker 5: It's the data entry piece of it where it started to not make sense.
Speaker 5: And so like I said, we did it for another company where the data entry had to happen at some point, it might as well happen now, at the beginning of the quoting process.
Speaker 5: But it's because there was a, after the sale was closed, that data gets shifted over. And now it's a job that needs to be staffed and scheduled and doing all of that.
Speaker 5: And all of that was being done in [ORG-3] who had made sense to, at the beginning of the market. create some systems for efficient data entry to get that information in.
Speaker 5: But if it's just we need to get that in so that we can calculate and generate the numbers, but then post-sale, the work is happening somewhere else. It was a big investment for not enough gain.
Agent: [PERSON-1], do you think that maybe, again, I know you came out of the list, this is out there, and it's escaping off the bottom of the head right now.
Agent: But they should go look at like a traditional like a certainia or something like that. They're going to be doing the inputs anyway.
Speaker 5: Yeah. But I don't know. I couldn't give a recommendation with the. Yeah, you should go buy this kind of a kind of a level.
Speaker 6: Okay. Thank you guys. Appreciate. Yeah. Thanks for jumping on [DATE-2]. And if again, if you guys. has strong partnership with [PERSON-2] here. So if any questions come up, feel free to reach out to me.
Speaker 6: And if we have any references, we'll send them your way.
EndUser: Great. Thanks so much.
Agent: Thank you. Take

006990_167_6qr3y000000sYXCAA2,"Speaker 3: Thank you so much for this, [FAC-1]. Thank you, [ORG-1], for the time.
Speaker 3: I think we'll take a step back while I've had a quick discussion with [PERSON-1] and before the call as to what exactly is it that [ORG-2] is into.
Speaker 3: But more importantly, before jumping on to, I think I understand that from [QUANTITY-1] that lead management is something which we have in mind, probably setting up tasks for ourselves, delegating tasks to us, to us, to us, to organize, keeping a track of what all follow-ups are there in the system.
Speaker 3: All of this is okay, but more importantly, if you can just spare a couple.
Speaker 3: Of moments to understand how [LAW-1] functions as an organization right now because [ORG-3] r limited understanding which I have of the organization we are looking at [ORG-4] which is in to contract Manufacturing for you know .
Speaker 3: Prominent players like could be comes of the world or you know, [PERSON-2] of the world.
Speaker 3: So if you can just help me with the quick brief on that part, then probably we can take it up ahead in terms of detailed requirements and all those things.
Agent: No, you sort of got that right. So we are a contract development and Manufacturing organization. So we're into formulations and genetics. So like the company is going to come to us.
Agent: They're going to ask us to probably do manufactured tablets, capsules or injectables for them. And we do that, a part from that we also offer licensing services.
Agent: Like we have like certain set products of our own that we want to, you know, basically, you know, out license or type of stuff.
Agent: Our partners that this is what we have and if you know this is what you need we can [GPE-1] e and supply this to you.
Agent: So this is basically what we do we basically manufacture tablet s and capsules and injectables and the other organizations or we probably you [PERSON-3] w Yeah, I mean more or less this is what we do or otherwise we out license there are certain things that we also have so there are certain products that we've invested our money in and like we want people to come and buy it from us or come and take it from us so that we can supply it to them.
Agent: So more or less this is it. But yeah, so and get into oral solids and injectables as I told you. So we just want to, with in terms of our current clients and our prospective clients we just needed.
Agent: A system that can help us manage all of that.
Speaker 3: And like, as I said, basically we want to make sure that our lead management and everything is in place. Understood.
Speaker 3: When we talk about this process and just correct me if I'm wrong, some of these questions might sound very vague to
Agent: You, but whatever things which I've understood so far, are we looking at, API formulation creations or salt creations or things like these. So that's the thing. So after API, that's where that's where we come into the picture.
Agent: So we basically get API and like we and then from that we formulate. Right. So to make a tablet or a capsule, you need API.
Speaker 3: And then from there we go and like we are the ones that are going to basically turn that into a tablet or a capsule. Understood. Got it.
Speaker 3: So I think I kind of understand what we are looking at right now because we've been working with customers.
Speaker 3: Like I said, just to name a few of you, we're talking about customers like [ORG-5]'s pharmaceutical, [ORG-6] pharmaceutical, [ORG-7] biosciences. So right, at least from [QUANTITY-2], we understand how, you know, a pharmaceutical organization functions.
Agent: But more importantly, when we talk about these processes, I think lead management is something which we're looking at right now, at least to start things off with more from an individual.
Agent: Yeah, I'm just talking basically just to have everything in one place be it for.
Agent: Me, be it for my other colleagues, just like so that you know we are all just aware o f what we are doing and more than anything else also to our basically our [WORK_OF_ART-1] reporting manage r he also gets to see what we are doing.
Agent: So somewhere, somewhere along those lines, a t the moment this is what are this thing is like something to remind us that we have t o do something and just basically to have everything in one place apart like you know rather tha n it being scattered and everyone reporting separately.
Speaker 3: If someone has to look at what the other perso n is doing you can straight up that, but which I think is the most importan t. How many people are we looking at in the team right now, web, [PERSON-4]?
Agent: A pattern that also just know what we are supposed to do,
Speaker 3: We are about six of us.
Agent: Ok, because you emphasized on the point, I think a couple of times that each of these people should be able to see what the other person is doing at any given point in time.
Agent: But more importantly, Just a cover, like, you know, just so that we get to see what I mean, mostly it's for like personal use and the sense that we get to know what we have to do.
Agent: But also if we need to see, like, you know, sometimes we end up like two people are one person or like, you know, someone's already given out certain information contacting
Speaker 3: And we don't know and we end up sharing the same. So just something with regards to that. So that we all know, we all know that we're at the same page. understood.
Speaker 3: Just help me out with a couple of things on this. When we talk about lead management, I think like [GPE-2] mentioned, website
Agent: Inquiries is one prominent source from where you get these inquiries into play.
Agent: Are we also doing certain outbound activities or inbound is the only thing we are relying upon?
Agent: No, we do contact people ourselves also on both and websites.
Agent: I think it's like just the connections that we've made so far like as I think [PERSON-5] and everyone had mentioned even [PERSON-6] had mentioned that you know we attend certain events and we already have pre-existing clients right so pre-existing clients will also come up come up to us and ask us for more information or like you know they probably want a new product.
Agent: So queries like that as well. Websites aren't the only thing rather actually I feel like the connector we made so far.
Speaker 3: Far is what we drive almost but websites also are a thing but with that being said I can' t say that that's the only thing that's there . understood. I think let me do one thing.
Speaker 3: How about quickly pull up my screen just to give
Agent: You a quick feeder as to how sales was looked like. Have you guys ever been able to look at what sales was, looks like in

EndUser: Oh, okay.
Agent: This is [PERSON-1].
EndUser: All right.
Agent: This is [PERSON-1] with [ORG-1].
Agent: How are you?
EndUser: I'm good.
EndUser: How are you?
Agent: I'm doing well. Thank you. I'm doing well. I am reaching out. I wanted to give you a call. There's been some realignment on the team over here at [ORG-1].
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: And I am actually a part of the team now. So your main point of contact, [PERSON-2], is still with the company and he works mostly with [PERSON-3] and the [ORG-2] and [PERSON-4].
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I don't think you should be speaking with me about this.
Agent: Okay. Sure.
EndUser: I'm not sure if it would be somebody in our IT Salesforce Department.
Agent: Okay. Sure.
EndUser: I just, I use [ORG-1], but I don't have, you know, I've just been shown some different things to do to help out in keeping things current.
Agent: Gotcha.
EndUser: But I don't, you know, I just, you know, they gave me a log in. And, but I don't know anything about how our account is set up or anything like that.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Well, and that's certainly okay. I guess I should get the reason why I called you now specifically is I got passed a note from my Marketing teams and that you joined and or signed up for a demo.
Agent: That we have of our commerce cloud.
EndUser: Oh, I did.
Agent: And it's, okay, so, hey, I just wanna make sure.
EndUser: I did. I did.
Agent: And then really this is kind of a follow up.
Agent: Hey, was that useful?
Agent: Did you find everything that you needed?
Agent: I just, probably frankly, don't even know if that didn't happen yet. I just kinda got a note passing it to, hey.
EndUser: I don't think it has.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: It might be [DATE-1] maybe. I'd have to look at that, but I do remember signing up for that. I just wanted to.
EndUser: You know, I'm going into a lot of screens and kind of figuring out how we use them. And I'm doing trailhead, you know, the training.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But I just, I had a project assigned to me [DATE-2] that I had to use our back office system and [ORG-1] and they, integrate, you know, things go back and forth overnight.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Yeah. Uh huh.
EndUser: And I knew nothing about [ORG-1]. I had never logged in.
EndUser: So I just started, you know, looking around for how do I do this?
EndUser: How do I do that?
EndUser: And then I got the email for the demo, I think, or I found it myself somehow.
Agent: Got you.
EndUser: So I just figured I would watch that and I may have taught myself something incorrectly and I may have missed something that I would find very useful.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Sure.
EndUser: So that's how I came into it. But I don't, my normal everyday job doesn't really involve sales force, although I hope to become much more involved in testing some things in there for us.

EndUser: Hello?
Agent: Can you hear me?
EndUser: Yes, I can now, yes.

EndUser: Okay.
Agent: Into that end, what I'd like to do for you [PERSON-5], if you have like [TIME-1] and or [DATE-1], because I want to, I think we can help.

EndUser: Mm-hmm.
Agent: But like, I quite frankly, I want to do something that digging for you.
Agent: So if you have time [DATE-3], I'd love to set up, you know, minutes, just figure out what the project is that you were assigned and then how I might be able to help take some of the legwork off of your play and get you the information you need faster to get you able to still work with that.
EndUser: Yeah, I don't really feel comfortable signing up for that because I have the feeling that our [ORG-1] team in IT would say that, you know, that's their thing to do.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I think that, you know, that I do want to do the demo, but that's kind of like me finding some kind of thing online and saying, oh, I'll watch this, where this seems like more formal with [ORG-1].
Agent: First, I understand that. Yeah.
Agent: Yep.
Agent: Gotcha. Yeah.
EndUser: I don't really feel comfortable with that.
Agent: And that's I certainly respect that. So at the very least, what I'll do now is I'll most send you my information.
Agent: And after that demo happens, if there's any follow up questions that are needed, or you just want help, I mean, I'm a part of the team that You know, I'm here to help you, you know, in whatever capacity that might be.
EndUser: Well you were either a cross definitely bounded by m AA is it argument [WORK_OF_ART-1] clutches you on the defensive wall but I'm Recording from it so when you see something else, you really can not use the file okay?
Agent: So if you do need help moving forward.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: At least you know who to reach out to and not this giant, you know, 1-895-phone number type of thing.
EndUser: Yes, that's wonderful.
Agent: So. Okay.
EndUser: I would definitely appreciate that. And I can talk to my sales force admins too and see what they think. I just don't want to take that step on my own.
Agent: And that's totally fine. If you find that [ORG-1] is becoming more and more important, you know, in your [DATE-4] job and that you need the information, I think we regrouped in.
EndUser: Okay.
Agent: If not, I'd love to hear what that demo does for you and we'll go from there. So no pressure or worry.
EndUser: All right, perfect.
Agent: All right.
EndUser: Okay, and you said you're kind of a count rep.

Agent: Definitely, definitely gives me a little bit more credibility within the account.
EndUser: Right. Right.
Agent: When that will you been.
EndUser: Right. Although I trusted you from the first second I said hello.
Agent: Oh,

Agent: But I first want to check my team to see if it's in this before. It looks like right now there's just this, just a recap for the team. Hello.
Agent: It looks like there's only like there's like a [ORG-1] inbox app. that I personally haven't seen and that might be blocking something when we're trying to put in the actual integration.

Agent: Thanks, glad to hear it doing pretty well myself here too.
Agent: No one kept me out of a booth [TIME-1], but real quick, the read for my call is, I had a notice on your LinkedIn, you've got quite a bit of [ORG-1] experience.
Agent: And I'm working on the Ardfork events account team here, and there really hasn't been much conversation between [ORG-1] and Ardfork. Just wanted to see if you might have some time [DATE-1] for a quick interlude with recall.

Agent: Okay.
Agent: Any specific types of reporting that you're looking to build that you're not able to currently?

007777_167_6qr3y000000g6wlAAA,"Agent: Hey [PERSON-1], uh, the [DATE-1], Jr.
EndUser: Sorry, it was that mute.
EndUser: How are you?
EndUser: Very good. Good.
Agent: It's a fun day saying [DATE-2] [DATE-3]. So it was all chaos across the only.
EndUser: Good guy. I'm sure. And then [DATE-4] it's, you know, it's just everything's silent.
EndUser: Nice quiet, [PERSON-2]. Exactly. Exactly.
Agent: Things are still happening in the background. I saw [PERSON-3]'s TLS case. Got resolved. It looks like. Yeah. So that I want to check in. If you want that, just make sure many of these go there.
Agent: But, you know, it seems. It's. pretty quiet. I know even at mutual, I think a couple of people are on vacation or out of office right now just that time of year. So yeah, kind of the kind of
EndUser: Our kind of slowest time for my team. So it's been kind of nice.
Agent: You say that, but it sounds like all the other business groups are coming are poking their heads out and saying, hey, what can what can email do for you?
Agent: That's what it feels like at least. I don't know.
Agent: Is that normal?
Agent: Yeah, I mean, there's always a lot of new stuff. I would say things just take a little bit longer to kind of get going.
EndUser: But yeah, lots of new things coming out, but just getting it scheduled and prioritized.
Agent: Yeah, there was, we had a call with [PERSON-4], [PERSON-5], and [PERSON-6] [DATE-5]. I think it was kind of actually on behalf of [ORG-1] 1 [PERSON-7] as it relates to [ORG-2] ads.
Agent: Have you heard about that or not really?
EndUser: Oh, no, but it's something, I mean, I heard a little bit of it because [PERSON-6] had reached out. Yeah.
EndUser: To talk about it, it sounds like it's more of a lead gen effort but I don't really have any more details on that.
EndUser: Is that just, Well, what is that?
EndUser: Is it just connecting like the ads like?
Agent: So how does that work?
Agent: So this is where it gets a little more complicated because I think it's I assume it's your top it's medrivo asking Right, but that's where it's a little bit more complicated because of credentials, but let's say if it wasn't medrivo It was just mutual of a hot internal right and you wanted to connect [ORG-3], let's say, Marketing Cloud to make a more omnichannel with your paid ads, so [ORG-2] ads, right?
Agent: You can do that and throw all the different connectors between [ORG-2] ads and Marketing cloud and your version of intelligence reports advanced plus Sales Cloud connecting in right you can start painting a better picture of some level of attribution of the money and then also retargeting and look-alike audiences back to [ORG-2] Ads or whatever I've had in that works platform, so Pinterest, [ORG-4], all that stuff.
Agent: But the reason why it can work that way is because it's all in-half, close walls of mutual, and
Agent: The other pieces, kind of login credentials. So.
Agent: And where you're hosting those sites, right?
Agent: So you're connecting your [ORG-2] Ads account and you're doing form pills. So it's like, now the question really comes back to Madrivo of
EndUser: Who has the login credentials to those [ORG-2] ad keywords that you want to either bid more, retarget and all that stuff.
EndUser: Because that's a piece, right?
Agent: And then if it's your credentials, great.
Agent: If it's their credentials, how does that work with mutual [ORG-5] piece, right?
Agent: So now it's like. It starts getting a little bit more complicated, just based off of something like that.
Agent: So we're just trying to understand the use case there, talk about future potential use cases so that you set up the system properly at the foundation.
Agent: Because a big thing that customers do is not just, oh, these keywords are bidding well, but then retargeting those app audiences is a big one.
EndUser: And then making that an omnichannel journey of just retargeting it in a different way, too. So.
Agent: Yeah, so it's yeah, there's a lot of different ways to do what they're asking for. It's just It's hard. We don't know exactly what it looks like Just yet to make a stronger information there Hey [PERSON-8]
EndUser: I'm going
EndUser: Hey,
Agent: I think it's might be a light crew for us [DATE-4] [PERSON-9], we just wrecked our [DATE-6] [DATE-3]. So it's kind of quiet at [ORG-6] [DATE-4].
Agent: A lot of systems going on, but for you, [PERSON-8], anything top of mind, things you want me to go chase down on your list there?
EndUser: Nothing for me. I usually leave all those chases to [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-10], I just wanna listen.
Agent: I hear it up.
Agent: Okay, the only other thing on my list, [PERSON-1], is as it relates to [ORG-7] and I think use case, I think you're about three or four with, I think you're working on that with [PERSON-10].
Agent: Yeah, just kind of how is that going. You know, we're at things slowed down a little bit or. I think that I don't know where things are at with that one.
EndUser: I know we had at [DATE-7] something scheduled, but that was canceled and I haven't seen anything since.
EndUser: So I don't know, [PERSON-8], if you know, if she's actively kind of working on that still or where we're at with those additional use cases.
EndUser: They are still in progress, I believe. I can check on our board.
Agent: Because before we know it, I just got a notice internally automated things saying the Data Cloud is going to end, if you will, in [DATE-8].
Agent: Unless we work on a couple things there, but some of mine, and I know some of mine for the team on expanding these cases and capabilities there too.
EndUser: We've got a couple stories. We've got adding new fields for use case three, and then we're working on lead segmentation.
Agent: Oh, that's a big one.
Agent: Ok. Or is that for the advisor group, [PERSON-8]?
Agent: Or is it for others as well?
EndUser: It looks like it is for our [ORG-7] effort. We're not really probably advisor. Yeah, it is advisor marketing. OK, yeah.
Agent: Yeah, that sounds good.
Agent: And then because I think that might also relate to some of the use cases that came out of the workshop, [PERSON-1] around like service and call center, or sending out emails to mitigate, you know, call volume for [DATE-9] or certain scenarios, right, like bills and things like that.
EndUser: Sale center around
Agent: So being able to create a list there for segmentation would be, in my mind would make sense, but I just don't know how that's, set up on on the other architecture to support that.
EndUser: I don't have anything else on my end. I don't think but yeah, or I might [PERSON-8] follow up with [PERSON-10] on that one specific use case.
EndUser: Might be ready to do something pretty soon. I know we're still working on some of the like meds up aging and emails for that we're kind of already set up to go. To go with.
EndUser: I know, [PERSON-8], I don't know if anyone talked to you about it, but I know we did have a little snag with the birthday campaign going out to opt it out. Like people that The advisor opted out.
EndUser: So I don't know if I think [PERSON-12] or [PERSON-12] and [PERSON-11] were going to maybe reach out to [PERSON-12] to see if we could talk to add
EndUser: Briefly, but I don't know if they got that result or not, but Yeah, a couple of them have come up. So I haven't heard anything about that.
EndUser: And then I do know The use case three, the add new fields that's going to be deployed either [TIME-1] or [DATE-10]. Oh, sweet. Okay. So and that's the four new additional fields added to policy stream.
EndUser: And I can put that I can send you that, [PERSON-17], if you want to take a look at it.
EndUser: Awesome.
Agent: All right. Well, um, not too much on my list here. Uh, there's nothing on the also give you back [TIME-2] here.

1. ""So how does that work?"" (referring to the connection between [ORG-2] ads and Marketing Cloud)
2. ""Is that just connecting like the ads like?"" (referring to the use case of connecting [ORG-2] ads to [ORG-3] Marketing Cloud)
3. ""And then if it's your credentials, great. If it's their credentials, how does that work with mutual [ORG-5] piece, right?"" (referring to the issue of login credentials for [ORG-2] ads)"
007607_167_6qr3y000000ogwkAAA,"Agent: For all of us less repeating. So yeah, So
Speaker 2: Go ahead. we're looking for a document reader where it'll read like a PDF, JPEGs, right, scans, stuff like that, that is integrated with [ORG-1] be able to translate certain fields opportunity.
Agent: To
Agent: Into the So
Speaker 2: For example, if I upload an application, right?
Speaker 2: That we receive as a PDF, that application will autofill the contact information, etc, etc.
Agent: In
Speaker 2: Salesforce opportunities. So I found on [ORG-1] that there's like this intelligent document reader thing that's available through [ORG-1]. You guys work with [ORG-2] or something with it.
Speaker 2: And I was kind of looking into it and I was like, there's licensing that you would need and like, how that works, what that looks like, right?
Speaker 2: Because the biggest thing is, is that we are uploading these documents into our, you know, into [ORG-1] that we want translated into [ORG-1].
Speaker 2: So there's not too many options seems to be like a lot of integrations where it takes [ORG-1] information and turns them into a document.
Agent: That can do that. It
Speaker 2: Yeah. But not vice versa. Like a dog. It's not basically like generating that generate whatever. It's working just to kind of extract data from it. Just kind of on [DATE-1] use of applications coming in and.
Speaker 2: You know, if we get, you know, let's say. like a driver's license. I'm not, you know, off the top. I'm like, yeah, I was going to ask.
Speaker 2: I think one of the big questions that they would probably have is like, I know you mentioned like application, but like how many different sort of, I mean, like driver's license, I think for sure, it already does potentially like passport, although I don't know if that's relevant to you guys, but like, How many different applications do you guys have, like templates because
Agent: I'm sure you have to train the system where to look for which fields.
Agent: And so if it's just like, hey, we've got one application and then to do like a driver's license with that, I feel like that would be pretty easy.
Agent: On the other hand, if you guys have like 24 different applications for 23 different products or types of loans or whatever that looks like, that I of hands pretty quickly.
Speaker 2: Feel like could get out So yeah, it's... Pretty simple.
Speaker 2: I think it'll be like account information, right?
Speaker 2: From like maybe a bank letter or a avoided check. Application are pretty So it's all the same information.
Agent: Standard.
Speaker 2: There might be like different paper applications. So if it's like a vendor that we work with, the application is different, but the fields are the same.
Agent: That they have Yeah.
Speaker 2: So it's not like it's going to be searching a different for field.
Agent: Yeah. And so the structure of the application document is the same, like on
Speaker 2: Each one, like it's in the same spot, basically, throughout. I was going to say the placement of the might be in different spots.
Agent: Information
Speaker 2: But it's not like it's going to, you know, one's asking for.
Speaker 2: Social you know but they're saying you know what's your personal identification number or something you know where it's a different lingo it'll still be like a social Security number field it just might be in a different
Agent: Spot on the document yeah Well, I didn't want to say because I'm pretty sure the way that that initial document and the reason why the number of templates is so important is like it's look based on the position in the document as like it doesn't.
Speaker 2: Sort of trained to
Agent: Freshly scan every single document and then see social [ORG-3] and then tracks the immediate next you know seven eight digits regardless of where it is on the page.
Agent: I think how the document scanner is reading is it's like hey we know this is an application template because it's an application template we can expect the first line this is the field the first line is going to the second line
Speaker 2: You know, you got to get advice for us. So, okay.
Agent: Majority of them are going to be in one template. Okay.
Agent: So I just know that we also have some one-off ones and maybe like, there's maybe like four or five ones that we get a lot of over the rest of like the one-offs that we could obviously manual.
Agent: Again, majority of our application flow is like online, which automatically will create itself into an opportunity.
Speaker 2: Right. But we do have a handful of manual ones that gets sent in. So. And just to get like an idea of like, um, like how many you guys are receiving, like on a [DATE-2] basis.
Speaker 2: Um, what would you say if you had to guess?
Speaker 2: I want to say,
Speaker 2: I don't want to go off of [DATE-3].
Agent: It hasn't been I still want
Speaker 2: Necessary the hottest. to say it's fine. I want to say where at least looking at 5 to 673.
Speaker 2: Right. And that's, that's including everything. I think I don't know the ratio as far as manual versus not just because I don't process them manually.
Agent: The sales reps will do that individually. Yeah. But as a company yeah, we're looking at that.
Speaker 2: Overall,
Agent: Is that total, is that per month or per it's per month.
Speaker [DATE-4]?
Speaker 2: So
Agent: So. Gotcha. I mean, hey, that's a pretty decent number. So I was going to say if it was 684 a day, I think that the business case for something like [ORG-4] would be very strong.
Agent: Seven or 909 a month though. I mean, still pretty. That's still a pretty good business case. Obviously, if you came back and you told me how I would be like, well, I would recommend that you keep it manual.
Speaker 2: We're getting like three a day,
Agent: But no, I mean, that makes sense. So let's see. All right, so here's what [PERSON-1], I had already had some initial conversations, just internally technical theme, just to confirm like what we can and can't do.
Agent: Based on what you've told me, I think we can probably do this, but I wanted to just go back, Make sure that [PERSON-2] is a clear understanding. Let me go meet with my guy, see what he says.
Agent: And then I think the next steps for us would be me coming back to you with some more information on functionality, what specifically this would look like if you guys were doing it within sales force, obviously the cost it would take any sort of set up other considerations that may go into it and then hope is there anything else outside of those pieces that you feel like I missed or you would want to include in that follow up.
Agent: Um, No, I think that's pretty much what we're
Speaker 2: As it stands right now, what we're looking into. I'll go back to our team as well and be like, Hey, this is what we're looking into.
Speaker 2: And, you know, do you, is there any more like asks in the same realm, right?
Speaker 2: This is what it is. Are there specific use cases or something that's like a must or, you know, want to see if that's also available and then I can shoot that stuff over to you.
Agent: Hopefully prior to prior to the next meeting. Okay. Well, hey, sounds like a plan.
Speaker 2: Well, [PERSON-1], anything else that I missed in
Agent: This homework I've got for. for you . Nope, that's about it. Okay, cool. Yeah, well, hey, appreciate your time. Allow me a little bit, allow me a day or so.
Agent: Should be able to get you this information And then we can determine
Speaker 2: Back, I'd say, probably [DATE-5] [TIME-1]. where we need to go from here.","Were there any moments of confusion or misunderstanding during the call, and how were they clarified?","There were a few moments of confusion or misunderstanding during the call.

005634_167_6qr3y000000sZmfAAE,"Agent: Yes, that How do you know?
EndUser: Sounds great actually. Yeah. So, basically what I want, there is only one module we are looking at right now that is the please module.
EndUser: So, the parents pay fees and it you know it's done through the portal of smart school.
EndUser: What happens is whatever fees are paid, then that fee detail is pulled up from [ORG-1] into their system so that it automatically, what you say, let us know who all have paid fees and who all are remaining fees.
EndUser: Because as I said, [ORG-1] is kind of a tally software which one must constitute use.
EndUser: In that regard, in [GPE-1], everything will be possible for them to integrate and put it in.
Speaker 4: It is possible. Yeah, it is possible. Wow. That he was father, or the son, [ORG-2], because I don't know.
EndUser: I'm sorry, this is just IT. Father is director.
Speaker 4: Yeah, okay. Yeah, it is possible sir. Already as we are using for smart school law, same thing we are going to follow, but for them, we are providing a web service like for both software to link.
EndUser: Same thing,
EndUser: But
Speaker 4: I don't know whether they need a API. So, API also be providing for the another one software. And also if we need, if we need what are the things needed, it is not a problem.
EndUser: We can supply. No, Okay.
EndUser: Is there anything specific that [PERSON-1] you will need that you can specify?
EndUser: Because I
EndUser: Don't know. So basically, I think if they are able to give us the endpoints, rest API and the authentication, I don't think there's anything else. I think, [GPE-1], you understand how the integrations work.
EndUser: So those are technical details which will figure out. But you are confident that is possible.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I think we are providing for two sub-towards. I'll let you be here. They are different, the two sub-towards. I'll let you be arguing.
EndUser: The same thing we are
Speaker 4: Going to give. And also, you should follow some other things. Because how we are doing is, so first we are out.
Speaker 4: To say from [ORG-3] said we have a masters and masters, masters in the sense projects a s well as shall I connect my system then I briefly will explain so these are the things goin g to be done .
EndUser: Yes, I like my system.
Speaker 4: I will share.
Speaker 4: So this is ACME RP sub-tuber, it is in Windows applications. So already they are using, even in the [ORG-4]-BER province also, they are using ACME RP sub-tuber.
Speaker 4: From that only, instead of entering for fee collections, is, they have to get the transaction from the fee application.
EndUser: What they are doing
Speaker 4: Because since that is another software is available, they are already fee.
EndUser: For a fee collecting
Speaker 4: No, whether you have or not, whether you are using.
EndUser: You are asking me. I thought you were telling me.
Speaker 4: No, no, no. Just I'm asking whether you are using another supplement for collecting free out the world.
Speaker 4: What school you are not using now?
Speaker 4: Now you are going
EndUser: To somewhere somewhere. For [DATE-1], we were using [ORG-5].
Speaker 4: Yeah, OK. But [DATE-2].
EndUser: [DATE-3], we are looking at potential of, you know, salesforce maybe and seeing it.
Speaker 4: So you are agree upon that.
EndUser: No, it's still in the talks.
Speaker 4: Yeah, okay. So, just I'm telling the process how we are integrating.
EndUser: So, this is...
Agent: [PERSON-2], sorry, just took what you have a meeting at [TIME-1]. So, I think these are very... technicalities that we can get into later point of time.
Speaker 4: Like again, [TIME-2] only, just about two two three minutes, I will explain and just brief, that's all. So this is a project. This is a larger.
Speaker 4: So already they are using it and also they are entering the transactions, other things. But instead of a fee collection, so they don't, they no need to enter here.
Speaker 4: Rather, they have to get the transaction from the sub any problem or we can to one further.
EndUser: Is there see later ?
EndUser: No, 0.0 is this state.

Speaker 4: This is, we can do it later also. These are the things we are going to do.
EndUser: Just explain So, freedom mine, whole point first.
Speaker 4: That. Yeah.
EndUser: I can't move ahead. which you know, if this is not the same, see, this is the same, this is the same, we will be able to provide us not the same.
Agent: The API, we can write that, that is
EndUser: If you can like shorten that to me, that is okay.
Agent: Yeah, that's assured.
Agent: So once he confirmed, right?
Agent: Like we will be able to provide us the [ORG-6] once we have the [ORG-6], then whatever data points you mentioned, we can pick it up. That's not
EndUser: A concern. Okay.
Speaker 4: And also we will give the format. We are what are the Yes.

004754_167_6qr3y000000ochYAAQ,"Speaker 2: Yeah.
Agent: Thanks.
Speaker 2: I guess, um,
Agent: I guess, do you have any up though?
Agent: I guess I want to ask you, I guess with the Marketing Cloud now going and the Data Cloud going to was meant to go to [PERSON-1] [DATE-1].
Agent: Have you got an update on any of that?
Speaker 2: I got. Yeah. So yes, I have an update. We just had a session with friend, her availability is limited.
Speaker 2: At the moment, because she had it off to [GPE-1], but we just came from [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] and the team.
Speaker 2: So that was just sent through literally like [TIME-1] before this meeting sent through a slide deck that has all the details around the proposal, which will be going up, I think it's got to go, not just [PERSON-4], it's got to go to [PERSON-5] and then to prove for the approval because the op-expend I think sits in our budget in [ORG-1].
Speaker 2: So we've got a summary slide to do to add to the deck from a strategic perspective in terms of well.
Agent: Just
Speaker 2: The reason for the uplift in the cost is because we're uplifting the volume of comms we're sending to customers to improve the experience.
Speaker 2: We think that'll have benefits in relation to like [ORG-2] and incentive scheme but we also in addition think like not only is it the right thing to do but the more proactive comms we send to customers the less they should be calling us and the less we'll have to service those inbound calls.
Speaker 2: So There's just that strategic piece to overlay to justify the uplift. Sure. But yeah, once that's done, then I think I think we're good to go.
Agent: So that's got to go. So because I got told, [PERSON-6]'s mentioned to [PERSON-7], they had a conversation that it was going to go to [PERSON-4] [DATE-1] in [PERSON-8] [DATE-2].
Agent: So that's so it's now just going straight to [PERSON-4] and then up to [PERSON-5] proof.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yep.
Agent: So [PERSON-8] doesn't need to say it. That's good.
Speaker 2: [PERSON-4]'s fine with it though. They said [PERSON-4]'s all fine with it in relation side of the budget.
Agent: To the other Yeah,
Speaker 2: It's because the like the actual spend is split across multiple budgets. So that's why. Okay, so he's approved it for them.
Agent: When's it going?
Agent: When do you think that will go to [PERSON-5] through?
Agent: Um, Okay, because yeah, this is all like our costs and dual desk is all on signing.
Speaker 2: Probably [DATE-3].
Agent: Hi [DATE-4]. Right. Okay.
Agent: So I don't know, does [PERSON-2] told them that?
Speaker 2: Sorry.
Agent: Signing by, [PERSON-2] told them that's valid for [DATE-5] 13th, [DATE-6] the 13th, sorry.
Agent: [DATE-6] the 13th?
Agent: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure. I mean, it depends on people's availability. I haven't been across the conversations until just literally [DATE-2].
Agent: Yeah, that's all I've
Speaker 2: Asked you. Oh, sorry.
Agent: No, I was just saying, yeah, [PERSON-2] should be all over it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [PERSON-9]'s all over it. So she's the one who presented like the information, the summary to she said, [PERSON-10] is fine with his portion.
Agent: Us. She said,
Speaker 2: It's just this, yeah. So like, it's so frustrating the way that the budgeting process works around here. Finance, anyway, I'm not gonna get into details because you know how frustrating it is.
Speaker 2: But the spend across the whole deal that you put together is split across about, I don't know, it's like three different budgets, right?
Speaker 2: Because there's a digital services, there's a support contract with [ORG-3], there's the op-expend for the messages themselves, and then there's the op-expend for the licensing.
Speaker 2: So it's two EGMs, so it's [PERSON-9] and [PERSON-5], but it's also two different GMs as well. So that's why it's so difficult to kind of, to get it done. Sorry, not difficult, just time consuming.
Agent: Time consuming, Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I'll call for all these people.
Agent: Well, thank you, love.
Speaker 2: [PERSON-13] crossed. Well, it.

Agent: Night. Yeah.
Agent: Provided
Speaker 2: So yeah, I'm kind of getting excited. I'm just waiting for that final confirmation on the code freeze. And I'll just wait to catch up on sleep until [DATE-8].
Agent: Yeah, well, I'll call you [DATE-9], love and check in on you So what do you work in the top?
Speaker 2: Before.
Agent: I think we're just, I've just taken [DATE-10] in between off.

EndUser: Which will find out?

EndUser: Where?
EndUser: What office?
Agent: At
EndUser: What office are you looking at?
Agent: The address that we had,
EndUser: There's 209 South Mill Street in [GPE-1]. There's one office and then there's 3091. [GPE-2].
Agent: Yeah. The 2974 West Union Hills.
EndUser: [TIME-1]?
Agent: Yes, sir.

006924_167_6qr3y000000ohhdAAA,"Agent: Okay. So going back. I told you now that's true.
Speaker 2: And not when you were done.
Agent: Yeah, So going back to the beginning then and so what we calculated these ROI metrics on are the three [ORG-1]'s of referral conversion, increasing the amount of referrals you're getting, increasing and boosting agent productivity, and then finally immunotherapy adherence or reducing the amount of drop off that you're getting for patient.
Agent: So what we started with is you have 37,000 referrals per year with a conversion rate of [PERCENT-1]. That nets out to about 5,474 referrals out of that 37,000.
Agent: Our conservative projected improvements based off the numbers that you gave us and then documenting everything in [ORG-2] will give you [PERCENT-2] increase in new conversions, which gives you 21.049253886901217 conversion rate.
Agent: Because again, eight or sorry, [PERCENT-2] of 13 is point eight. So we added that together quantifying that that's about 37 new referrals per year.
Agent: So each referral on average is $[MONEY-1] per patient based off of the metrics that we received from your you and your team. That's an increase of $[MONEY-2] per year, but that's top line revenue prior to EBITDA.
Agent: You mentioned an increase of $[MONEY-2] of top line revenue when we margin that down the value of this conversion rate is actually 174,000 times [PERCENT-3] or $[MONEY-3]. And a steady state margin adjusted improvement.
Agent: So again, not a ton here for impact wise, but it's just the beginning and it's going to compound based off of the other KPIs that we're going to be presenting. For agent productivity, this is the call center.
Agent: Your agents are managing about 826 referrals per year out of those 34 agents that you have [DATE-1].
Agent: If we project [PERCENT-4] increase in scheduling and increase referrals, we calculate [PERCENT-5] conversion per agent and adding 58 additional referrals per year, which are then going back to that $[MONEY-3] metric.
Agent: That's where that revenue is going to come from.
Agent: And what you're seeing again is just conservative numbers. Since we don't know what your EBITDA margin is [DATE-1], we just did [PERCENT-3] amount, just again, a conservative number.
Agent: And the increase or the impact of margins through this is [MONEY-4] on [DATE-2]. And that'll compound to 57,000 [DATE-3] and then 87,000 for [DATE-4]. Again, not a ton of revenue off the bat.
Speaker 2: But again, those
Agent: Are just the two KPIs. The third KPI, which is the immunotherapy adherence, is where it gets more interesting.
Agent: Any questions on that so far?
Agent: No, I'm good. OK, great. Let me just adjust this so you can see everything. There we go. So the amount of immunotherapy journeys that you gave us is 47,000.
Agent: And so percentage of adherent care plans or the percentage of patients that actually go through the entire. Their entire process with you is [PERCENT-6].
Agent: So [PERCENT-7] of 47,000, I'm sorry, [PERCENT-8] of 47,000 is 21,000 plans or patients that drop off for whatever reason.
Speaker 2: Hair
Agent: So you're not recouping that entire $[MONEY-1] per patient.
Agent: And so our conservative estimate is that we're going to help you document where patients are in [ORG-2], understand where they are in their journey, understand who's showing up to appointments, who is not.
Agent: Flagging that to you so that your agents can then proactively reach out to get them back onto those adhered care plans without doing all that manual work.
Agent: So whether it's like using your current tech stack to send automated text messages or flagging people internally just saying, hey, reach out to [PERSON-1], who is a patient of yours who didn't show up to their recently, making sure they get back on so that they could continue to go through the journey.
Agent: So through that, what we projected is that we're going to increase the amount of patients that are adherent or at least spending more time at minimum before additional months on each adherence or each immunotherapy journey.
Agent: So again, average care plan per year take four of those months out of the 3,515, that's [MONEY-5]362 per patient, so to speak, off.
Speaker 2: Is 3,515. If we
Speaker 2: For the ones that are falling
Agent: The additional revenue from that, I mean, the numbers are kind of crazy there, but it's about 26 million.
Agent: And the actual benefit realization rate, meaning like, you know, those are the numbers, but realistically, what are you going to see?
Agent: It's probably going to drop [PERCENT-9] so the realized incremental revenue is about 9 million with the gross adjusted But then with the EBITDA margin, you're actually looking at $[MONEY-6] of recouped revenue from those patients that fell off.
Speaker 2: Incremental revenue.
Agent: And that's just in [DATE-2]. So in [DATE-2], $[MONEY-6], [DATE-5], a million, and then [DATE-4], 1.0. And so if you take all those numbers, we put it into this benefit summary here.
Agent: We add it all together. [DATE-6], you're going to recoup [MONEY-7], which if you calculate that, I think the total amount that we gave you with torrent and [ORG-2] costs, close to like $[MONEY-8] ish.
Speaker 2: I think it's probably
Agent: Due to my math, I mean by [DATE-7], you're going to recoup your cost already.
Agent: Okay. And go ahead. I'm sorry, in [PERSON-2], who put all these numbers together with the metrics we gave you has more data to basically back this up and can be and
Speaker 2: Can present this to [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4] as well. Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, this is great. I mean, this definitely the dogs much Yeah.
Agent: [PERSON-5] out better.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sorry. What I'm
Agent: Hoping to do during. Sorry, hoping to do when we present, like you mentioned, the feedback you gave it. It's like, all right, these are the three problems we identified. And those are those KPIs.
Agent: So the operating margin of <inaudible> productivity, just by documenting everything and then using automation. These are the different areas that we're going to improve.
Speaker 2: And then here are the numbers that are going to relate to what those problems are solving. Right. I mean, I can definitely pass. I mean, I know I can definitely discuss this with them.
Speaker 2: And then I'll just let you know what, how they want to move forward.
Agent: If there's enough of a tease from here. Yeah, I mean, ideally, like if we could present to this sometime [DATE-8], it could be like [TIME-1] call.
Agent: I, and it'll just be me and [PERSON-2], because I know [PERSON-6] is a little too salesy.
Speaker 2: I'm happy to do that. I can see if I can get [PERSON-2] on a call [DATE-8] with them.
Agent: Yeah, I'm gone all next
Speaker [DATE-9] on PTO. I'll be in the keys. Okay, very nice. Yeah, so and then [DATE-10] I'm back and then we're all in [GPE-1], including the CEO for big meeting.

EndUser: So right now with this talk, we pretty much have everything manually. We make the changes manually, we promote to production manually and all that.
EndUser: So we want to eliminate that process, We want to streamline our development and CI CD process so that it's same across the board.
EndUser: Because right now on our application development side, the non-EDI application development, we have pretty much everything automated through [ORG-1] pipeline, CI CD. And we want to make sure that we are consistent across the board.

Agent: Um, requirement that is for you, but like that is, that's a big requirement for a lot of our customers.
EndUser: Much of a
Agent: Um,
EndUser: Yeah. So that, that's, that's like I said, like that's one of our major concern when we are evaluating this new [ORG-2] system for us at least there is support for that.
Agent: To make sure that
EndUser: And we can have everything in one place and stuff. Having. two separate solutions for . EDI and non-EDI stuff.
Agent: And I imagine that's part of sort of the internal, I wouldn't struggle as the wrong word, but the internal conversation, right?

EndUser: That is correct.
Agent: And that sort of wouldn't be all in the same pane of glass. So I think I can tell that's kind of where the internal struggle is. You guys are probably like, hey, [PERSON-2] would be great for this.
Agent: And [PERSON-1] is very concerned about the migration. And that's actually why we brought the [ORG-3] team and [PERSON-3] back onto the call, because we want to go over a customer story. of sort of migration.

Agent: Is it like an internal system or do you guys have a vendor you use?
Speaker 2: We have a vendor we're using.
Agent: Ok, which one are you know, do you mind if I ask which one?
Agent: We actually work with other technology platforms. Oh,
Speaker 2: Yeah. We're. We're currently using [ORG-1] legacy.
Agent: Yeah, yeah. OK, yeah, it's a big Marketing tool and all that.

Agent: You these very transparent, you know, if you love it, hate it, it won't hurt me.
Speaker 2: Like, the company that I worked with that used [ORG-2] was very entrenched in [ORG-2].
Speaker 2: All of our communications were [ORG-3] in, including our phone systems and everything, right?
Speaker 2: So all of our quoting was done through a [ORG-2] platform at discounting and everything.

Agent: So it sounds like you kind of had the bonsarati of [ORG-2] like, you said the bells and whistles like everything was centralized.

Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, and I worked for another company that used a dialed back version of [ORG-2] just for more like generic [PRODUCT-1] tracking and lead tracking and things like that. And I didn't really have any issues with that either.
Speaker 2: You know, it's just. There's a lot of things that can be implemented into [ORG-2] like item level detail pricing level detail and all that kind of stuff. We don't really operate in that kind of a fashion.

006924_167_6qr3y000000ohhcAAA,"Agent: Okay. So going back. I told you now that's true.
Speaker 2: And not when you were done.
Agent: Yeah, So going back to the beginning then and so what we calculated these ROI metrics on are the three [ORG-1]'s of referral conversion, increasing the amount of referrals you're getting, increasing and boosting agent productivity, and then finally immunotherapy adherence or reducing the amount of drop off that you're getting for patient.
Agent: So what we started with is you have 34,000 referrals per year with a conversion rate of [PERCENT-1]. That nets out to about 5,500 referrals out of that 34,000.
Agent: Our conservative projected improvements based off the numbers that you gave us and then documenting everything in [ORG-2] will give you [PERCENT-2] increase in new conversions, which gives you 17.688466783174074 conversion rate.
Agent: Because again, eight or sorry, [PERCENT-2] of 14 is point eight. So we added that together quantifying that that's about 34 new referrals per year.
Agent: So each referral on average is $[MONEY-1] per patient based off of the metrics that we received from your you and your team. That's an increase of $[MONEY-2] per year, but that's top line revenue prior to EBITDA.
Agent: You mentioned an increase of $[MONEY-2] of top line revenue when we margin that down the value of this conversion rate is actually 136,000 times [PERCENT-3] or $[MONEY-3]. And a steady state margin adjusted improvement.
Agent: So again, not a ton here for impact wise, but it's just the beginning and it's going to compound based off of the other KPIs that we're going to be presenting. For agent productivity, this is the call center.
Agent: Your agents are managing about 753 referrals per year out of those 25 agents that you have [DATE-1].
Agent: If we project [PERCENT-4] increase in scheduling and increase referrals, we calculate [PERCENT-5] conversion per agent and adding 83 additional referrals per year, which are then going back to that $[MONEY-3] metric.
Agent: That's where that revenue is going to come from.
Agent: And what you're seeing again is just conservative numbers. Since we don't know what your EBITDA margin is [DATE-1], we just did [PERCENT-3] amount, just again, a conservative number.
Agent: And the increase or the impact of margins through this is [MONEY-4] on [DATE-2]. And that'll compound to 75,000 [DATE-3] and then 73,000 for [DATE-4]. Again, not a ton of revenue off the bat.
Speaker 2: But again, those
Agent: Are just the two KPIs. The third KPI, which is the immunotherapy adherence, is where it gets more interesting.
Agent: Any questions on that so far?
Agent: No, I'm good. OK, great. Let me just adjust this so you can see everything. There we go. So the amount of immunotherapy journeys that you gave us is 40,000.
Agent: And so percentage of adherent care plans or the percentage of patients that actually go through the entire. Their entire process with you is [PERCENT-6].
Agent: So [PERCENT-7] of 40,000, I'm sorry, [PERCENT-8] of 40,000 is 19,000 plans or patients that drop off for whatever reason.
Speaker 2: Hair
Agent: So you're not recouping that entire $[MONEY-1] per patient.
Agent: And so our conservative estimate is that we're going to help you document where patients are in [ORG-2], understand where they are in their journey, understand who's showing up to appointments, who is not.
Agent: Flagging that to you so that your agents can then proactively reach out to get them back onto those adhered care plans without doing all that manual work.
Agent: So whether it's like using your current tech stack to send automated text messages or flagging people internally just saying, hey, reach out to [PERSON-1], who is a patient of yours who didn't show up to their recently, making sure they get back on so that they could continue to go through the journey.
Agent: So through that, what we projected is that we're going to increase the amount of patients that are adherent or at least spending more time at minimum before additional months on each adherence or each immunotherapy journey.
Agent: So again, average care plan per year take four of those months out of the 3,507, that's [MONEY-5]305 per patient, so to speak, off.
Speaker 2: Is 3,507. If we
Speaker 2: For the ones that are falling
Agent: The additional revenue from that, I mean, the numbers are kind of crazy there, but it's about 21 million.
Agent: And the actual benefit realization rate, meaning like, you know, those are the numbers, but realistically, what are you going to see?
Agent: It's probably going to drop [PERCENT-9] so the realized incremental revenue is about 13 million with the gross adjusted But then with the EBITDA margin, you're actually looking at $[MONEY-6] of recouped revenue from those patients that fell off.
Speaker 2: Incremental revenue.
Agent: And that's just in [DATE-2]. So in [DATE-2], $[MONEY-6], [DATE-5], a million, and then [DATE-4], 1.0. And so if you take all those numbers, we put it into this benefit summary here.
Agent: We add it all together. [DATE-6], you're going to recoup [MONEY-7], which if you calculate that, I think the total amount that we gave you with torrent and [ORG-2] costs, close to like $[MONEY-8] ish.
Speaker 2: I think it's probably
Agent: Due to my math, I mean by [DATE-7], you're going to recoup your cost already.
Agent: Okay. And go ahead. I'm sorry, in [PERSON-2], who put all these numbers together with the metrics we gave you has more data to basically back this up and can be and
Speaker 2: Can present this to [PERSON-3] and [PERSON-4] as well. Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, this is great. I mean, this definitely the dogs much Yeah.
Agent: [PERSON-5] out better.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sorry. What I'm
Agent: Hoping to do during. Sorry, hoping to do when we present, like you mentioned, the feedback you gave it. It's like, all right, these are the three problems we identified. And those are those KPIs.
Agent: So the operating margin of <inaudible> productivity, just by documenting everything and then using automation. These are the different areas that we're going to improve.
Speaker 2: And then here are the numbers that are going to relate to what those problems are solving. Right. I mean, I can definitely pass. I mean, I know I can definitely discuss this with them.
Speaker 2: And then I'll just let you know what, how they want to move forward.
Agent: If there's enough of a tease from here. Yeah, I mean, ideally, like if we could present to this sometime [DATE-8], it could be like [TIME-1] call.
Agent: I, and it'll just be me and [PERSON-2], because I know [PERSON-6] is a little too salesy.
Speaker 2: I'm happy to do that. I can see if I can get [PERSON-2] on a call [DATE-8] with them.
Agent: Yeah, I'm gone all next
Speaker [DATE-9] on PTO. I'll be in the keys. Okay, very nice. Yeah, so and then [DATE-10] I'm back and then we're all in [GPE-1], including the CEO for big meeting.

EndUser: And so I have a bunch of answers from the [ORG-5] team about general health cloud. But I have a feeling that the pub sector cloud is potentially a little bit different.
EndUser: And if it's hosted on a different environment, I don't even remember where I think it might be. And so, yeah, I need to talk to the core [ORG-6], find out, tell them about it.
Agent: Mm-hmm. Sure.
EndUser: And yeah, I mean, it's we're going to want to co-respond to this RFP.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And yeah, that's
Agent: Okay, beautiful. Thank you for providing me with that information.
Agent: And just at a curiosity, do you happen to know the scope of this project or how many users might be using this potential system?
EndUser: Where it is. Yeah, they had an information session [DATE-1], and that question came up and they said they would get back to us in [DATE-5].
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I don't know. But if you think about a city giving out grants and each grant could be multiple people logging in, it's not going to be a particularly small number.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: It could be, and they were talking about approvers and multiple approvers.
EndUser: So internal users are going to be, you know, you know, I, you know, we don't know we were going to get some answers to that, but it's not going to be particularly small, I would say.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Being a government contract, an RP, and there was probably, I don't know, I want to say, 14 people bidding on this on the call.
Agent: Yep.
EndUser: So we have to keep our sharpened our pencils, right, to get the steel done. And we're an <inaudible> Implementation partner, so while I'm here in [GPE-3], I'm just outside of [GPE-4].
Agent: Right.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: These guys, my team is on [GPE-5], so we have very cost effective pricing on that side.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yep.
Agent: Okay, that's good to know. There is a couple of different individuals that I think would be appropriate to connect you to.
Agent: That RFP that you're talking about, is it published already or is there any way that you'd be able to send that to us?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yep. If you email me, I can give you the link to the page and so on. Yeah.
Agent: Okay. If you wouldn't mind, I think that would be the best next step.
Agent: And then from there, I can either connect you with one of our [ORG-7] AEs or our field AEs on my side, but I can do that.
EndUser: Yeah, what's the cutoff used to be 193 when I was there?
EndUser: I think it's more like 239 now, but it could be different for a projector.
Agent: Yeah, it's [MONEY-1]. Okay. Right. Okay.
EndUser: So that's like 158 [NORP-1] and yeah, I'm going to say [ORG-7]. That's my guess.
EndUser: It's going to, first of all, when the deal we have to come in on our 117 is, it's kind of where my head is, but we don't know the numbers, right?
EndUser: They could come back with, you know, some insane number in which case we need to get really creative on how we're going to do this.
Agent: Okay, well, I appreciate you giving me a call back [DATE-1], [PERSON-6]. What I'm going to do is all forward that [ORG-4] over to my [ORG-7] on the public sector team.
Agent: I'll also, and I see the here that you wrote some pretty significant notes, which I'll pass along to him as well.
Agent: And then we can set some time up in the calendar to chat about how we'd like to approach things.
EndUser: Yeah.
EndUser: Absolutely.
EndUser: Just have a curiosity, who's the field AE and who's the field AE RVP?
EndUser: Because I know a lot of people. Okay.
Agent: So right now, it's [PERSON-7]. He sits and his ECSAE, his name's [PERSON-8].
EndUser: And do we know what the RVP the boss, like what his boss's name is?
Agent: Yeah, his name's [PERSON-9].
EndUser: I don't know these people. That's right.
Agent: That's okay.
EndUser: I guess that [DATE-6] in the [GPE-4] office, I know a lot of people, but anyways. Yeah. All right. So I'll apply to your email with the link to the [ORG-4] that we're responding to.
EndUser: And, you know, get some time to get ahead of it.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Oh, I'm so it looks like other look at this 201
EndUser: Either at like 218 to 220 [DATE-7], does it [DATE-8] or possibly [TIME-1] Wednesday, 10 [DATE-9] on [DATE-10].
Agent: To [TIME-2] [DATE-8] [DATE-10]. Okay.
Agent: Okay, beautiful. I appreciate you giving me that. If you wouldn't mind.
EndUser: Oh, the other note is the whole RP is due, I think, on [DATE-11], so like [DATE-14], we can have to move our <inaudible>.
Agent: I'm.
Agent: Okay. Okay, I'll make a note of that on my end.
Agent: If you wouldn't mind, I just have a bit of homework to do to pair you with the right individual, but I'll send you an email so that you could forward meet the [ORG-4] and then I will respond to you know [TIME-3] morning about what the best next step will be.
EndUser: Yeah, no worries, just pass along, get in touch with the right [ORG-8]. I think ACS is the right person at this point.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: And if it, you know, if it looks like it's going to scale up beyond the pass, it's going to work on it.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: But we really need to try and keep it. I'm guessing that the competitive bit like this, we need to keep it at or [DATE-14] [NORP-2]
Agent: Okay. Okay. Amazing. Well, I appreciate the call back [PERSON-3]. And like I said, you can expect that email from me shortly.
EndUser: No problem.
EndUser: Can you please make sure that we tech focus are tagged as the referring partner on the view as well?
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So when the information comes into me, it follows a completely different process. But once we get some time set up in the calendar, then I will follow through with the remainder of the referral exception.

Agent: Kind of what's working well for you and talk through any areas of improvement. If you have a moment first off just curious if you are on [ORG-1] currently.
Agent: And we'll have to hear a little bit about how it's going if you are.
Speaker 2: I know I am not. As far as I know I'm not. I'm just, I use the leader's group, I use the leader's group website that everybody has access to, I guess.
Agent: Okay.
Speaker 2: If
Agent: Got it. Okay. Thank you for clarifying. So yeah, [ORG-1] would be a CRM system. I'm not sure if you're familiar with our platform with the [PRODUCT-1] where you track deals, track customer interactions, store contact information.
Speaker 2: You move forward then I'll show you more. I used it with a previous digler, so yeah, I know a little bit about it, but it was just as an end-user as the only experience I've had.
Agent: Got it. OK, no, that makes sense. And that's kind of exactly the type of person that we're looking to speak to. And I guess that you're not on it now.

EndUser: That's why I was thinking that those patients missing appointments, it's not really how we work. So, but the main problem is the [ORG-1] sort of live on their own island within the state.
EndUser: So any sort of more formalized sort of across the board, we've even looked at delegated credentialing.
EndUser: Anything you do, you always run into the [ORG-1] and not being able to get around having to do the [ORG-1] application in way [DATE-1] that a [ORG-1] application typically takes.
EndUser: So any solution that you guys could brainstorm or help us with, that would be great. That would be great.

Agent: That being said, I do know that we partner with just not of any of my account. So I would just have to do some homework there, but absolutely I can look into that for you.
Agent: So on average, are you saying that the hiccup is [DATE-2]?
EndUser: No. Like, almost we're in 20 different states and so it varies by state. I would say, [DATE-2] would be good. days would be like one of our good states.

EndUser: A state like [GPE-1] is closer to that date that you mentioned [DATE-3] in [GPE-1] in [GPE-2]. I mean, but then the problem we run into is the [ORG-1] administrator.

EndUser: So the family either has to take [DATE-6] off work and drive out or we could see them when we're there.

007784_167_6qr3y000000sYmoAAE,"Agent: Perfect.
Speaker 4: Before we... Oh, go ahead.
Agent: I'll be back. I'll be
Speaker 4: Putting it out. maybe a little bit more granular requirements from my point of view. We're not looking to replace our [ORG-1] solutions with anything with [ORG-2].
Speaker 4: We're just really looking to close the data exfiltration gaps that present currently when you just have a user with the [ORG-2] application accessing the application.
Speaker 4: So really what we're looking to do is ensure It's really more of a DLP controls that I would be looking for than an [ORG-1], but I know that they're sort of tied together in the relationship.
Speaker 4: So hopefully that also adds some clarity to the ask.
Agent: No, totally. So basically just to kind of summarize, [DATE-1] you guys do have an [ORG-1] and an [ORG-3] solution more on the corporate side. You're using mobile iron and in tune.
Agent: You're not looking for something that's going to replace those, but just enhance it to kind of have that end user control of, you know, who's looking at what where is that information going and if needed, you know, if there was, say, a compromised account, you would be able to essentially wipe that account clean.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I think so. And then also to ensure that the data flows approved. So I don't want critical IP information being pulled down and then potentially they could leave their device via personal email or some other method.
Agent: Ok, cool. So also to address something that [PERSON-1] mentioned earlier, so we won't be able to do a demo [DATE-1], but this is all really good information to grab for if doing a demo. This is possible.
Agent: It does make it a little harder since it's on the mobile app, but I'm pretty sure we might be able to.
Agent: [PERSON-1], did you happen to get a chance to look at the prerecorded demo that was sent over by [GPE-1] [DATE-2]?
EndUser: So I went through the little card thing that you guys sent. I clicked on it, logged in, I watched whatever videos on there, and then I shared the link with everybody on the call.
Agent: To kind of go through. Okay, gotcha.
Agent: And were there any kind of initial questions off of that?
Agent: That we could come
EndUser: Up with?
EndUser: Yeah, I'll defer to the team. I wasn't sure if you guys actually watched it or not.
Speaker 4: Yeah, no, I didn't get an opportunity.
Speaker 5: So I apologize. Yes, sorry, I didn't get the chance to.
Agent: Go ahead, first.
Agent: Yeah, I was just going to mention that, you know, that's, you know, I think that video is extremely helpful. And again, it showcases the features of like an offering.
Agent: And this is, you know, this product is kind of, you know, like in a way, it's pretty simple. So feel free to watch it. Let us know any questions that you might have.
Agent: If you need to engage our [ORG-4] team for some more, we'll be on your other questions. We can.
Agent: You know typically you know to the career of customers that you know that video answers good questions but if you have more questions on if we need to do a tailored demo then maybe we will but just out of this kind of a plug most of the information that we would show in the demo we're going to be extremely similar to that video but that would give you the ability to obviously and work on questions and things like that so I think that's a really good starting point I think that [PERSON-2] and I here taking the economy better understanding of where you stand.
Agent: And I did want to mention that [PERSON-1], I saw him in the email channel that you mentioned, hey, we're using this on the commercial side. We just want to make sure that it works with the truck ride.
Agent: And I just wanted to mention that we have a question. You can point it to anyone more than a plus. You can also make it to any other list in my so-called look up.
Agent: So, hopefully, I'll go over that.
Agent: Yeah, [PERSON-3], thank you for that. And then kind of in addition to what [PERSON-3] was saying, I did just drop a link in the chat of the [ORG-5] meet.
Agent: It does go into a little bit more detail around some of the enhanced Security features that you would be adding to the mobile app with the addition of the mobile publisher plus.
Agent: So it does have the ability to wipe app data and log out users. It blocks access. So kind of going back to that data flow. If you know.
Agent: For say, you know, [ORG-6] has certain requirements around updates to the device that the app is on, whether the user is or isn't on the most updated version
Speaker 4: Of iOS or things like that, it would be able to, you know, kick the user out if they aren't up to date on some of the [ORG-4] policies.
Speaker 4: Does it also, I mean, one of the issues that we're facing now is if we approve an individual to use a corporate device to connect.
Speaker 4: There's no other mechanism to prevent that user for using their personal device that doesn't have the DLP controls or the [ORG-4] settings in place.
Agent: So is it able to
Agent: Say, you know, [PERSON-4] can connect with this device but no other devices, for example?
Agent: Yeah, that's a good question. And yes, I believe that the [ORG-7] capability does give you the ability to restrict
Speaker 4: The mission as you'd like. So I believe
Agent: We are in the two, but I can double talk about folks here that are going to secure the two.
Agent: Yeah, that would be a show shopper for me if we can't support that.
Agent: Yeah, absolutely. So it sounds like that's definitely one of the action items we'll take back, is to see if we can block specific devices.
Agent: It looks like a lot of them do look at IP addresses, so that might be one way that it does it as well, but that might be at a higher level. So we'll definitely check on that.
Agent: But I guess as far as, you know, next steps are concerned, I think maybe what I'll do is I'll resend that demo and have the team take a look at that, and then maybe we can regroup [DATE-3] to see if there are any questions or concerns, or if there's just different areas within the demo
Speaker 4: That you want to take a deeper look at.
Speaker 4: Does that make sense for the team?
Agent: Yeah, I think that's a great plan. I'd like to digest the information a little bit, and then let's get back together [DATE-4]. Okay. Sounds good.
Agent: And, and, while I have you, how's everything else in the org running?
Agent: And you mentioned you guys went live in [DATE-5]. How's everything
EndUser: Else looking?
EndUser: Is the IT team loving supporting a second [GPE-2] Salesforce?
EndUser: I mean, it's running fine. I mean, on our side, you know, we support the, the [PERSON-5] version where [PERSON-6] side reports,
Agent: You know, they, he supports the commercial cloud side. So we're, we're basically segregated. So it's not like double work for any of us. Okay. Okay, cool, cool. Okay, nice. Well, I'm glad everything else is running well.
Agent: So like I said, I'll send over some additional materials for you guys to read through. Also, center of that demo
EndUser: And I'll suggest sometimes for [DATE-3], see what works for the team and just kind of go from there. Yep. So I'll just be for you guys to be aware. I'm off [DATE-4]. So, but I mean,
Agent: Feel free to catch up with these guys. They have more of the questions that I do anyway. So I'm just trying to facilitate for them. Yeah, no, that's totally fine.
Agent: [PERSON-7], [PERSON-8] and [PERSON-9], I'll send over sometimes for you guys to connect [DATE-4] and then happy to debrief with you after we have those calls.
EndUser: Then
Agent: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Okay. Awesome. Well, I appreciate the time [DATE-1], guys.
EndUser: Like I said, I'll send and we'll go from there.

Speaker 2: Was like, who has a call I can record?
Speaker 2: And I was like, you have to go with somebody else. But, cool. No, thanks again for the time.
Speaker 2: So what do you think of [EVENT-1]?
Speaker 2: And we met [PERSON-2] and [PERSON-3] and and everything.
EndUser: The demos Yeah, no, loved it. I mean, so as far as next steps go, I thought the meetings were really great. Like just from like a personal standpoint, like I'd probably lean more towards [PERSON-2]. I don't know.
EndUser: I just feel like we had better [PRODUCT-1] like if that makes sense and again, I'm really just going off of that purely not anything differently and I just really I think we're just waiting now internally on how to move forward.
Speaker 2: That [ORG-1] said
EndUser: So morning We're going to book that meeting with [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5] for [DATE-1].
Speaker 2: I said [PERSON-6] this
EndUser: I think he said do [DATE-1], because I think people are still out [DATE-2]. So we'll check calendars. I'll send you over some times where we can get that.
EndUser: And then I think we just maybe sync up really quickly just to walk through what that demo looks like. Because I think there's just a few things I'd prefer to focus on.
Speaker 2: Differently
EndUser: With [PERSON-5] and [PERSON-4] than I would. What we did with [PERSON-6].
EndUser: So yeah, and then I think me just seeing like the Data Cloud demos that like [PERSON-7] took me to were super helpful because I really, like I said.
EndUser: The thing that was really throwing me with Data Cloud was just like the amount of work and like the mapping of like the external stuff to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
EndUser: Yeah, it's such a crazy little screenshot that you get shown. And yeah, Yeah, looking at it in more of like a digestible way where it was like, okay, this is where you start.
Speaker 2: You're like, holy <inaudible>.
EndUser: And then this is where you end up was just easier for me to kind of comprehend to say, okay, maybe it's not as heavy of a lift as I thought. Right.
Speaker 2: And it's going
EndUser: To be. Um, and yeah, and then I think it's just really us just strategizing internally to start and I kind of feel like that's where [PERSON-6] is that right now.
Speaker 2: Of like where we want
EndUser: Like let's get [PERSON-4] and [PERSON-5] on board like the buy in on it first and then.
Speaker 2: That's when I would kind
EndUser: Of maybe work with you to put together like that. Crawl walk run plan like initially before we got any partners involved. That's another thing that I got to like walk through with [PERSON-6].
EndUser: Like, I mean, additional costs are we looking at?
Speaker 2: There. Like, what
EndUser: What is it entail?
EndUser: You know, I kind of have to, I
Speaker 2: Have to lay that picture out very easily for him before I go ahead and say, yeah, we're gonna go with. whatever to move forward. So yeah, no, it makes [QUANTITY-1] of sense.
Speaker 2: I think that kind of do some of that
EndUser: We can certainly in tandem ahead of time too. So again, this is timely and great and wanted to get you before the holiday to on that.
EndUser: Yeah, and then the only other thing, like, I mean, the [ORG-2] piece, I pinged our head of IT internally because just don't know how it works with who manages that [ORG-2] contract if it's us or if it's through [ORG-3].
Speaker 2: I
EndUser: So I just have to figure logistics of that before I can ask you to like to see about getting that [ORG-2] feature out the
Speaker 2: Intro me or do anything
Speaker 2: Into our org for [ORG-4].
Speaker 2: Is there anything we have right now that like put like I'm assuming there's some plug-in [ORG-2] for sale?
Speaker 2: I'd have to look as soon as you figure out who your [ORG-2] counterpart is internally. Let me know.
Speaker 2: To be honest, it looks like it's going to be managed by [ORG-3] because the way that the contracts sit and triton. It doesn't even show that you own [ORG-2]. So I imagine you're part of [ORG-5] agreement.
Speaker 2: But that wouldn't say that you wouldn't be able to transact on elevate at all. So if you figure that out, I'll look and see exactly what skew of Slack you guys have, and then what capabilities you have [DATE-3],
EndUser: And what you might be able to get turned on. I'm also curious if there's with the [ORG-4], the iHeart Slack.
Speaker 2: Anything we can piggyback off of
Speaker 2: Like, use it already or if they pay for it or if they have it, not just can there's a <inaudible> sale.
EndUser: If they
EndUser: We just get... Yeah, Yeah.
Speaker 2: I assume it's a paid add-on, right, for that sales thing. Yeah, it is and I don't know how much it is because it again, it's all based on user count.
Speaker 2: I don't know what your current price point to date is without like digging deeper because I could have thousands of users and you guys have this like just little carved out amount.
Speaker 2: So once you have that, let me know and we can get you in there and I'll send you
EndUser: A demo of that feature that you can vocalize. Okay, cool. Yep, that was going to be my next question to just like anything that I can circle around, [ORG-6] and then her sales managers
Speaker 2: Especially to like the
Speaker 2: Would be
EndUser: Would be good. Cool. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know if you, I don't know how you want to work. Okay.
Speaker 2: So we have our own. We have our own slack.
EndUser: You have your own Slack environment?
EndUser: Yeah, and [PERSON-8] was just sending me screenshots. Our installed apps have [ORG-4] connected. I just don't know what that looks like for...
EndUser: So he manages it. He says [ORG-4] looks to be installed.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right. Let me, let me do a little digging and see because [ORG-2]'s a little different in the sense of like, you could just send me your org ID for [ORG-4] and you know, it's the unique identifier.
Speaker 2: I think [ORG-2] has the exact same thing. But let me, let me ask a couple questions on how do we identify who you're part of.
Speaker 2: Because it's just different because [ORG-2] can spread like wildfire because you don't even have to like pay for [ORG-2] to sign up a lot of times.
Speaker 2: So companies, you know, people, they'll like sign up a hundred people at a time because, you know, and then there's a true up at [DATE-4] of like, well, you've had this many users leveraging, you only pay for this many.
Speaker 2: And then they true up. So it can get challenging in large organizations. Does.
EndUser: Does the [ORG-2] sales feature that we have,
EndUser: Can I tell it, right?
EndUser: We only have 10 salespeople the scope of our 86 users, do I need it?
Speaker 2: In right, that are logging in.
EndUser: So Like if it's a per user fee, do I have to pay for it for everybody?
EndUser: Or can I just pay for
Speaker 2: It for my sales team?
Speaker 2: I imagine, I don't know the exact answer. I imagine you can just enable it for sales. Like you would be able to enable analytics for sales. But again, let me confirm that as well.

007517_167_6qr3y000000oe2hAAA,"Agent: So what we're looking at is [PRODUCT-1] and in the employee productivity plus key that civic and will have you have a set of template dashboards. It's really similar to this.
Agent: Concierge, we use as the place for all employees to get information on anything that you need as a general employee itself. So that's HR, generally that's IT.
Agent: And it's sort of the first port of call for any questions that you might have. You can see that the most common ones that we obviously have internally are request software and request access to orgs.
Agent: Those four talks that would be non-standard .
Agent: And then there's obviously some trending articles that here [PERSON-1] access, [PERSON-2] is our [PRODUCT-2] and lots of people across the country obviously want to learn more about that at the moment.
Agent: But I will type in here, I don't know for argument sake, let's go with holidays.
Agent: So how do I put holiday off?
Agent: Global holiday schedules, let's go into here, it says Okay, not quite what I wanted. And maybe if I typed in one of
Agent: Those [GPE-1]. the absence guide tell me what I'm entitled to a standard. and it will give me a link to the process and how to do it.
Agent: So just open another tab, which is linked out to a quick document, which is kind of like a [PRODUCT-3] document.
Agent: So you could have that link to your website of your system, but this is the portal to find it. It also is linking here to the volunteer impact tab.
Agent: So I mentioned the other day that we do a lot of volunteering. All of our hours ago.
Agent: And then the donations that we make to charities and match and all of that is logged in here And this was built on platform And I think we've moved to either a partner [ORG-1] or to a third party [ORG-2] y to help us with this because I think it was better integrations with the charity side .
Agent: But yeah, can you get the idea, right?
Agent: What you're looking at now is a knowledge article. So that would be built inside yourself also can then exposed by this experienced cloud web page to the user. With a couple of cool attractions at the bottom of it.
Agent: So I didn't find what I wanted. It's taking me to another site here, signing me in to work day. And that's where I can go and actually log my holiday and from there on into the other system.
Agent: Or I can log a ticket and that.
Agent: Can do, whether it's standard or whether it needs mor e urgent attention, and I can go in there And then once I've logged that ticket I can go into the My Tickets section which is at the top right there And you can see some previous ones So for my wellness reimbursement this was a ticket that was created Pretty automated process here, but I jus t have to sort of upload my receipt for the gym membershi p that I have in them, so I was forced to bring it best me for [PERSON-3]: Here's one that needed a little bit more interaction, just to help me get access to a bit of software inside our [ORG-3] org. So that's concierge. You can see it's
EndUser: Not particularly complex, but that's probably by design.
EndUser: Right?
EndUser: It's easier to find everyone.
Agent: So in terms of what's actually needed for us, certainly for phase one, essentially is the design of that page that we're seeing right now. Yeah, and they're keen on our team.
Agent: Pro-service system just keen that you have an idea of what you want and an opinion on the design.
Agent: Like saying, they're are included in the license, a load of templates and we could go with those, but we want to make sure that you're making the right decision. Yeah.
Agent: We then have a couple of more experience sites that I'll show you. Now these are probably would be kind of an out scope for what we're doing, at least in this initial phase.
Agent: But just to give you an idea of where it could go, you could spin up a separate. for example for your sales people, and this one is for all sellers at [ORG-3], [PERSON-4] being the name of a character.
Agent: So, Again, they've actually recently redone this. But if we've got problems with building a quote, for example, I can go in here and it's starting to list out all the Knowledge Articles that I need.
Agent: But in this place, let's look in for some legal support to help me get some language into a deal.
Agent: So during the quoting process, it's telling me here, OK, so if you're looking for a. some language that relates to a specific product then you can go to the Product Towns directory and actually this is an FYI this is a publicly facing piece So if we look at that .
Agent: License type that you're actually going to be purchasing. You can see here all the product homes that's associated with that. Generally we don't change our product terms.
Agent: But if we wanted to and we needed to, all we wanted to add in another special term or the customer's asking for something that was non-standard.
Agent: And there are a couple of these in our deal as well when I would go down here, and look across... I need some language from [ORG-4]. I would link to requests inside ourselves for [PERSON-5].
EndUser: What we're going to do, support
Agent: And then I would link to the quote number that's been generated inside ourselves for [PERSON-5], and then type in and why I need help with that.
Agent: And again, there's an easy place for me to track all my support cases from a service in the sales help perspective. So you can see whether it's sales ops, whether it's sales alignment, which is typically accounts.
Agent: Needing to be moved to a different name or whether it's legal or billing and all those sorts of cases you've dealt wit h in our [GPE-2] experience .
Agent: And the last one I wanted to show is our talent experience site, which is again built on experience cloud.
Agent: And I was on board [DATE-1] now, I've been here just over [DATE-2], but believe that this is where all new starters would go.
Agent: As well as us employees that have been here a little longer to improve skills and sign onto courses or sort of better understand and who we are so you can see sort of the values and the onboarding programs sort of all faith from here.
Agent: So whether we're in new hire or boom man, let's have a little look shall we?
Agent: And discovering self-force. It gives you quite clear pieces on the programme and pieces of it. The thing that I really like about it is the ability to
Agent: To choose courses. So we obviously work with a number of third-party training providers.
Agent: If we go into this piece, there's a piece that's all, again, powered by [ORG-3] to help you book on to a training court as an employee, and then it tracks your attendance. And logs are different places in there.
Agent: But we could choose something in region, something as a sputtering people later. It's definitely not. because they mostly worldwide, but in turn coaching piece, people just sign up to that and start to serve on demand.
Agent: So yeah, there's a few different ways that you can take the technology. You'll have the ability to do everything within the licensing that your first string you'll have the ability to do and So all those use cases.
EndUser: Everything that I've just shown.
Agent: Yeah, when we actually get our paperwork signed, we can get you more and more closely aligned with [PERSON-6]: Experience designers, etc.
Agent: But yeah, hopefully

007835_167_6qr3y000000oiOtAAI,"Agent: So yeah, I don't know, [PERSON-1] or [PERSON-2] and whichever you want to start just like, it would be great to like learn more about like your role at caraway and what your like goals within your role are just like the higher level vision of it yourself.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: So we're. We're going through some structural changes with our commercial team and kind of broader team.
EndUser: Right now, my title is Head of Special Projects, but I kind of sit across a lot of the business, some of which includes commercial, which is why I'm here, obviously.
EndUser: But right now, It's a little hard to say what the commercial team will look like in [DATE-1]. We're working on bringing in someone to really help drive our commercial processes.
EndUser: So it might be the case where like a month from now we're having this conversation again and like re looking at sales force and how we want to set it up.
EndUser: But in the time being, and then [PERSON-2] on past it to you just to talk about your role, I think.
EndUser: One thing that we haven't been doing since we've been on [ORG-1] is really effectively tracking all of our contacts in one place.
EndUser: We're still using a lot of different [ORG-2] Sheets where we had lists of people's names, roles, companies, like [ORG-3]'s [ORG-4] and trying to track when the last Outreach was, what form of communication we used.
EndUser: And as a result, it's just now scattered across multiple different spreadsheets.
EndUser: And so one thing we'd really like to do is consolidate all of that and move it into [ORG-1] because I think previously the way the team had been doing it [PERSON-3] s more just on like the larger like singular company opportunity as opposed to tracking like al l different people that they're reaching out to say like get that opportunity into the pipeline That makes sense and so one thing that we'd like to do is just like have a bette r system for tracking like all the way from like the first piece of Outreach like say for example we reached out to like 10 people.
EndUser: At like [ORG-1] to like try to get in contact.
EndUser: And then we wanna like track each of those 10 people, be able to see like when we re-pings them that we're logging that in [ORG-1], like what sort of response if any, when like a meeting gets scheduled, we like, we just wanna be able to like have metrics throughout each part of the process to say like, okay, it takes like, I don't know, like 28 pieces of Outreach to get one meeting conversion.
EndUser: And then like 10 meetings or touch points to like convert to like a client. from just like a prospecting opportunity.
EndUser: So we still want that like view that we hav e our event team had previously which was like the pipeline view so it was lik e I think it was like proposal phase like we had a bunch of different phases to lik e lead to the eventual like booked one .
EndUser: Like end of the sales process, but we also want like the very beginning where we see like, who do we reach out to and like what sort of response do we get.
EndUser: But I'll pause there [PERSON-2], do if you want to talk a little bit about your role and anything else that you think would be helpful to see.
Speaker 4: Yeah, no, I totally agree with what [PERSON-1] just said, which I feel like it's kind of the more basic size. First to use so far. So definitely getting that loaded in touch.
Speaker 4: But my role, I wear many hats, I guess. But I work both on our Marketing and help with partnerships and sales. And
Speaker 4: Yeah, we're in a transition a little bit.
Agent: But that's
Speaker 4: Kind of where I drive new partnerships. I guess it's my main role.
Agent: Got it. And so just to reiterate, like. looking to track like the getting more partnerships started and like tracking that those trends.
EndUser: Yeah.
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Agent: Is there like a team that so okay, I guess once a pro-us set, I mean a partnership is started, is that like, is that information being tracked somewhere too?
Agent: Or how does I know you're in a big transition phase.
EndUser: That work?
Agent: A lot of this is just like, I
EndUser: Don't know like once. Once we've like won a client per se, it kind of moves like outside of this team.
EndUser: And I don't think we necessarily be looking to track it in [ORG-1], at least not [DATE-2], like any like sort of like account management, touch points sits like with the different team.
EndUser: So it's more like all of the work leading up to like closing, like signing like the deal and then transitioning it to like an existing
Agent: Client is when it moves out of this team. Work on it. Okay. Um, and then
EndUser: You've used [ORG-1] before. One of you would use it a little bit. Yeah, I used to that.
EndUser: It was like a version of it at one of my old companies that it was like, purpose-built for what they were doing. And it was called job science. I have no idea if that's used by other companies.
EndUser: But that's where one feature that I really liked was the reporting that happened. I think it was like every month, maybe, or maybe it was [DATE-3] that just showed how many emails were sent and buy who.
EndUser: And so I think that's why I think that's why I'm not a person.
EndUser: Like how many meetings were had or like you could like run a report on like a specific project to see like everything that had like happened
Agent: Within that like client or like project. Okay. Yeah, I mean, we have different I can study like some overview videos of like getting started in sales force and those might be helpful with like.
Agent: Some suggestions on how to set it up for tracking this, tracking that and just like seeing what is best. I know it's, we're kind of in the same spot we haven't really used it yet.
EndUser: Were in the last call cause you
Agent: So cause you just got to ask. So I mean, if you have specific questions,
EndUser: Feel free to like pick our brains on them, but. Thanks. I mean, if you want to send up for those videos, that's great.
EndUser: And then maybe it makes sense for [PERSON-2] and I to like spend [DATE-4] getting familiar and like getting set up and then we can reach out if they're specific.
Agent: Questions that we have. Okay. I think that makes a lot of sense especially because you said a lot might change in the like.
EndUser: [DATE-5] or so. So I don't want to to do it.
Agent: Yeah, I get Yeah, I get to do it. We have
Speaker 4: Done process changes. Yeah. I do one question. Like we mentioned how we've been using the sheets and the tracks are an outreach.
Speaker 4: Like is there a way to somehow like if it's in the right format, upload those to [ORG-1] or is it more manual?
Agent: I think if you download them as a CSV, you can upload them as contacts or accounts. I don't know how they're labeled in [ORG-5], but I'm sure I feel there's [ORG-2] uploading [ORG-2] Sheets list into [ORG-1].
Agent: There's probably a lot of helpful overviews.
Speaker 4: Leave it to [PERSON-4] and I'll have all the answers.
Agent: Yeah, it's pretty straightforward. Just as long as you're aligning the columns in your Google Sheet into specific fields in [ORG-1], then you can input that data however you want to.
Agent: That might be a good place to start, just like taking a look at those sheets and starting to get those into [ORG-1].
Agent: And then seeing if there are any roadblocks that come up and then we can always help with anything else that's coming your way as you're starting to get it all set up.
Speaker 4: Yeah. That was perfect. Thank you. You're welcome.
Agent: I know we have a lot of time left, but I can send those resources. Let me know if things come up [DATE-6] Perfect.
EndUser: And happy to help.

Agent: But I'm talking with [PERSON-1] about doing something similar on the sales side.
Agent: How do we grease the wheels there too?
Agent: Because they are hiring people and that's great, but doesn't mean we don't want to optimize their ability to execute.
Agent: So thinking about [PRODUCT-1] automation, what's on [ORG-1], what's not, what data like either needs to come on to [ORG-1] or can be connected in a different way.
Agent: So he's very curious to see the progress you may hear because I think some of the things will be applicable.
Agent: And I think some of them also don't just touch like service cloud, but the more we learn, I imagine there will be some [ORG-2] because I know you're a heavy [ORG-2] user.
Agent: So very curious to see how you're using it now, how can we layer in [PRODUCT-1], and especially the new innovations coming out there as well. and then kind of reapply that same strategy to sales.
Agent: The question I had before I take a look at this is why now?
Agent: I mean, is it because you're scaling so quickly and you're just reaching this point of like we need to level up or what had you start doing the work with neuroflash around the community and is there any seasonality like [EVENT-1] that you're like we need to get this done by then?
EndUser: Yeah, you know, what's my compelling event?
EndUser: There isn't one, you know, I guess the question isn't really why now. It's probably more, how's it going, which this has been a continual continuous evolution over a long period of time.
EndUser: We were talking with [PERSON-2] about implementing the portal because [DATE-1], [DATE-2], we didn't even have a customer portal. All customers just sent emails to us.
EndUser: And so we've been slowly progressing, certainly not at the rate and pace that I would consider successful or aggressive. I think we can always move a little bit faster. But we have our own limitations.
EndUser: I mean, so embedded into all departments.
Agent: [ORG-1] is
EndUser: And we have a small, but mighty [ORG-1] administration team that definitely needs to do a lot with a little.
Agent: And how do we
EndUser: Make sure that we get the time and the tension that we need to drive continuous improvement on our side operational improvement system improvement.
EndUser: And then unlocking new features and functionality, whether it be the portal, whether it be implementing [ORG-3], whether it be AI, things like that.
EndUser: So it's... No compelling event other than this is the only way we win is to have technology right along scale.
Agent: With our continuous Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up actually because, [PERSON-3], we have a session [DATE-3] that's going over what you have [DATE-4] because actually we injected a few things like call coaching and listening, I the script that we can provide you here.
Agent: You already have that cadences they already have that so he's going to, he, I know he hired an additional team member as well.
Agent: So yes, we'll go over what you have so that he can help your team continue to unlock things that could be valuable. And then we can layer in.
Agent: I will share this talk with you and it is intended to be collaborative. So updated, change it. Based on [TIME-1] we spoke, I just kind of threw down three different priorities as to how I understood it.
Agent: We can adjust these, but I just wanted us to be kind of grounded in your goals and then. What's important here is like the next step feels like a reverse demo.
Agent: Let's see what you're doing now whether it's in Service Cloud or [ORG-2] and then tell you, hey, you have this, you could be doing this and you don't have this, but it would achieve this.
Agent: So that's some combination of discovery, shadowing in [FAC-1] and [ORG-2]. [PERSON-4], [PERSON-5], [PERSON-6], like they'll know who to incorporate is like, [PERSON-7], someone who should be on those.
Agent: I know I think he was involved in some of the customer community conversations.
EndUser: Yeah, I mean, so
EndUser: There's a lot to show, right?
EndUser: And I worry about how far down a rabbit hole we might go on is interesting, but not a priority.
Agent: Something that
EndUser: And so perhaps, As we align on this, before we execute a reverse demo, probably it's me working with [PERSON-5] to say, let's prioritize, like, where do we feel we need the most help that will provide the most impact to those three goals that you put up top?
EndUser: Because I think you may help us discover that as we learn a little bit more, but I want to avoid, shiny object syndrome whereby we and we're like, oh, let's do that.
Agent: See a really cool thing
EndUser: But it doesn't really progress in a material way, the value or impact that we're bringing to braze, although we're doing that cool new thing that may help, but may help in a microcosm versus what I would consider the value [ORG-4] needs to bring to braze overall.
EndUser: So I think that's maybe the one thing that I would interject between like.
EndUser: Locking this down and then doing that reverse demo is just that like the areas that we should really drill into because we'll always have time to show you more and go deeper you can really hone in I think that would be helpful.
Agent: Prioritization of
Agent: Into Yeah right Yeah, like what does comprehensive look like for this?
Agent: And that's exactly why I wanted to have this conversation because we are excited to start doing the work and then we get down there and we're like, wait, are we done with discovery or are we still, because we're always gonna still have questions.
Agent: So I've included this, I'll share this with you.
Agent: Let me know to the degree that you want us to participate in that conversation because I'm also including some high level sessions that are coming up based on what seemed relevant and then...
Agent: I'm gonna have to send you this video , it is like [TIME-2] , [PERSON-8], this is the vector .
Agent: This vector thing that came up on, it came up at the end of our last call, [PERSON-9], and it just feels like the right.
Agent: Is the Data Cloud
Agent: And that's a solution too quickly because we still have a lot of discovery to do, but it's something worth taking a look at because just so you can conceptualize potentially where we're going.
Agent: Because it's going to help group some of the things that [PERSON-4] mentioned where like you're struggling with knowledge Cases and so I think it's super applicable.
Agent: So this is intended to provide a little bit of perspective while you're having that conversation with [PERSON-5]. And then we can formalize this plan and go do it.
EndUser: Sounds good. Yeah, so if you want to send me that send me the video as well. I'll watch them both My next connection with [PERSON-5] is scheduled for [DATE-5] the 5th.
EndUser: I will use a good amount of my one-to-one time to Share this with him as long as you're good with me sharing it with him And for us to kind of talk through how we want to narrow down That list of prioritization where we can do some of that demoing and say hey, here's where we think You guys might be able to add the most value to either unlock what we already have or extend into new opportunity spaces where you can, you know, we can, we can do something together.

Agent: What exactly is your interest idea?
Agent: What are the challenges?
Agent: And then accordingly I will align the right solution for you probably from [ORG-2].
Agent: So like [PERSON-3] said, you know, firstly, I've been to your website, but it'll be great if you can, you know, give me a brief introduction about yourself and about [GPE-1] and then we can get in the details of the requirements.
Speaker 3: Yeah, so I so Capwise group basically has like [TIME-2] series. One is a holding company that looks after this investment banking Second, we are looking in [ORG-3]Agent: Transactions.
Speaker 3: So we are lenders and directly lent to the company's startups and MSMEs. Okay. third is the subsidiary company which is into distribution.
Speaker 3: They are [ORG-4] which is lending service providers to the customers like they are connected to multiple banks and [ORG-5].

Agent: So from an [ORG-8] perspective, sales force obviously is the right platform been working with above banking, financial institutions, [ORG-5] in the country and most of them are using [ORG-10].
Speaker 3: We've
Agent: In fact, the biggest [ORG-6] of the country uses sales force as an LOS system. However, for the LMS part, I would say, yes, that is not out of the box from [ORG-2] offering.
Agent: The loan management system is something that we integrate with other LMS pieces, but [ORG-8] completely end to end with, you know, right from that you receive for loan inquiries to the complete processing approvals and ongoing servicing of it.
Speaker 3: The inquiries
Agent: All that can be managed on [ORG-2]. But my then my next question is since you have already invested in [GPE-2] and you've already got their LOS LMS.
Agent: So now would you be looking to probably use it for some time and then evaluate because I understand you must have gone through a big evaluation and then you have finalized on it.
Agent: Okay, so is there any help that you need from our side at this point of time?
Speaker 3: To
Agent: Probably, you know, how can we align if there's any other interest area for you, wherein one may be for your other companies, will make sense because if you already have [ORG-8] and you're just implementing it, I'm not sure it makes sense for us to have this discussion, but yes, happy to take guidance from you.
Speaker 3: But any what fails
Speaker 3: So, you are majorly into providing that lead management service, I guess, right?
Agent: See from a banking and financial It's a complete loan management.
Speaker 3: Perspective.
Agent: So, not loan origination system that is [GPE-3]
Speaker 3: But in origination complete application part comes right right from onboarding the customer till the disbursement But you're not into that I guess last time I interacted with your team.
Agent: At least. Yes.

Agent: Which is only very specific tailor made for financial servicing [ORG-17] and that completely manages this entire end to end cycle for and this includes the [ORG-8] piece as well.
Agent: There's a lot of other bits about it, basically a complete package but the [ORG-8] is a big part of the financial Service Cloud and I think now [PERSON-5] also have the financial Service Cloud rather than company.
Agent: I'd still have to go and check that. So yes, that's the [ORG-8] pieces, but it's the way it belongs, it's false .

EndUser: But we just wanted for basic contact information and wanted to, but it was.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Yeah, there was not.
Agent: Yeah. And then... That's one of the things that we hear a lot is just pricing is always relevant.
Agent: And so usually the approach we like to take is kind of a legos approach of like, all right, whatever you all need that's most important, let's do that. And so if that's however many licenses, like let's do that.
Agent: And then if you all need other.
Agent: Components add on to that down the road then we can do that then but you know We never want price to be a reason why we you know can't do business with folks
EndUser: Yeah, so we were fine with the price, but then the company that you guys recommended to us that we hired to orientate was terrible.
Agent: Okay the partner
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: They couldn't.
EndUser: I tried to explain to them what [ORG-1] had did with the nonprofit and with the, you know, we could schedule workflows if this happens and then these six or seven things happen and an email comes [DATE-3] before and an email goes [DATE-3] out and I forget what that's called.

EndUser: Well, I see this chat and you know, we're ready for, we're moving forward with the [DATE-5] election. We oversee that.

007772_167_6qr3y000000g2B1AAI,"Agent: Please go ahead. Okay.
Speaker 3: So currently we are working with [LOC-1]. Yes, they are the [ORG-1] partner and they have given certain APIs or cases, calls and meeting. And some of the call, some of the APIs were APIs for creation.
Agent: Just get
Agent: Right. The problem that
Speaker 3: We are currently facing is the latency of those APIs.
Agent: They are taking
Speaker 3: Very long, [QUANTITY-1] to retrieve data to create a world for any That will actually cause a problem at our end because we are In our dashboard, we are directly fetching all the information from [ORG-1].
Agent: Entity to data.
Agent: Directly fetching.
Speaker 3: So it can create a bad user experience. The seller has, if our client has to stay in the second [TIME-1].
Agent: For around three, Hmm.
Speaker 3: We can show you the latency.
Agent: Yeah, I think that'll make sense.
Agent: So is this an issue you're only facing with respect to reports and dashboards?
Speaker 3: With respect to the API, it's called API and cases API.
Agent: Okay, case is [ORG-2] got it probably you can just you know show me as
Speaker 3: You know Can you show the postman's area and share this Okay, so
Speaker 3: You can take you to the first So for example, to generate the door, it is taking around like 175 [NORP-1].
Agent: To
Speaker 3: Like right now [TIME-2].
Agent: Literally took Yeah, I mean, yeah, this looks good, but generally you're saying that it's
Speaker 3: I mean like [TIME-3] are like, it's not a good, like our current day is all taking 33 to 50ms. Okay.
Agent: So I am actually looking at, you know, one of the reported, I mean, if I can call this an issue, you know, rest API calls are sort of taking [TIME-4] is something that we have gotten an issue report of, but I'm also sort of seeing what are some responses.
Speaker 3: So is this an issue that you've been beginning or is this that has happened in a timely manner during implementation?
Agent: Facing from the
Speaker 3: There is no problem that we have been facing since the beginning.
Agent: We thought that going from [FAC-1] to products would increase the speed but essentially it didn't help. Yeah, correct. I mean, I don't think there would be a difference, ideally, because it would get, I mean, yes,
Speaker 3: This latency issue has been reported. Let me do one thing. Anything else, you know, [PERSON-1] you know, that you feel because currently we were planning to, we were planning to deploy But because of we couldn't deploy and team,
Agent: [DATE-1]. this latency issue, and we're corresponding it to [DATE-2], [DATE-3]. So we are hoping that we could get a faster resolution on this type of deployment. No, I think makes sense.
Agent: Let me just actually, for this, we would also internally have to go back to our product team.
Agent: Just probably give me a day while I also raise this up in one of our reports because I do see that this has been reported as well.
Agent: So let me some sort of a response or some work around that we can have with respect get back with
Speaker 3: To latency.
Speaker 3: Have you also spoken this?
Agent: To the partner regarding to our teams.
Speaker 3: Because I do understand that we need to go back internally for this . We have and their basically do
Agent: Spoken to partners response here, that they couldn't much in case of standards. So we also get in touch with
Speaker 3: Suggested that we would you guys once. Yeah, no, I think makes sense. I think point noted, you know, you want to regarding I think in that is also it will come [MONEY-1].
Agent: Have some other examples calls or cases.
Speaker 3: Also, this is the basic step baby will be
Agent: Like the any open for right?
Agent: So, like in [DATE-4], it is taking a second and
Speaker 3: These are the awaiting calls so that will increase the time on the screen.
Agent: Correct, correct. Yes, I understand.
Agent: What is the minimum time you've seen?
Agent: Like minimum is around 330 MS. OK, got it. I think point noted. Let me take back, you know, this as an action action item for us.
Agent: And let me get back to you on, you know, any sort of a response that we can give you, you know, with respect to the latency.
Speaker 3: Right, right. So
Agent: If you need any payload let us know.
Speaker 3: Or any information for the most, please
Agent: Yes. Right.
Speaker 3: One more thing. We have many batch operations like when doing the rest API. So, so, like [TIME-5], and then we have [TIME-6].
Agent: I'll take almost
Agent: I see any sort of a batch process, is it?
Speaker 3: I'll just show anything else but this simple one.
Agent: One is kind of like the last time this will
Speaker 3: I don't know, be going to speak. So these two little came like going to be have like kind of big payload for that these are around
Agent: Five [TIME-7]. Oh, this is not bad bad.
Speaker 3: Actually. This is not it.
Agent: Yeah, this is not bad.
Speaker 3: Okay, got But from our point of view, we do like operations on 38 to 57 MS.
Agent: We do that. Got it.
Agent: I understand and [DATE-5] I mean I do recollect talking about Redshift and so on the [ORG-3] has been completed.
Agent: [PERSON-2] this is also a question to you in case we are aware of you know the Integration having been completed.
Agent: This particular one I think is there with their community portal because it's not community portal right.
Speaker 3: Sorry I couldn't
Agent: Get you.
Agent: Can you?
Agent: So I was talking about the Integration with Redshift Maha.
Agent: I'll have to check that in case
Speaker 3: I'm making those. I don't have a parent
Agent: Idea about.
Agent: Sure. I can check
Agent: And get back to you. No problem. No
Speaker 3: Problem. Yeah. Yes.
Agent: Got it. Sure. I am also looking at, yeah, I think this is a document shared by Right.
Speaker 3: Virtual X, right?
Speaker 3: That's fine.
Agent: Sure. I have
Speaker 3: Certain examples where it is taking around.
Agent: I point that first
Speaker 3: Think you got the thing is taking this is the first step of it is again so
Agent: Anything so
Speaker 3: Yeah
Agent: Yeah
Speaker 3: Yeah around 500 it is taking right now But in some cases, it takes more than one second.
Agent: That are responsible for needing this latency. No, I think let me figure out on that and also get back to you with...
Agent: I mean, I don't think I will have to get back to you with the documentation, but rather how can we make this better or how can we sort of normalize, even if it is 393, I mean, while probably it might not match up to 65, that you have right now.
Speaker 3: With respect to
Speaker 3: Correct, correct. Let and you know, just get back to Right.
Agent: Me check on this internally you on some of the parameters. Okay. One more doubt.
Speaker 3: With that we can close.
Agent: Like
Speaker 3: Even if the whatever solutions you come up side, the internal side, even if it takes [DATE-6] to If we define the Integration on our side, eventually whenever latency issue, it will be fixed from ours.
Agent: On the internal
Agent: Change it.
Agent: You fix that
Speaker 3: It will be on our side also. Correct, correct, absolutely.
Agent: I think we don't have any more problem as of now. make sense. I think then this would be a [GPE-1].
Agent: I think the action item lies with us, right, to just come back to you with any sort of resolution, any sort of optimizations that can be done. So just give us some time.
Agent: I would definitely try to get this back to you
Speaker 3: By [DATE-7], so that we are able to see how we can rectify the latency time.
Agent: All right, okay. We were just hoping that the forward deployment, if it's possible.

005173_167_6qr3y000000sbQUAAY,"Speaker 3: For the advisory tools?
Speaker 3: Does it also encounter, for example, the [GPE-1] tooling or do you have a counterpart in the [GPE-1] as well?
Speaker 4: Yeah, so I have a counterpart in the [GPE-1] as well. And I have a counterpart in [GPE-2] as well. So we really look at each market and let them run as fast as it possibly can.
Speaker 4: And when they start running slower, then we consolidate. But before then, we focus on each and everyone to be able to move it absolutely fast as possible. So that's why it is that way.
Agent: My suggestion is that it's [TIME-1] past one that we respect every one's time and get going.
Agent: I just started the Recording so we can share it later with through with [PERSON-1] and more people of course but let's start and see if [PERSON-2] joins. That is my suggestion. Do Yep.
Speaker 4: You agree [NORP-1]?
Speaker 4: Yep.
Speaker 3: And I guess maybe to do a short introduction round because I include [GPE-3] our [GPE-1] sales representative, the folks [DATE-1] on the [GPE-1] for your information while it.
Agent: Who is [NORP-1],
EndUser: Given
Speaker 3: The presentation part you will give.
Speaker 3: I most of it in a previous session [DATE-2] with [NORP-1] and [PERSON-2] but maybe you can touch mainly the [GPE-1] topics for the Recording and then we can do the demo on the specific [GPE-1] financial planning solution [NORP-1] you asked for in a second stage.
EndUser: Already did
Speaker 4: Are important
Speaker 3: But maybe good to start, [PERSON-3], with an interest.
EndUser: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Thanks, [PERSON-4]. And again, apologies if you just walked in just as I was finishing introducing myself. So I'll go again. So, [PERSON-5], I'm based in [GPE-4]. I joined [ORG-1] [DATE-3].
EndUser: So I've been here for [DATE-4] now, prior to [ORG-1]. I spent most of my career working in financial services. So I actually was a financial planner.
EndUser: Worked in various banks, building societies, and also spent some time at one of our existing clients at [ORG-2]. So have a good understanding on the wealth management industry as well.
EndUser: Later on, moved into sort of more tech-based roles, so more kind of [ORG-3] propositions, building kind of robo-advice hybrid platforms. And I've recently just come over from heading up business development at a large pension fund.
EndUser: In the [GPE-1], so hopefully my experience can help to better understand what the trigger points are for the advisors in the [GPE-1] and sort of main challenges for them.
Speaker 4: Yes, because I thought there would be somebody representing [GPE-1] from [LOC-1] here as well. But hopefully [PERSON-2] will join.
EndUser: Okay, is [PERSON-6] based as well?
Speaker 4: No, but he's focused on processes for And then he said that he would invite people from the [GPE-1] business.
EndUser: Uk.
Speaker 4: And I was just supposed to be listening in because I was interested. So I think if we don't manage to get them here, it feels kind of a waste of our time.
Agent: I'm [PERSON-7] right now we'll see what happens.
Speaker 4: Yeah, where else I have some other things I need to attend to.
EndUser: Yeah, just before I go into the presentation, because again, I'm just conscious of we don't want to repeat anything.
EndUser: Was there anything in particular specific you wanted me to focus on or anything that you thought was while covering first or could go straight into the presentation?
Speaker 4: What's this question to me or?
EndUser: Yeah, it's obvious yet.
Speaker 4: Well, because like from my perspective, we are focusing mainly on financial goals or financial planning. in this stage from [GPE-5]'s perspective because that's kind of where we are.
Speaker 4: Then I just wanted to join this to look at what you had more, but this presentation was mainly for the [GPE-1].
Speaker 4: Not for me, I was just supposed to listen in to see kind of the bigger picture of how we could use the product.
Speaker 4: So if it's only me in this meeting, it feels kind of a waste of all our times.
Speaker 3: Yeah, I agree. And the intention was especially to focus on the [GPE-1] especially that nitty gritty furniture planning like on.
Speaker 4: Capabilities. And that's
Speaker 4: Taxation and so
Speaker 3: And how are we deal with that?
Speaker 3: It's an enhancement of tooling I showcase you [DATE-5] before [NORP-1]. Yeah, Yeah, let's exactly.
Speaker 4: And that I have covered, so I think. look. Yeah, what [PERSON-2] is saying and if he could join, I think it's great. Or else we should reschedule.
Agent: I just think, so let's give him strange because he usually is on time or sense in text that he's trying to find the room. But let's give him [TIME-2]. Otherwise we can reschedule. Yeah.
Speaker 4: Sure.
Speaker 3: Maybe in the meantime, following up the session we had the question [DATE-2].
Speaker 4: You
Speaker 3: Also discussed that it would be good to further deep dive. For example, API structures, pricing a [NORP-2] perspective.
Speaker 4: Structures more from

For example, the sales representative asked about the buyer's current approach to financial planning and how the proposed solution could help address specific challenges. The sales representative also asked about the buyer's thoughts on API structures and pricing, which suggests a willingness to tailor the solution to the buyer's specific needs.

Some examples of questions that were tailored to the buyer's responses include:

* ""So, I understand you have a counterpart in [GPE-1] as well. Can you tell me more about your experience with [GPE-1]?""
* ""You mentioned working in financial services and tech-based roles. How do you think our solution could help address the challenges you've faced in those roles?""

* The lack of representation from the [GPE-1] team, with the buyer expressing that it feels like a waste of time without their participation.
* The buyer's initial intention was to focus on financial goals and financial planning, but they were also interested in exploring the product's capabilities, particularly in taxation and dealing with [GPE-1] tooling.

These objections were addressed by the sales representative by:

* Offering to reschedule the meeting if [PERSON-2] cannot join, and suggesting a short introduction round to cover the basics before proceeding with the presentation.
* Acknowledging the buyer's concerns about the lack of representation from the [GPE-1] team and expressing agreement that it would be beneficial to have them present.

Agent: Hey, I'm calling out of the blue here. I'll make it brief.
EndUser: You took over the account from.

EndUser: But [PERSON-4], [PERSON-4], [PERSON-4].
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: Anything for our last thing, but get it.
Agent: Yeah. Yes.
EndUser: So you're, you're [GPE-1] as well.
Agent: No, I'm actually in [GPE-2], but I'm part of the business development team and the account director, her name, [PERSON-5], she's out of [PERSON-6] So once we had our change in [DATE-1], they kind of shuffled some accounts.
Agent: So yeah, I wanted to call, introduce myself and looks like you guys had kind of extensively back in [DATE-2] and [DATE-3]. So I wanted to see if you had some time.
Agent: [DATE-4] or next to connect with the new team and just kind of touch base on timeline and things of that nature. Okay.
EndUser: Yeah, right now, timeline is the great mystery to me. Everybody is in agreement. I need something for the team. I've got total agreement all the way board directors, everybody. What they don't agree with is spending any money.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Which is, that's the usual state of affairs for those companies. So I'm.
Agent: Yeah,
EndUser: I'm in sales too. I get it. But.
Agent: I know.
EndUser: Anyway,
Agent: Well, so it kind of all give my like [MONEY-1] really quick.
Agent: It looks like the last time you had chatted your day, you were just looking at our Enterprise Edition filled cloud and maybe some of our service systems.
Agent: Not sure if since you had chatted with [PERSON-4], she had mentioned anything regarding our pro suite. It's actually like, you know, Implementation included sales, service and Marketing all in one.
Agent: And it's specifically for businesses, your size and with kind of limited budget.
Agent: So that would definitely help, I think, if you've had, you know, do you have [TIME-1] to speak so that we can talk you through that a little bit?
Agent: And maybe you can relay that to the rest of your team and see how they feel about it.
EndUser: Oh, Well, I'm the one making the decision there.
Agent: Cool.
EndUser: But I have to kind of cram this down there for us.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Right now we're using fridge sheets, and they all know it's a pain in the <inaudible>. But I have a hard enough time getting them to use the fridge sheets. They are starting to use them.
EndUser: It's just they get a lot of mumbles and grumbles about it.
EndUser: So if there's a less expensive solution, because one of the things I've been tasked with.
EndUser: Which I haven't had time to do because I'm in test with a lot is to do a totally new evaluation and raise it up for the board.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: To justify the expense.
EndUser: And one thing that we looked at with [ORG-1] when we were talking to [PERSON-7] was that because you guys have the whole service arm in there as well, which had the virtual presence through the phone.
EndUser: So we could do like it was like a VR where we could actually You know, go over the like if someone had something broken, we could point out, you know, while they're looking at their phone at the machine, what needs to be done or where we needed a part number from or whatever.
Agent: Oh yeah.
EndUser: So, We, um,
EndUser: So that was what the bestifications that we had.
Agent: Yeah, because it looks like you guys had evaluated. Yeah, exactly that for some sales and some of the service capabilities as well. So again, with that pro suite is going to.
Agent: The ability as well as Marketing implementations to all in one, but it's half of the fraction of the cost truly versus what you are going to end up paying with, you know, that evaluation. So.
Agent: I understand that it's kind of a budget thing and you're going to have to roll it down through the team and kind of get all of them on board.
Agent: But curious if you have even [TIME-2] [DATE-5] after [TIME-3], we can bring you some of the details of that pro suite at least then you can digest it.
EndUser: Yeah, yeah, give me [TIME-4].
Agent: Okay, take your time.
EndUser: Because I just have to work to see what.
EndUser: I'm just gotta look. I've got something on my that I have to attend.
Agent: That's okay. We can be flexible. So if there's a time that works for you, go ahead and throw it out there.

EndUser: Hi.
Agent: Hey, how's it going?
Agent: Hey, I won't take up too much of your time.
EndUser: I'm good.
Agent: I think I left a voice spell [DATE-1] and sent an email, so I'm not sure if you had time to check it or yet, but I was calling to see if you might have heard.
EndUser: Yeah, so, right, so here's where I'm at.
Agent: Okay, go ahead.
EndUser: So [PERSON-3] is out of town until [DATE-2], probably [DATE-3], maybe later. I don't know. I know we have marketing cloud. I don't know if we've done anything with it.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I sent a note to [PERSON-3] [TIME-1] saying, see below, let me know if you want to be, you know, doing meeting together.
Agent: Got it.
EndUser: Wait, just [DATE-2] when you get back, whatever. So, I'm going to go back to the meeting. Yeah, I'm waiting to hear back from [PERSON-3] because I can't even answer you on what we're doing with marketing class.
EndUser: As far as I know, we're not doing anything.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: What?
Agent: No, I've
EndUser: But I don't know that. And maybe whoever talked to [PERSON-3] before might know the answer to that. I know that I've reached [DATE-4].
EndUser: And when I've asked her about it in the past, she hasn't really had time to get into it even though we've had it for a while.
Agent: Got it. Okay. Yeah. No, I appreciate you sharing that. We didn't really get into specifics of [PRODUCT-1] on the call that I was on with [PERSON-3].
Agent: The call was more focused on [PERSON-4], our data analytics and visualization tool.
Agent: But would you, I guess one question I would have is how are you currently communicating with your customers at [FAC-1] and how are you engaging with them?
Agent: I would be curious to learn a little bit more about that if you have [TIME-2].
EndUser: So how are we connecting with them?
EndUser: Is that what you're asking?
Agent: Yeah, I guess what's your citizen, your engagement strategy there?
EndUser: Well, we do, you know, marketing and obviously editorial handles the social media aspect.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: I do the email marketing.
Agent: Okay. Okay. Okay.

Agent: Got it.
EndUser: And then like we have the magazine, but there's a promotional wrap on each magazine cover.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So my job is marketing the store, marketing product within the store. I don't manage the website, I don't manage circulation, I don't manage social media.
Agent: That's so. Yeah, and I know [GPE-1] highways, I know it's like kind of its own separate entity, but it's still within a dot.
Agent: Is that accurate?
EndUser: Right?
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: Yeah.
Agent: Got it. So I know that I mentioned that we have a new account executive for marketing cloud, and [NORP-1].
EndUser: Right.
Agent: If so what you're describing as far as the, you know, the email campaigns, I mean, that is.
Agent: Kind of a textbook use case for what Marketing Cloud can really help with in terms of automating some of that process and you can do really good visibility into the success of those campaigns.
Agent: It also gives the unified profile of all 116,000 people that you're trying to reach out to to automate, you know, who is responding, who needs to get the next email in a sequence.
Agent: There's some features that might be helpful in terms of easing the burden on you in terms of having to manually do some of that, and also enhancing some of the efficiency or effectiveness of how the people ultimately are responding or being engaged with.
Agent: And then in terms of the store aspect, there's a component of [PRODUCT-1] called [PRODUCT-2], which is specifically geared towards actually selling a product, so not just the email campaign, but actual online website-based selling of products.
Agent: And I know that might be more [PERSON-5] if she's the webmaster, but would you have any interest in just a quick introduction meeting with [PERSON-6] just to kind of go over the basics of how Marking Cloud might be able to help out at [GPE-1] Highways?

Agent: [PERSON-7]. Touch of the
Agent: [PERSON-8].
EndUser: The key takes my copy, creates an email box, I review it, and either approve or edit it.

Agent: Ick. ch [PERSON-9].
EndUser: You know, I know in a previous position that I had [ORG-1] which was coming on as I was kind of exiting out but we would have, you know, we emailed last that went out every [DATE-8] about concerts but then like if there was a specific type of concert.
Agent: Thank you.
Agent: You know... didn't set
EndUser: Wireless but that needed an additional footage, we would follow all the drum concert ticket buyers, all the jazz ticket buyers or [NORP-2] music ticket buyers.
EndUser: You know, so I have that knowledge, you know, and using like, it might be a list of two thousand versus a hundred thousand, but, you know, with very targeted to those previous tickets here.
EndUser: I just don't know if it's worth having a conversation without [PERSON-3]. That's why I want to wait and see what her thoughts were.
EndUser: You know, so just give me a day for her to respond and then I can get back with you.
Agent: Okay. Yep, no, that sounds good. There's no rush on our end. I just thought I'd reach out because then I was going to be in the [GPE-2] area [DATE-9].
Agent: She's from [GPE-1] originally, but she lives in [GPE-3] now. But yeah, I mean, there's no rush on our end. We just, you know, as a current customer, A. B and a current customer.
Agent: And given that [PERSON-3] had mentioned [PRODUCT-1] previously, I just wanted to reach out and see if a quick introduction would be of interest.
EndUser: Yeah, so let me see what she says. I've got your email. I've got your quiz now. So I just, I had reached out to her for three and just waiting to hear back. But that's what I know.
Agent: Yeah. Sounds great. No, I appreciate you sharing all that. And I will look forward to hearing from you at some point, maybe [DATE-10]. And yeah, hope you have [DATE-13].

Agent: So if I recap this now, I should then get a summary. So I'll recap it one more time just to test the technology and see if it's supposed to do a book.
Agent: So yeah, as you've said, you're probably doing it for customer connect. As [PERSON-1] and [PERSON-2] said, so [PRODUCT-1] options, I think this [ORG-1] is what this is called that I'm using right now. So that's [PERSON-3] conversation insight.
Agent: So anytime.
Agent: Your business development reps will have calls wit h potential candidates or whatever it might be They can use this tool to record and identify next best steps an d it just saves them having to take notes So I think you obviously want to understand more about what our [PRODUCT-1] platform can do The configuration thing about being able to mask change the ownership of contacts and then the reporting side of things from business development activities per regio n and funneling them up to the very top so everyone can see what's going o n in business development activity because of the moment You did mention that on your team you see and you don't have that visibility at a high level is that righ t. Yes, some people
Speaker 2: Who have on top of [DATE-1] have this high level view, but then have performance issue and also to have this more vision per client than.
Speaker 2: Yeah, also that could be really interesting is to see what else we could do regarding chapter functionalities and follow from.
Agent: And then something else
Speaker 2: So, I see when you click on follow what it is that we could enable to have a notification that I'm relevant to you. I think you know to show face information relevant to people.
Agent: So in terms of, would you mind just explaining that a little bit deep sides?
Agent: I'm not super well versed in the customer connection. So we use chatter internally ourselves.
Agent: So if I wanted someone to update something on the org, I could chatter them and be like, hi, I asked, would you please update this to reflect what happened?
Agent: Yes. I saying to.
Speaker 2: Was use as well.
Agent: Yes. That's what we
Speaker 2: But you know, in terms of you can also create group, broadcast, you know, the fiction you could use in the, in the chat on groups as well. already used.
Speaker 2: And we also have the standard option in [ORG-2] to follow some record.
Agent: And what it is that you couldn't make because we we could do much more about that.
Speaker 2: Use that to teach very minimum.
Agent: I'm sure So see what else can be done.
Agent: So sounds like that in terms of configuration, it's the chatter functionality, chatter groups following certain records and understanding what you can actually do with chatter because you already have to do that.
Agent: Yeah, other configuration thing is the mass change on the strip of contacts.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And the
Agent: Yes. And so there's no function.
Agent: Functionality down the line is the reporting on the business development activities Yes You have to in all the different data, whether it be from the [PRODUCT-2] or external dat a sources to have those .
Speaker 2: Pull
Agent: Really detailed reports and also when it's available. It's exploring the [PRODUCT-1], especially the call summaries, I think, as well. Yes, yes. Anything else in terms of management objectives, issues
Speaker 2: That this top of mind or does that sort of summarize everything?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean, you've been on the line also. It's, you know, we see that we really exploit exploit. I mean, use of database of candidate and contact.
Agent: A very small percentage
Speaker 2: So how we could, you know, leverage more surface more relevant information at the right time is the best practice in terms of data
Agent: Quality or data management that you could share all these kind of things. So you're saying you have a massive database of potential <inaudible> to reach out to, but you're only targeting a very small percentage of jobs. Exactly.
Agent: Same compliance.
Agent: Are you marketing?
Speaker 2: Are you Marketing to them with any automation or anything like that at the moment?
Speaker 2: So we Marketing clouds and products.
Agent: Do some Marketing campaigns,
Speaker 2: So we do that.
Agent: But in the end, we still are getting a very small part of our database.
Agent: So I suppose you are potentially, I know this is obviously a lot of different things, but it sounds like is a bit of a data plans needed and then you know, to.
Speaker 2: There
Agent: Target more.
Agent: And how do you do you want to put more contacts into Marketing campaigns?
Speaker 2: Do you want the system to be able to help reps identify the best candidates to reach out to?
Speaker 2: Exactly. I think the tendency is not so much to regarding the volume, but the quality. So you would rather target less people with the right ones.
Agent: So how can we face the right ones?
Agent: Let's say. Okay. Yeah. So the good few action points here. So we've got the couple, obviously, obviously [PRODUCT-1] and then the recording, then the configuration is the contacts and chatter.
Agent: And then obviously then we have the SEO to identify
Speaker 2: The next best people to reach out to. And you were excited. You were about to say something where you.
Speaker 2: No, I am saying that I think the data quality piece is also very linked to the AI because you can
Agent: Only leverage AI if you have clean data, right?
Speaker 2: So,
Agent: What are the... Yeah, the fundamental... Yeah. So AI also does your data. Yeah, that's... Okay. No, that's interesting. And either I know these are very broad things we discussed in terms of... priority.
Agent: So I suppose let's say the tree, so we'll do the obviously configuration, we'll get answers to but the priority of the visibility of business development activity, [PRODUCT-1], and then the data quality.

Agent: No, they aren't. So we're trying to figure out like if we could be helpful in this equation at all.

EndUser: It was expensive, right?
Agent: I would hear.
EndUser: And we weren't probably using that to the level we needed to back when I was with [GPE-1]. So.

Agent: Who would you suggest I reach out to about this?
Agent: Who is like looking in the hub slot to?
EndUser: That would be, most likely, I mean, ultimately would be [PERSON-1]. We'd probably be making that fine decision.
Agent: Okay, [PERSON-2].
EndUser: But [PERSON-3], who leads the marketing, she had, she was tied to [PRODUCT-2]. And then potentially [PERSON-4]. I don't know if you have the information from an IQ standpoint.

Agent: Ok. Oh,
EndUser: It's [DATE-1] before it was So I'd always been pretty close to it and you know when we're doing a lot of customization before they had a lot of the out of the box stuff So supporting our product shopper and some of those things but No, I've sales I mean again from a sales perspective the main Who's running the sales show now is Recently is [PERSON-6] And I don't know if you probably have his information because he was in charge of [GPE-3].
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: He's up in [GPE-3], but he's now doing [LOC-1].
Agent: Oh, he's, yes, yes. I did notice his role changing.

Agent: How are you like getting aware of all your customers and stuff?
EndUser: Well, we it was a quick transition away from it, so we're doing some little bit of home-grown type stuff. We have a lot of information.
EndUser: We're still using [ORG-2], but from a Marketing perspective using [PRODUCT-2], they had already been using that and using that in parallel with [ORG-1].
Agent: Oh.
Agent: Okay.
EndUser: So I think they were going to, since they already had that and kept that, they were going to maybe build that CRM portion of it out with Sales support.
EndUser: Eventually, I don't know where they're at with that, but for a little bit there, we were kind of not running blind.
EndUser: I mean, we took a lot of really good information, but you know, it definitely wasn't a robust CRM-like [ORG-1].
Agent: Okay, that totally makes sense. So I know you said that the, I'm sorry for all these questions, but this is super helpful. He said that they reduce the workforce a lot.
Agent: How did that affect the service teams, sales teams?
Agent: Especially.
EndUser: Really also assets, but definitely sales teams.
Agent: How interesting.
EndUser: More using third party outside sales, a purse. Yeah, so. This is some changes.
Agent: Oh.
EndUser: I mean, some of it was winning up. Some of it made sense with the rental, obviously, you know, which is, you know, companies bought 4129.
EndUser: So when you remove a service support type business, like rental, you know, obviously not need as many folks. So, you know.
Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. I just assume that since they're going to be focusing a lot more on the sales selling instead of rental that they might need more. salespeople for that, but that makes total sense. Okay, great.
Agent: Well, this has been super helpful. I really appreciate anything else you think that would be good for me to know moving forward.
EndUser: I'm still pretty tight. I mean, it's still family. Some folks over there. But nothing that that brings the bell up because they're, you know. a lot of new direction they might be going in.

007797_167_6qr3y000000ocmnAAA,"Agent: Right.
Speaker 3: Okay, also that's this
EndUser: Just started, hasn't it?
EndUser: So is a complaints case basically. And this is the kind of [ORG-1] where any communications that have already been sent would be displayed. So there's nothing in there at the moment.
EndUser: But if we wanted to do a [DATE-1] won't, for example, we would select now.
EndUser: This is the template that I referred to, and then the comms reference, which will basically set the kind of header and footer, and then the references, any [ORG-2] that we've got set up in there.
EndUser: So this is a basic acknowledgement one, but we have different ones in there around kind of four. We hold eight, we hold, et cetera, et cetera.
EndUser: So if we just selected one of those, and then what we can do is preview it, and then this is the PDF preview that we've kind of settled. in there.
EndUser: So as you can see this is the template at the top and then the references, the kind o f Content that goes into it . So it's got loads of information around, you know, just acknowledging it.
EndUser: Links to the [ORG-3], etc, etc. So that's the preview screen and you can see that we've got the footer and it fits within the kind of boundaries there.
EndUser: But what we're finding is that if, for example, we needed to change anything in this content, it may go into the footer or it might just have a line on the next page, for example.
EndUser: So it's just really difficult for us to kind of manage that kind of Content of what the letter looks like.
EndUser: But if send, what that would then do is it would display in the comms hub, hopefully, once it's sent.
Agent: I was to click
EndUser: So you can see here that an entry has just gone into the comms hub, it's actually put two entries in the comms hub, which I will have a look at separately.
EndUser: Oh, it's done it twice because this has got a third party. So sometimes what might happen is a solicitor or a [ORG-4] might get in touch with us on behalf of the customer.
EndUser: So this actual complaint has got a third party on it. So what it would do is it would reply to the third party, the solicitor, for example, but it also sends a copy to the customer as well.
EndUser: So there are two different kind of parameters that are in there.
EndUser: So if it was that it was an automatic, the same approach would happen, but you know, you wouldn't need to select no, it would just acknowledge it at a certain point of time.
EndUser: But it's all about how we can kind of manage those PDF contents.
EndUser: And then what happens in the background is that PDF, there'll be an [TIME-1] batch that is sent to [ORG-5] through the API, and then they would do the kind of onward send to the customer.
EndUser: So we're not using your email functionality for this It does go through [ORG-5] because we've got an existing contract with them to actually send the emails We do however use the email . component here for some other emails.
EndUser: So our [ORG-6] emails, for example, which is a data request, basically, when a customer contacts and says, I want to copy of all the information that you hold on me. We can do an email through [ORG-7] that way.
EndUser: And I think if we can go into [ORG-8], or I've not got it in this org, Um,
EndUser: No, we don't need to create a lot of that.
EndUser: There's no one cross-borne, is there?
EndUser: It'll be my orca. Um, we do have, I'm sure we had, we had a template option here. So this gives us access to those other templates.
EndUser: That we had so we could insert kind of the D so back in there.
Agent: And then that
EndUser: Shows that that email within and then you would just select in there and then you would click the quick text to to basically build. the email content.
EndUser: So we are using your email component for a few, but they tend to be more ad hoc requests that we send. The majority are sent through this console because we've got that paragon interaction as well.
Agent: And it needs to go out by a paragon, does it?
EndUser: There's no way you could change to using the [ORG-7] email. So at the moment it does because we've exclusivity within the contract with [ORG-5].
Agent: Got an
Agent: I
EndUser: Don't know what dates each up to [PERSON-1], I'd need to find that out. But the exclusivity with [ORG-5] are for our warranty emails and our complaint emails.
EndUser: So as we move forward and we bring more complete and stuff into [ORG-7], we might have other options and we would want to put that out straight away.
Agent: More common
EndUser: But the complaints
Agent: Stuff for the time and it has to have the API to paragon Yes, I guess the other benefit is that it doesn't exist it will be .
EndUser: If the email address is wrong or
Agent: Do the letter of course. Yeah, it does not work. It does not work. It does not work. It does not work.
Agent: So, so it's really about the formatting, isn't it?
EndUser: Yeah. OK,
Agent: Yeah. And yeah, if you have
EndUser: To... change it in some way, it's moving into the footer or something like that. It's like a community.
EndUser: I suppose what rapper is like a bit of a comms management suite of such and whether that's kind of a plug-in that you can compose the email etc.
EndUser: Within that you can store it, it's got library, you can easily amend it.
EndUser: It's kind of like a management suite that we're after for comms and then you basically select what you want out of this management and you can you know compose that PDF.
Agent: Suite
EndUser: And we've, we've really busted eyes to kind of create something. And we've just got so many kind of issues that we're seeing with it and the kind of quality that we're seeing
Agent: Isn't the greatest which waiting for the [ORG-9] to pause upon it so Oh really?
EndUser: Okay, okay. I mean it's all been signed off by compliance and obviously we've been using it since I think the world's out in [DATE-2]. We've heard no noise yet but yeah if you compare
Agent: It with some of the other communications we send out the quality as you write. Yeah okay cool. All right yeah let me have a look into it.
Agent: Yeah I see what we're saying if you feel more like if there's something maybe on the app exchange or something like that, that can be a plug-in of some sort that takes a much more comprehensive, maybe even content-driven kinds of communications.
EndUser: Approach to these
Agent: So that is just a much neater way of doing things.
EndUser: Yeah, and I don't know, and we'd need to do a bit of a spike with the tech guys around how they've actually built it because, we built a solution and then when it became for release that's where it started to overwrite the footer so we changed something there so I don't know whether they've got something that's plugged in or anything I don't know what the infrastructure looks like so it might be a bit of engineer to engineer conversation to say, well, what have you got [DATE-3]?
EndUser: Just to avoid, you know, you're suggesting what we're kind of currently already using. But yeah, I think I would be reluctant to put any more comms into it with this solution that we've got.
EndUser: So it's just trying to find an alternative really.
Agent: Yeah, okay. Okay, cool. I think I understand it perfectly. Thank you for that. I'll do some digging and see what we can
EndUser: Come up with. No, that would be great. Thanks, [PERSON-1]. Broly, if you need any more information, let me know.
EndUser: Let's keep talking about what the options are and we can get some time into one of the next sprints to do a bit of an explore, [PERSON-2].
Agent: Yeah, of course. No problem.
EndUser: It's good.
Speaker 3: Well, thank you for your time, [PERSON-3]. We'll be

Agent: Good, how about yourself?
EndUser: Don't break it.
Agent: Good to hear. But I know when you replied that you said unfortunately, you guys have an internal [PRODUCT-1].
Agent: Just wanted to let you know for context, that I'm actually part of the [ORG-1] and automation and arm of [ORG-2], specifically called [PERSON-3]. Not sure of your familiarity with us.
EndUser: Not familiar now.
Agent: Okay, so yeah, typically what we hear is like whether that [PRODUCT-1] is like salesforce or an internal [PRODUCT-1]. Sometimes people struggle getting data in and out.
Agent: Whether that be connecting it to like some core banking systems or even automation on the [PRODUCT-1] or integrations that involve CSV file. So I was just curious if that's something you may be running into with the internal [PRODUCT-1].
EndUser: No, we're actually okay on that front oddly. We can import and export [ORG-3] relatively well.
Agent: Arrived right.
EndUser: Something that, and it's not something that I have budget for right now, but in terms of automation, analytics, a bigger project that we are thinking about is, like we have a data set that numbers something like 150,000 pieces of data, which is not a particularly large number, but it's too large to be able to do anything manual with.
EndUser: And so that would be something of a [WORK_OF_ART-1]. That's something that Mules soft does as well or no.
Agent: Yeah, so we can do, I guess what you can say, like we have robotics processes automation [ORG-4]. So like with the CSV files, I can have like these hundreds of thousands of spreadsheets.
Agent: If someone has to do any manual data entry, this bot can like track. This person's movements and then automate that and do that essentially near real time.
Agent: Obviously, I'm not necessarily too technical on some of this stuff and I am catching out of the blue, but.
Agent: Is that something that makes sense or kind of aligns with that project that you're talking about?
EndUser: Yeah, it could. So I have a guy on my team who's away from [DATE-1], but he's kind of the guy that I rely on on the technology side.
EndUser: So if you were to send me some information and I can give you his email as well. then he and I could huddle on it and come back to you.
EndUser: And right, again, I'm going to be completely honest with you.
Agent: Yeah, that'd be.
EndUser: At this stage, this is completely exploratory because we don't have budget for it and we actually just fired like [PERCENT-1] of our team.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: So I don't anticipate getting budget quickly for it in [DATE-2].
Agent: Oh.
EndUser: But the interesting thing there is like some of the stuff that we're talking about here could very well end up leading to Productivity enhancements, efficiency enhancements, right?
EndUser: So.
Agent: Exactly.
EndUser: But anyway, just so I'm completely transparent with you, it's not like I'm going to go sign a contract [DATE-3], but it is something that we're actively trying to design solutions around.
Agent: Right.
Agent: Yeah, and totally understand like I've had some conversations with some other folks in [ORG-5] and know that these things are happening and really just like cutting the cost of some things is kind of a big initiative.
Agent: But no, we're not trying to sign the contract [DATE-3].
EndUser: That's. Yeah.
Agent: But yeah, I can send over some stuff for you.
Agent: And then you can huddle internally with like how you work with and then we'll be in touch to see if we can set up an educational chat around some of the stuff we do here and maybe more of the specifics about your project currently.
EndUser: Sure. So the other guy's email is [PERSON-4], O-W-E-N dot [PERSON-5] And [PERSON-6].
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
Agent: Perfect. I'll send over some resources for you briefly and just to confirm your emails at Jeremy.moshur. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly at [PERSON-6].
EndUser: Nailed it.
Agent: Oh, let's go.
EndUser: No one gets it right, but you got it right. Good job.
Agent: Awesome. Well, thanks.
EndUser: All
Agent: Thanks so much for your time, [PERSON-1], and you have a good one.
EndUser: Right. OK, cool. Thank you.

EndUser: Go ahead. Yeah, it's like an [ORG-2] system, yep. Yep.
Agent: Ok, not a problem.
Agent: And is there any sort of cluster relationship management tool on top of that system that you're currently using?
EndUser: There is one, but to be honest, we don't use it to our best capabilities, if you will.
Agent: Ok.
EndUser: I think the system offers a lot. We don't necessarily use it. We tend to use a lot of manual systems to be honest with Okay.
Agent: And do you know why that is?
Agent: Is it just kind of ease of use or just kind of adoption?
EndUser: You.
EndUser: It's just the way it's been since I can remember anyway, right?
Agent: Yeah. Absolutely.
EndUser: I mean, we've looked at the opportunity [ORG-3] might bring every once in a while, but I just, doesn't seem to, it never really inspires many people to really jump on it to be honest with you.
Agent: Absolutely.
EndUser: I know my VP has looked at it as well, but our current systems are kind of doing what they need to do, I guess.
Agent: Mm hmm.
Agent: Yeah, for sure.

Agent: And then after that, we're being left with kind of disparate books, if you will, that people are trying to consolidate.

004615_167_6qr3y000000ofRoAAI,"Speaker 2: Thank you.
Agent: So, and it's not there's no like requisite with Sales Cloud where for every sales cause user you need a [ORG-1] license and it truly is based on who actually needs access to the features and functions that come with [ORG-2] contracts.
Speaker 2: And it's
Agent: Pretty straightforward in that regard, like typically how we outline who would need access.
Agent: Is any user that would need to author and negotiate contracts, users who would generate the document, edit it, or send it for signature?
Agent: Users who work on any of the obligations or pre-approved clause libraries or change them in any And then users who administer the contracts tool, if you just needed to see an output document, then you wouldn't need a license.
Speaker 2: Way.
Agent: You can have the document and it's generated tie back to the opportunity and you can just open up and see it.
Agent: But if you wanted to make wanted to see a certain field, if you wanted to edit a clause library, like that's what's going to designate, hey, you need a license provisioned.
Speaker 2: Any change, if you
Speaker 3: Okay, you'll see
Agent: More in depth obviously when we demo it, it'll give you a very clear idea, but that's how we provision our licenses.
Agent: So with that being said, if there's any guidance you can provide us on numbers of users that we should, you know, forecast when we put together pricing, you know, that would help us a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can look at the numbers a bit more when I get home and can actually like look at the active users in front of me.
Speaker 2: But I would say like off the bat, all of the folks we gave for the like, you know, power user and whatever the middle tier was those absolutely so maybe like. I don't know, maybe somewhere around 250. Okay.
Agent: Or
Speaker 2: Like 221, because there are definitely some folks with sales force licenses [DATE-1] that won't need access to that.
Speaker 2: So I think we need to do a bit of thinking of who those people are, but I would say, like, you know, off the top of my head, probably a little below the number, you know, the number they've given.
Agent: Okay. And so then, So all of those users, 154 or 217 of them, all of those fall into the categories of users who would need to offer negotiate contracts, edit them, open them, send them for signature.
Agent: Work on the clause just to make sure before we get that
Speaker 2: Where we administer number for pricing approval.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so like we ops teams, right?
Agent: Have our legal
Speaker 2: Who are going to be the ones the legal team will be doing like any of the authoring of the clauses, you know, the templates, anything like that.
Speaker 2: Ops team will be helping administrate that and then essentially anyone on the sale team offering contracts, proposals, whatever it may will be
Agent: Be. So that could be anyone across the sale team. Perfect.
Speaker 2: Okay, great. I feel good about that number then. I appreciate it. But I think there are some folks. Yeah, like we have some Implementation folks, right, who have sales force licenses right now, who won't need to do that.
Speaker 2: We have some like, you know, product specialists who don't often need to do that. So we could probably slim that number down because not every single
Agent: Person into else force is going to need the ability to do that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That see it that way as well, where it's a sense of your total users, rather than every single user.
Speaker 2: Makes sense. We typically
Agent: Basically, you broke in those departments between sales off legal and the sales team. They're actually documents and manipulating them.
Speaker 2: Creating the output
Agent: Yeah, the customer. Those three buckets are typical parties Yeah, thanks.
Speaker 2: That would need a license provision.
Agent: That's okay. Okay, well, that being said, it's honestly pretty short and sweet. That's all the information that that I have [DATE-1] and Just one clarification.
Speaker 2: You've given us good guidance.
Agent: Does I make sure should we go in with 241 or 125?
Speaker 2: Want to make sure I understand that correctly.
Speaker 2: Um, why don't if you're okay with it?
Speaker 2: Why don't when I get home?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I did. You used [ORG-1] Yeah, I've used [ORG-1] for such a long time.
Agent: In the past, right?
Agent: I noticed.
Speaker 2: But like as you know, each organization uses it very differently. So yeah, let me share my screen.
Agent: Sure. It's on the bottom.
Speaker 2: All right, do you see it?
Speaker 2: I will. So I made this strong lead or strong contact relationship and as soon as I put it in a new contact, it duplicates it with it at the cold level as well.
Agent: Okay, so show me an example from beginning ten.
Speaker 2: So I did.
Agent: Yeah,
Speaker 2: Let's just use her.
Speaker 2: You're recording, right?

Speaker 2: I guess it's here. So let's see if I put it in a strong. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that didn't work because it was a... Let me try to do it. Yeah.

Agent: So you're doing recently viewed and knew so, yeah, it might... So go to the actual account and do new. You have to explain to us.

Speaker 2: Do this.
Agent: I'm not covering answer any questions on it. Got it. That's great.
Agent: I
Agent: Think
Speaker 2: We're all going to get it. I'm going to go through all of this.

Speaker 2: So, I do I'm pretty open.
Agent: That for you. The opening. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I saved it. I go. I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And so it's good now. But I watch when I edit the stage and I create it as a strong relationship.
Agent: We want to do half of the tower.
Speaker 2: And I know it's not doing it. Course.
Agent: It's the yeah, there's a saying about that. I think I got what it is.

Agent: Yeah, but it happens to me all the time. You want to show a glitch and all of a sudden it's working when some notes.
Speaker 2: You got to see if there's
Speaker 2: Maybe I'm making it out of the wrong view.
Speaker 2: Like here's another one. I made it. And there's this level that's cold in this level that's.
Agent: Oh, yeah, maybe what you did when you were editing a relationship as you clicked on like safe and new or something instead of just safe.
Speaker 2: Okay, maybe that's it.
Speaker 2: I'll be more cognizant of what I'm doing there, but I guess more importantly, so you're not able to see my outlook browser, are you?
Agent: I know unless you stop sharing and share that but don't accidentally click the end call button. I know I do that all the time. I'm Yeah, stop presenting.
Speaker 2: Not presenting.

Speaker 2: So like, and you go back into a sent email and try and choose someone to add in a [ORG-1] to, like this.
Agent: So like previous sent emails, I. Of Would have to check.
Speaker 2: Course it's working.
Agent: Yeah, now it seems Will be.

Agent: Ok.
Agent: If probably like this come up also, if you have an option to like. The lead history, the lead some cash, some cookies, that type of thing. It's usually helpful.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it looks like it's working now. So if I go to a new email, then following up.
Agent: So the agenda that we have to write. So what we want to come out of that. So this is why I have totally useless.
Speaker 2: To make it to the cover Detail If I go to a new email, see in the agenda.
Agent: As the only age I'm to need to do the thing. I'm just posting.
Speaker 2: Where would I track from here?
Agent: Oh, because it's not showing up, you're saying. So if you click Apps, Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is there a way for the sale?
Speaker 2: This to exist permanently?
Speaker 2: Like when I pin it, it disappears.
Agent: Yeah. There is. So like the short answer is that it's through [ORG-2], which is like a dedicated tool. We have specifically for that.
Agent: We can talk more about that, like, in a separate conversation, if it even makes sense for you to have it. But to give you like a permanent solution, it's an add-on.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Agent: But like, but at high level though, like, by having this feature, what does that kind of help you accomplish?
Speaker 2: Yeah,
Speaker 2: Just make sure I'm tracking as I go versus like remembering after the fact and then tracking.
Agent: Yeah.
Agent: Have other sales reps. Do they use this feature?
Agent: Is it only for you?
Speaker 2: I think it's only for me because I think we've all come from different sales for us usage backgrounds.
Agent: Yep.
Speaker 2: So I think what I used to have was like this bar used to always exist. So I would just hit save as I'm, it would automatically pull contact is in the system and then automatically do it.
Agent: Whenever
Agent: Yeah. So I guess versus
Speaker 2: Clicking to open up [ORG-1] each time like you see me do you see how I'm doing this?
Agent: Yeah
Speaker 2: It would just be easier if it's already open. I just click on an email and it loads like here's all the The context in our salesforce system for who you're talking to

007288_167_0LQ3y000009GhAxGAK,"Agent: Now I'm calling out the blue, so I do appreciate you taking the time out to chat with me.
Agent: The reason why I was calling was I wanted to see if you had maybe [TIME-1], either sometime later on [DATE-1] or the following for us to chat briefly at a more appropriate time.
Agent: The reason why I was reaching out just for a quick overview and background is because I wanted to learn a little bit more about [LOC-1] and kind of get an idea of what you guys are currently utilizing across different sides of the business.
Agent: Here at [ORG-1], we've been doing some research and been hearing within your industry that most companies are using different platforms across different sides of the business, wanting to see if that might be the same case for [LOC-2] and wanting to know like what might be top of mind as you guys go into [DATE-2] to see if we can align with anything.
EndUser: Yeah, no, I mean, if I don't know how long this is going to be, it's going to take, you can check for [TIME-2], I can give you a quick background in terms of where we are and what to expect and so on.
Agent: Yeah, for sure.
EndUser: Or if you know, this could be much faster. I actually worked with [ORG-1] in my prior, prior position. [ORG-1] was kind of the default solution for not only the [PRODUCT-1] but all of a sudden ERP.
EndUser: So I've worked with lightning and a lot of applications that you worked with as part of [ORG-1] environment. So I'm somewhat familiar with all the functionality and capabilities.
EndUser: Currently, it was in [GPE-1] and it's been great, but it's been very expensive.
Agent: Oh. Yeah.
EndUser: So it definitely a great tool and it really depends on the company here at [LOC-3]. We have only small crew in sales and most of our sales are in seafood business, which is more occurring.
EndUser: It's not as much as a development of new opportunities in pipeline. So we're not looking at their robust solution.
EndUser: And so we went with [DATE-3] and [DATE-3] has a kind of tiny little [PRODUCT-1] functionality, module that we have been using and it's mostly the based on cost because the license doesn't cost much at all.
EndUser: And so We are continuing to leverage the [PRODUCT-1] project management and so we bought a few licenses.
Agent: Yes. Yeah.
EndUser: In the end, I'm using it actually on my own most of the time. The scale we're using is very limited to just basically track opportunities and nothing fancy.
EndUser: The assessment is that [ORG-1] would be an [ORG-2] for the type of business we are right now. It's just too sophisticated, too expensive.
EndUser: We're just getting away with some simple tool that we can just check opportunities and status and it seems to be working.
EndUser: Okay, so Yeah, I mean, I just want to give you a brief summary of where I am and what you're thinking Yeah.
Agent: Yeah. And I totally, I appreciate you providing with the information. I definitely understand where you're coming from.
Agent: What I will say is now would be at the time for us to have that quick conversation because we are in our Q4 and we're doing being more flexible with our pricing and wanting to meet our customers, where their budget is and what they're wanting to invest.
Agent: So if you do have that quick [TIME-1] for us to kind of, Give you an overview of the success we've seen with other companies.
Agent: I'm happy to hear that you have used those for us before, so you're kind of familiar with it.
Agent: We can definitely align with anything that would be top of mind if you have that quick moment for us to provide.
EndUser: You know what- I don't think anyone else has used [ORG-1] in this company, just me. And it's because I happen to be in the company that was in a creative agency of business.
EndUser: And it made a lot of sense and they standardized on everything on [ORG-1]. They used [ORG-1] and designed all their production processes, everything, sales, up to billing and purchasing [ORG-1].
EndUser: So I spent a lot of time with [ORG-1] in [DATE-4]. But here, it's new completely.
Agent: Yeah.
EndUser: And my only concern would be the cost thing, that we are really not limited. We're not using much of functionality. And what we are tracking, the tools that are out there are very simple and configurable.
EndUser: It's kind of hard. I just couldn't see the payback, I guess, on the investment. But if somebody wants to talk to me [DATE-5], it's fine. Let me see if I can give you a slot.
Agent: Yeah, what time would work then?
EndUser: I'll be available on [DATE-6] [TIME-3].
Agent: Okay, and you're in [ORG-3], that correct?
EndUser: Yes, I'm on a specific time, but it could be at [TIME-4].
Agent: Uh, wait, let me see.
Agent: Would 2PM Pacific time work for you?
EndUser: No, it's fine. Yeah, it's fine.
Agent: Or or better yet, does 168 work?
EndUser: Yeah, it's fine.
Agent: I know what you, I know you mentioned earlier, [TIME-5] will work, right?
EndUser: Not, I'm really fine. Either way is good. So whatever works for you, I don't want to go up to a clock. OK.
Agent: Okay. Well, I can definitely accommodate you and do that [TIME-6] for you.
